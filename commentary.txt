makarova slumps back into making unforced errors again as she finds the net with her first forehand of the game , while her second is n't much better as she overhits when attempting to clip the baseline . sharapova hits an accurate serve down the 't ' to bring up three set points . another pinpoint serves proves too difficult to return as the number two seed claims the first set .
just look in her match with heather watson last week , serena is desperate to shake herself into action . she lets out an almighty shriek when she goes 30-15 up , but azarenka responds with a brilliant forehand . the level of williams ' scream goes up and up during the next point , and she lets out another roar when she belts a forehand cross court win the point . she wraps the game up next time round , and she looked something like back to her best there !

the forehand deserts hampton this time . she got too much on it and the ball sailed past the baseline . it 's not over 'til it 's over ... but it might be over ...
serena still looks sluggish but she at least held serve with relative ease . i do n't think that there is any danger of her pulling out . she will understand that bacsinszky will feel the tension as she looks to make her first final .
muguruza has the chance to reach 0-30 after chasing down a drop shot , but she flicks a forehand just long of the baseline . however , two mistakes from radwanska hand two set points to the spaniard , but she shows a drastic improvement to reel off four points in a row to remain alive in the set .
li smacks a terrible second serve into the tramlines to give the czech set point , and she then goes long to gift her the set . li was very poor there and the czech did enough to take advantage .

kanepi rushes a pair of serves and looks to be a struggling a touch with her ball toss , giving robson an opening at 30-30. the brit fails to capitalise though , showing nerves of her own with a wayward unforced error at the baseline . a challenge from robson then proves fruitless , giving kanepi a hold she desperately needed for confidence .

keys puts williams on the back foot with an excellent serve , which the 33-year-old can not return . keys does it again as she looks in rhythm on her service game , and that continues as the number one seed can lay a racquet on the next serve as it travels with speed down the middle . keys gifts a point to williams with a backhand into the net , but then produces a winner on the next point to secure the hold .
two more superb backhand winners move sharapova 15-30 then 30-40 ahead . however , she fails to convert break point as knapp takes three points in a row and holds .
williams drills down a 122mph serve , and it helps her edge into the lead . the american goes long on the next , indicating that she is struggling with the wind , and a lob on the next drifts long and azarenka is two points away from forcing a decider . oh my ! the wind plays its part again , and williams nets ! two set points to azarenka . a fine serve out wide saves the first , and the second is saved with some superb shots that force azarenka to net !

safarova starts with an ace before she outlasts ivanovic is a high-quality rally that ends with a huge winner into the corner . ivanovic gets some good fortune with a net cord to halve the deficit and a double fault from safarova sees the score progress to 30-30. the czech hands ivanovic two opportunities to seal a second break but on both occasions , her first comes up trumps . a third opening for ivanovic also goes begging and safarova is eventually able to hold . that could prove to be an important game .
finally a hold of serve . radwanska is suddenly looking very good - although there was a lot of resistance from the italian . now , two games after serving for the match , she serves to stay in the set .
makarova literally serves up a gift , souble faulting at break point . the second seed now has a second chance to consolidate a break . no-one wants to hold their serve and it 's a bit edgy .
gotcha ! a superb forehand stroke wrong-foots bartoli and sharapova has a break . a hold next time up could spell the end for the bart .
azarenka is struggling with her accuracy , hitting balls out on the first three points of the game to give li triple break point . a backhand winner saves the first , before she reacts well after the sixth seed gets a lucky hit off the net chord . li has the chance to fire her backhand in to an open court , but her effort is low and fails to clear the net , bringing up deuce . a long return from the chinese player gives azarenka advantage , and she seals it with a forehand down the sideline . a missed opportunity for li .

fantastic from azarenka . she gets the advantage before scuttling around the court keeping the next point alive . the belarusian then hits a backhand down the line to hold . neither of these two are giving this one up easily .
she holds comfortably to follow up and ivanovic has her second chance to serve for the set . early signs that this one might go to three sets , i reckon .
it was imperative that barty got off to a positive start in this second set , but another winner helps serena to three break points . however , barty shows plenty of fight to take the next two points , the second of which was a forehand winner down the line , but she hits the tape with an attempted backhand winner and she 's going to be up against it from here .
sharapova is finding things much more comfortable on her serve . she holds to 15 , despite a double fault . the next break is crucial in this one .

dear oh dear , after failing to challenge that ball lisicki drops serve . a double fault moved bartoli 0-40 ahead before an ace saved the first . she ca n't stop bartoli on the next though as her drop shot is easily reached by the 15th seed who then puts away an easy volley presented to her .
jankovic is growing agitated and is trying desperately to get her break back . she twice throws the lead away in the game , before earning a break point when sharapova hits a poor effort out . she managed to use her pace to keep the point alive three times before sharapova meets the ball with a huge swing on the drive volley to send it to deuce . the russian is evidently delighted when taking advantage and she shakes her fist in happiness , but just puts the break point out of bounds to level it up . scenes are repeatedly shortly after though as the serb again hits her shot too long . sharapova moves herself on the verge of victory with a great winner . she really is giving her all .
kvitova tries to change the pace up with a couple of sliced shots , but her backhand hits the net chord before dropping back on her side of the court . pennetta tries to get her opponent moving behind the basline , and it results in a wide effort down the sideline from kvitova . however , the czech has the chance to serve for the opening set next .
williams fails to score a point during her own service game , sharapova is in sensational form . she was never going to secure another 6-0 6-0 today , but it does n't look like she 's going to let too many more games get away from her . this performance will worry a few of the other top seeds .

kuznetsova displays a great range of shots in a lengthy rally to take a 30-0 lead , eventually catching williams out with a drop shot . the world number one digs deep , running the length of the baseline on more than one occasion to get herself back into the game , which she clinches when kuznetsova returns the ball to the net . williams seems to have put her shaky spell behind her , but the russian has another chance to serve for the set .
break : azarenka forces sharapova backwards with two punishing forehands and the russian finds the net .
excellent tennis all round on the first point of the game as the women exchange several powerful shots before makarova finally works halep over with a fine forehand . a strong serve follows from the russian , but halep forces her way in the game with a venomous strike on a short return from the 26-year-old . mistakes from makarova brings about deuce in the game , but she ups the ante late on to take a 4-2 lead with the aid of a poor shot from the romanian .

doi opens up with a double fault , but gets back on track for 15-15. however , she fires two forehands long of the baseline to hand kvitova two break points . she saves them both , but after conceding a third , she nets and the number seven seed has the early advantage .

but it 's stephens who edges back in front in this second set .
li 's serve is better this time around , finding the first ace of the match . the chinese player has more power than azarenka and she uses it to good effect to force mistakes from her opponent . however , a shot to the net from the sixth seed brings up deuce , but two long shots from the world number one give li the first hold of the match .
kvitova is starting to look a little weary , making yet another double fault before carelessly hitting her forehand into the net , giving pennetta a chance to break . the italian tries to seal it with a drop shot , but kvitova sprints in to to it to deuce . the fifth seed misses a backhand though , allowing the italian to seal with with a stunning backhand down the line . she 'll serve the level the match next .
jankovic is doing all she can to deny sharapova this set , as she hammers her way to a 40-15 lead . sharapova then just missed the baseline on the break point to hand jankovic the set .
it 's another break and again watson is too slow to get into the game . she seems to have given up the ghost . they should have played in the rain , there 'd have been home advantage for watson . two more games to go for radwanska .
some great shots from both players in that game , but it 's williams who comes out on top as cornet slices her backhand in to the net .
vandeweghe puts in one of her best service games of the match , putting some decent power behind the ball . at 40-15 , sharapova tries to makes a rare trip into the net , but she gets the volley all wrong , handing the american the game . at the change of ends , vandeweghe is complaining amount sharapova moving during her ball toss again , and informs the umpire that `` if you do n't talk to her then i will , it 's not a problem . ''
wozniacki 's first ace of the match sees over the line .
pennetta appears to be caught in two minds now and it 's doing her game no good at all . she misses a routine backhand before standing too far behind the baseline to allow vinci to easily smash the ball out of her reach for two game points . pennetta starts to show a bit of aggression but it 's vinci 's game after a one-two off serve .
this is as good as ivanovic has played in some time . a crushing baseline winner is followed by two aces and although she loses a lengthy exchange on the next point , she holds to 15 for the third successive service game .
after conceding the opening point , pennetta finally shows a bit more authority by advancing into court to put away a smash , but she 's lucky to survive when vinci misses out with a forehand . vinci gets to deuce but another miscued forehand is her downfall before pennetta takes the game with a backhand winner into the open court . this final has n't really got going so far .
serena consolidates her break by holding to 15 .
clijsters somehow comes through ( again ! ) and we 're into another tie-break . the arthur ashe crowd are fully behind kim .
a strong response from the russian sees her comfortably take her service game . a series of fast serves from kirilenko causes problems for williams , who did n't seem prepared for so much power from her opponent .
aggression and quite magnificent hitting get the youngster out of deep trouble on serve . two wide serves are followed up by a precise volley at the net to force deuce , with bartoli biting right back to aim a fine forehand pass across court . more gutsy play at the net earns a tough hold for the 20-year-old .
break back ! watson produces some brilliant shots , which she desperately needs to , to give herself a 30-15 lead , but cirstea gets a lucky hit off the net chord to take the next point . however , it goes in watson 's favour in the next rally to give her her first break point of the match , and cirstea slices the ball into the net to let watson get the set back on serve . could this be the start of the comeback ?
that could be crucial ! what a game we have at the moment . both players are giving their all to take the initiative . twice sharapova goes ahead in the game , and took the score to 40-15 with a top-class forehand after reading jankovic 's moves well . she gave herself two break points , and finally managed to break jankovic after the latter hit her shot out . telling point of the match .
watson takes the opening point , but keys lets go with a stunning return of serve . however , watson maintains her composure with two superb serves out wide to bring up game point , and the first service-hold of the set is complete with a third .
a second-serve ace gets williams back to 15-15 after dropping the opening point , but a forehand into the net gives sharapova a look at 15-30. serena responds how a champion does , though , with three aggressive points to keep the pressure on the sharapova serve .
some mistakes are beginning to come from muguruza now , and two in a row allow radwanska to reach 0-30. like her previous service game , a serve out wide halves the deficit before radwanska wilts after another bombardment from the baseline . however , the pole earns her first break point of the match when her opponent nets , and it 's taken when the spaniard does the same off her backhand wing . that could be huge .
however , azarenka follows suit on her forehand and the russian breaks right back . brilliant response and she does n't seem to be too affected by the injury .
hampton breaks ! amazing scenes on rod laver . the crowd are absolutely loving it , while azarenka looks ready to burst .
vesnina finally starts to engage in rallies , using azarenka 's pace to return well off the serve . she makes it to deuce before a big forehand and an un-returned serve make it 4-0 .
another confident display from robson , who stays calm at 40-30 on second serve to grind out a crucial hold . kanepi still looks a tad tentative and stubbornly refuses to leave the baseline , with the first set still very much on serve .
the 19-year-old falls 0-15 behind , but she draws an encouraging response from the crowd with two points in a row , the second of which is a cross-court backhand winner . she brings up two game points when erakovic nets a first serve , and the brit is on the board when the new zealander goes long from the baseline .
williams starts the game with a double-fault to hand wozniacki 0-15 , but responds with a forehand passing shot . wozniacki then hits two forehands long of the baseline to hand williams 40-15 and the american holds with a sensational volley .
fantastic shot from cibulkova ! li is surely winning a point with a big forehand but an even quicker one comes back to force the error from her . the 20th seed then hits a lovely one-two to set up the game , before another double fault . not to worry for her , though , as she claims her third straight game to edge ahead in the match .
jankovic responds with a comprehensive hold to love . she needed that to get a foothold in the set .
what a start for the bulgarian ! she works a point nicely at advantage to slap a winner across court and take the break at the first time of asking . could there be an upset on the cards here ?
a good hold from hampton there . azarenka got in , but she kept her cool and finished the game off . still might to have enough to win this , but her forehand looks pretty tasty .
superb way to hold for the pole . she bends low to angle an in-to-out forehand near the line . li sprints across and gets it back but radwanska is at the net and puts away the volley .
make that 5-0 as williams holds to love again . we have been playing for just over 18 minutes . scary .
an unforced error lets li off the hook and she 's now one away from taking the win . it 's been a slog , and she still has to break remember .
sharapova records just her second ace to make it to 30-15 before serena goes long with a return . the russian then comes up with a forehand winner on the run and that 's a much better start to the set .
azarenka pulls off a lovely drop-shot to clinch the break . will that knock the fight out of ana ?
again errani does n't make the most of a smash opportunity , but goes on to win the point by staying at the net and finishing with the stop volley . what a backhand ! errani emphatically holds on to the break with a booming shot down the line - radwanska did n't move .
li is in complete control from the baseline to bring up deuce , before a drop shot forces a wide shot from vinci , giving the sixth seed a chance for another break . a poor shot to the net from the italian ensures that li takes the game .
stosur holds for a 1-0 lead . positive start from robson also . she produced a couple of winners which will have given her opponent something to ponder .
a love service game wraps up the first set for the fourth seed in just 28 minutes .
after that , makarova does indeed manage to hold to go 4-2 up . it was good to finally see some fight from the german .
the chinese manages to hold at the third attempt though with an assured forehand volley .
from the terrible to the brilliant from radwanska , who improvises a backhand smash to claim the break back at the first time of asking . a really interesting battle this , so far .
sharapova has made far too many double faults in this match , and she makes another at the start of this game , before some more stunning groundstrokes from vandeweghe bring up two break points for the unseeded american . sharapova saves the first with an ace down the centre line , before a long return from vandeweghe brings up deuce . vandeweghe gets another break point with an excellent return down the sideline though , before sharapova hits her forehand too low , handing the american the game . the deciding set is now back on serve !
ivanovic looks rejuvenated after reaching 0-30 thanks to a double fault and forehand winner , but she is desperately disappointed with a weak backhand into the net . safarova then produces a out-swinging first serve that is miscued by ivanovic before the serbian frames a backhand from the back of the court . safarova misses two chances to seal the game but on the third opening , ivanovic nets a forehand . she may rue that opportunity .
that 's how you want to serve for a set ! an ace out wide finishes it and we 're into a decider . pironkova has a problem with her foot and has called for the trainer - he or she has a long way to come , so there will be a short break .
williams looked to have started the game well , claiming the opening point with a superb back hand . but a series of excellent returns from the defending champion gave her two break points . the pair get into a lengthy rally , but the american fires her backhand wide , giving sharapova an early break . the russian has never defended a grand slam title , but she 's made the perfect start here .
she does it the hard way , but sharapova gets the hold to stay just one break behind azarenka .
too good from azarenka . she saves two break points before sealing the hold with a sweet forehand winner .
sharapova 's service game has gotten better throughout the game as bouchard ca n't return the first , while the canadian then produces a loose shot to hand the russian a 30-0 lead . another excellent serve does n't give bouchard a chance as the russian nails her shot with pinpoint accuracy before she seals the set as the 20-year-old 's sails long . the number two seed is closing in on victory .
these two are exchanging some mighty blows . stephens eventually wins through after a couple of deuces .
the nerves get to makarova at the start of the game as he makes a couple of poor mistakes to allow the halep a chance at breaking back like the first set . however , she manages to regroup to hit back at the romanian to take the game to deuce . a forehand winner earns halep a break point , but the 10th seed comes roaring back to win two straight points to take the game and surely now the match .
radwanska is n't being moved by the power of her opponent and she moves to 40-0 without response . keys managed to get one point in , but the polish star soon has everyone smiling with a crafty forehand winner .
well , well , well - i did n't see that coming . jankovic not only breaks straight back , but she does it empathetically to love . have to say breaks of serve have been extremely frequent in the women 's game during this tournament .
an easy hold in the first game of this match .
break back ! well , well . you 'd have thought that clijsters 's experience would mean that she would n't mimic robson in double-faulting on break point . nope , she does just that and we 're back level in the second .
thank you sian , and what a match this is turning into folks ! williams finds her first serve again as he moves 15-0 up , before she cracks an unbelievable backhand down the line . azarenka hits a superb return to get to 30-15 , but the top seed sees the game out with some big serving .
li is battling back . a double fault from the czech moves the chinese 15-40 up and she takes the break back at the first time of asking . not good serving from either player so far .
the points have been relatively short in this game as keys earns the first off an error from williams , and she continues to land her first serve in to put the pressure on the 33-year-old . williams earns a point back late in the game to apply some pressure , but keys produces an ace at the right moment to secure another important hold .
williams finally seems to have re-focused at the start of the game , as she gets it underway with an ace , before another powerful serve forces a wide shot from kuznetsova . the russian then returns her backhand to the net , but two long balls from the american , following some strong forehand shots from kuznetsova , get the world number 40 back in this game , before another long shot brings up deuce . williams finds the net while attempting a forehand to bring up a break point for kuznetsova , but a long return takes the game back to deuce . williams finds a big serve to take advantage , before a wide effort from the russian gives williams the game . she 'll be relieved to have held that after letting a 40-0 lead slip .
williams continues her improvement with a dominant hold to 15. as long as she keeps this up , she will believe that chances will arise on muguruza 's serve as she attempts to win her first set in a grand slam final .
match ! two kirilenko errors see sharapova move to within two points of the match , but kirilenko halves the deficit when sharapova goes long . however , the fifth seed produces a fantastic forehand winner down the line to bring up two match point and when kirilenko double faults , the 2006 winner can celebrate moving through to the second round .
a hold to love sees bartoli make her experience count to claim successive game since the resumption , winning six points in a row in the process . stephens is yet to get going since that rain delay and needs to find a hold desperately in her next service game .
the belarusian holds . massive game coming up for ivanovic . she needs to hold .
out of nothing , we have a break . stephens did well to recover and save two break points , but the third was put into the net by stephens and williams breaks at a good time . it was a simple upping of the ante and immediate success .
williams hits her first ace of the match with just her second serve , before azarenka catches the ball with the frame of her racquet . at 40-0 , azarenka can only slice the ball into the net on the return , handing williams a comfortable hold .
how 's that for your first game in a grand slam final ? vinci breezes to a hold to love but pennetta did n't look great in that game .
strong resolve there from the german . she serves it out after that slight wobble . just over half an hour that one took .
serena has hit eight aces and 16 winners so far . not bad , huh ? the world number one begins the second set with successive points to earn 0-30 but cibulkova responds with an ace . however , serena brings up two break points but a couple of confident points from her opponent take the game to deuce . that belief may have disappeared with two shots into the net though , and serena keeps up her momentum .
after the opening two points are shared , muguruza ca n't convert a difficult smash to concede 15-30 but she lucky with a net cord on a drive volley on the next point . muguruza reaches game point , but radwanska moves her around the court before converting a forehand winner . the spaniard eventually holds after catching the back of the line with a backhand , but it was anything but easy .
robson hits long and that could be curtains for the 18-year-old . you feel an instant break back is an absolute must .
again it is a strong start from kvitova as she moves 15-0 ahead when bouchard nets , before whipping another forehand past bouchard for 30-0. a smash at the net makes the score 40-0 and kvitova holds when bouchard nets once more . wow .
pressure volleying at the net puts vinci ahead on mladenovic 's serve , who responds by coming up strong with a whipped forehand into the corner to level the scores . more errors from the frenchwoman present vinci with break point , but she shows strength with neat placement to bring deuce . a stunning exchange at the net allows mladenovic to go ahead on advantage , with a hold being completing following an ace .
some fantastic shots from williams help her to a 30-0 advantage , but sharapova digs deep to get herself back in the game , but she hits her backhand into the net to give williams a break point , and the american takes the break when a sharapova forehand goes long on the next point . the pressure seems to be getting to the russian at the moment .
at the second time of asking in the game , li nets and the czech player breaks , and has her nose in front again .
vandeweghe looks like she 's made a good start as she watches sharapova return her first serve long , before stepping into the baseline to hit a forehand to the back corner . the american tries one too many attempts to get into the net though , allowing sharapova to lob the ball over her opponent . vandeweghe goes for an overhead smash , but takes it a touch too late and hits it into the net , giving sharapova a chance to get an early break on the board , but the russian 's return is long . at deuce , a long forehand from vandeweghe gives the fourth seed another chance , and she takes this one as vandeweghe hits the ball into the net .
ivanovic tries her best to attack the bouchard serve but the canadian 's defence is just too good and she moves within one game of the first set .
a closely-fought game sees the score head to deuce . li gives azarenka a break point after getting her backhand caught at the net , before sending a shot long on the next point to drop her serve at the start of the second set .
no real threat from bouchard on the ivanovic serve since that initial break . the canadian does n't need to break though , it 's ivanovic who needs to step it up when receiving .
terrific attacking play at the net from kvitova sees the eighth seed claim her fourth successive game and start the second set on a positive note . makarova has just been a step behind since we restarted on court one , but has a chance to build confidence now back on serve .
cibulkova finds the line with a risky forehand , but she has less luck when going for too much on the next point . serena is almost too relaxed when attempting a drop shot - it barely reaches the net - and she lets out a shriek after the next rally after missing an easy forehand . cibulkova holds to 15 to at least stay competitive in this match , but it 's a long , long way back against a player that she has never beaten in four attempts .
more fight from wozniacki but her efforts amount to little , with cetkovsa smashing a forehand winner across court for to consolidate her break . you feel that the dane simply had to maximise that opportunity to break , but the ninth seed looks unable to compete in lengthy rallies on that swollen ankle .
break : great fightback by azarenka , who forces the game to deuce with some ultra-agressive hitting . however , the belarusian then makes two sloppy errors to hand the game to sharapova .
li wraps up her best service hold of the game , and that was an important one too to stop the rot of games against her . can she get back into her opponent 's serve now ?
we 're seeing more rallies now , which is to be as expected with these two . errani battles from 40-15 down to within a shot of deuce , but she fluffs a high smash into the tramlines to give radwanska the game .
a solid service game from sharapova , she 's running away with this set at the moment
we 're starting to see a much more animated williams as she punches the air in delight after a brilliant forehand winner off the serve early in the game . another winner follows to put the pressure on muguruza , who hands her rival two break points with a wild forehand . it 's another error which hands the game to williams . is there any stopping the world number one now ?
the first is saved with a fine controlled smash , before radwanska goes long on the second . there 's no mistake with the third , though , with a stunning backhand winner down the line . first blood radwanska .
double break ! dear me , what a nightmare afternoon it 's turning out to be for lisicki . she 's broken again and bartoli wo n't believe her luck . yes , she 's handled the pressure better but has n't had to come up against much today .
cirstea is barely tested as she cruises to another hold of serve , finishing the game with back-to-back aces . it still looks like both players are easing themselves into this tie , with neither really pushing for an early break .
my word . after taking the opening point , williams double faults ... twice in a row . vinci should have two break points but she misses a backhand volley at the net . such a let off for williams . the american makes it to game point , but it 's her turn to make a blunder on a backhand volley . williams gets a second game point with an ace registering 126mph but vinci 's response is insane ! she completes a 20-shot rally with the deftest of volleys and puts her hand to her ear to address the new york crowd . brave ! what a point though . vinci has the momentum and she breaks through when williams goes long with a forehand !
azarenka is starting to look much stronger in this second set than in the previous one . some devastating returns from the world number one are too much for li to control , giving azarenka break point . another strong return from the belarusian sees li 's reply fly long .
these two are blowing hot and cold at the moment . just as cornet looked like she may be crumbling , a series of double faults by williams gives her a chance to break and she takes it . this set looks like it will be won by whichever player makes the fewest errors .
break back ! radwanska picks up the pace in the next rally and looks like she 's going to bring it back to deuce but lisicki earns the break with a stunning crosscourt forehand .
the decibel level of sharapova 's shrieks is getting higher by the point and the number five seed produces two forehand winners that fly past her opponent . kirilenko then slices wide to get sharapova three break-back points , but the first is saved with a well-directed forehand out wide . she ca n't save a second , though , and sharapova is back on level terms after kirilenko goes wide .
kvitova takes the first point , but two unforced errors hand doi a chance at 15-30. the czech left-hander then nets to hand doi two break points , but kvitova shows fine defensive play to get back to deuce . an ace then brings up set point , before a thunderous forehand is too hot to handle for doi .
the american keeps her cool and keeps her nose in front . work to be done for vika .
well i was n't expecting that i have to say ! sharapova starts sluggishly again , allowing bartoli to go an early break up .
williams screams to the heavens after finally hitting her target with a first serve before she advances to 30-0 with a backhand winner . safarova halves the deficit with a winner of her own but williams level with first serve and an ace . she 's back ... maybe .
a series of well-constructed points earn makarova a hold to love . no signs of nerves on court one from the world number 27 , who uses a strong left-handed backhand to finish things off at the baseline . kvitova has been slow to start often this season and will need to find her intensity quickly to progress .
some solid serving , along with a couple of unforced errors from robson gives wozniacki a commanding first-set lead .
well , well . she may have been thrashed during the opening set , but stosur is a break up early in the second . a sign of tension from azarenka perhaps ?
a huge serve finishes another comfortable service game . although stephens did manage one point from it . she 's already done better than most players can hope to against the powerhouse that is wiliams .
it 's a shaky start for the young brit . two double faults and two unforced errors give kvitova an easy break .
ivanovic is getting twitchy on serve and starts the 11th game of this match with a double fault . a second follows to give safarova a look at 15-30 and it 's more two break points for safarova after the serbian blasts the ball into the net . safarova is all over the next return and just like that , she will serve for the first set .
williams finds some fight as she hits a series of stunning forehand winners to bring up two break points . she gives herself a talking to before preparing to take the first , but it does n't work , as some brilliantly-timed strokes from the back of the court from kuznetsova bring up deuce . williams gets another chance to break as she flicks a backhand volley past the russian , and wins the game when the russian hits her forehand into the net .
break back ! neither woman looks particularly confident on serve at the moment as azarenka double-faults for a third and then fourth time to gift ivanovic the break back .
azarenka breaks : i said earlier that hantuchova 's serve can often be a tough nut to crack - not on this occasion ! solid and composed hitting from the belarusian is enough to break to love , as her opponent makes four forced errors .
williams is really going for the power on her forehand early on in this match , but she twice overhits the ball , before landing one perfectly on the sideline , which the belarusian can only slot into the net as she stretches to reach it . williams gets another point back , but azarenka comes into the net for a volley , which the world number one can only scuff into the net .
keys feels the heat from the russian as she commits two unforced errors when she serves to stay in the set . her serve returns at just the right moment with two powerful efforts down the 't ' to tie the game at 30-30. however , keys then commits a double fault to hand radwanska a set point , but she hits back with a well-played point before hitting a cross-court winner on her forehand . the pole carves out two further set points , but a wide backhand and a sublime sliced volley at the net from keys keep peg the game back to deuce . the 20-year-old sends the set to a tie-breaker by sealing the final two points with solid forehands .
she does indeed get one on the board and she forces radwanska to serve for the match . that 's all you can ask for at this stage of the contest .
sheer power from sharapova as she bludgeons a forehand across the court to secure the a 15-0 lead , but makarova matches her stroke for stroke on the second point to level the game . the 2008 champion double faults twice in a row to gift two break points to makarova , who misses by centimetres on an attempted forehand winner down the line to cost herself one , while sharapova brings about deuce with an ace . the 10th seed misses twice in a row with forehands down the line as sharapova claims the hold and will have a chance to break for the match .
safarova needs to put that previous game to the back of her mind and she appears to have done just that with a blistering return winner . she moves to 15-30 but what a remarkable response from ivanovic , who crushes a backhand winner into the corner . it 's equally as good from safarova though , and after driving a huge forehand down the line , she takes the break point when ivanovic goes wide . safarova 's going to serve for a place in the final for a second time !
very good from ivanovic . she 's winning the majority of rallies over a few shots and it looking very quick on the floor so far .
break : a third consecutive unforced error sees azarenka forfeit game seven . the belarusian has handed in her notice . this should be over very shortly .
williams takes the first set as she fires an ace down the 't ' which keys can only guide out . an excellent tie-breaker from both players .
li hangs on after deuce and radwanska now to serve to take this into a breaker .
kirilenko tries to catch williams out with a slow , low volley , but it 's too low and does n't clear the net , allowing williams an easy hold , and the american is just one game from taking the first set .
williams begins a must-win game with a cross-court forehand winner , but she misses a gim me of a backhand - it 's an absolute shocker . it 's 15-15 , but williams strikes back with a return winner . she proceeds to over-hit a backhand to move the game along to 30-30 , but an error from vinci gives her a chance to break back . vinci finds the one-two though - it 's superb . williams then nets a return and it 's set point to vinci , who takes it by getting williams on the run who proceeds to go long . we have a game on here !
perfect response from sharapova as she serves out to love . the dark clouds are descending though . whoever is going to win this will have to be quick !
break : sharapova extends her winning streak to three games , as azarenka 's cross-court forehand clips the top of the net and drifts wide .
a confident start from the american to take the first point , but azarenka comes back to take the next four points to hold serve .
two returns from keys fail to hit their intended target to see venus move two points from the set but she remains active when venus goes long . however , two set points are created when keys hits a wayward forehand , and it 's sealed on the first with an ace down the middle .
serena does indeed hold , and that was important . it will give her belief , but the injury has made her a much less attacking player now .
vandeweghe looks to the net again , picking up the opening point with a volley , before landing a cross-court backhand on the sideline after a baseline rally . she misses a forehand on the next point to keep sharapova in the game , but the russian slices her return wide to let vandeweghe on the board in this third set .
venus comes to the net again , taking pace off the ball with the volley . 30-30 .
kvitova offers nothing at the start of the game , and after falling 0-30 behind , she dumps a forehand into the net to gift doi three set points . but the japanese player ca n't take any of them , going for too much at the wrong point in the rally on each occasion . she earns a fourth break opportunity , but again , kvitova stays strong , and eventually forces doi to serve for the set .
that is just what the doctor ordered in this situation . robson holds with ease .
lisicki makes her first double fault of the match , but makes amends with a well-timed drop shot , before smashing a forehand winner past kanepi . the german tries another drop shot , but this time kanepi get the ball back , but lisicki is able to tap the ball into the open court . a big serve from the 23rd seed is smashed into the net by the estonian , giving lisicki the game .
sheer relief from kviotva has she wins her first game in nine attempts . the eighth seed is quick to ask about the light after that success , and encouraged by her coach looks desperate to get off court .
the serb ends the game with a winners off both wings . impressive stuff and a confidence-boosting hold to start for the underdog .
easily the most comfortable service game of the match so far for sharapova . she 's still struggling with her first serve , having got just 46 % of them in so far , but her placement on second serve forces a series of errors from williams , allowing the russian a comfortable hold .
kuznetsova rises to the challenge and now the pressure is all on wozniacki .
wozniacki holds . she puts herself within a game of victory , with kuznetsova serving to stay in the match .

the american has wasted no time in finding accuracy with her first serve , earning a second hold to love in the process under little pressure .

laura robson wins !
well under pressure you have to say stephens has buckled there . at 0-40 down she goes too bold on second serve , crashing a double fault well past its intended target . make that seven successive breaks now , which apart from a confused scoreboard mean that bartoli will now serve for the match .
that five-minute seeing to by the trainer seems to have rejuvenated radwanska as she moves to 0-40 before converting her second break point with an up-the-line winner .
superb anticipation at the net from kanepi gets her service game off to a strong start , with a fierce first serve quickly building a 40-0 lead . a strong backhand return from robson reduces the deficit , but kanepi takes advantage of a slip from the brit to hold serve .

mladenovic opens up the decider , then . vinci can not find her feet as her opponent goes 30-15 ahead , though the italian is given a chance following some more french mistakes . a crunching forehand moves mladenovic back into a game-winning position and she seals it by opening up across court with her backhand .
a great response from robson , as kvitova also struggles with her opening service game . two double faults from kvitova helped robson to a break point , before the czech caught the ball on the net to hand her break back .
first set to robson ! the world number 38 races into a 40-0 lead , but wastes her first two set points , making the crowd on court number one nervy . that nervousness quickly becomes joy , as robson cracks a huge serve down the middle , which her opponent deflects well wide .
williams gets into position for two routine put-aways but she misses both , much to her frustration . it gives bacsinszky the momentum to come through with a love hold of her own .
two aces and a big first serve in a row take williams to three game points , which is sealed with another booming first delivery down the middle . the last six points have been as good as it gets .
mladenovic continues well back on her own serve and a lucky net point sets up the game . the 22-year-old takes it when vinci comes up short on the forehand .
bartoli 's composed volley , followed by an unreturned serve sees her consolidate the break .
after a 13th return winner , lisicki again misfires with a groundstroke to hand radwanska the hold . can she steady herself on serve now ?
break : another double fault from sharapova . total capitulation from the russian .
or maybe not .. once again kerber 's serve fails her and makarova breaks back . there have been as many breaks as holds in this one i reckon , no-one seems to want to go a set up .
azarenka serves her fourth double fault of the set and stephens takes full advantage . well , azarenka implodes , goes wide with the forehand and the american has broken back . she 's keeping herself in this one .
this is the biggest game of safarova 's career . how will she handle it ? it 's not a great start as she commits a double fault before she sprays a routine forehand wide of the target . safarova risks a 141kmph second serve and it pays off to halve the deficit before she wrong-foots the serbian with a forehand for 30-30. however , a double fault hands ivanovic a break point but the former world number one drills a forehand return off a second serve into the net . it 's a shocker . safarova creates a match point after prevailing from a lengthy baseline rally but it 's followed by her third double fault of the game ! she then misses with a backhand inside the court to hand another break point to ivanovic but again , she nets a potential winner ! what drama . a third break point is created with a stunning forehand down the line but safarova saves it with a smash . this is incredible stuff . ivanovic is relishing this far more than safarova and she over-powers her opponent to bring up a fourth opening for the break and on this occasion , she takes it when safarova catches the net to help the ball go wide .
momentum shift ? safarova pulls off the shot of the final with a heavily-sliced backhand from the baseline that gets the better of her opponent before two game points are created when she outlasts williams in a rally . that 's followed by a big first serve that is fired out and the czech is back to within one game .
venus seems undecided whether to attack keys or make her work for every point and it 's not helping her cause . however , despite falling 40-15 behind , she hangs tough with her opponent to get to deuce , and that 's enough to heap enough pressure on keys to secure the break of serve when the 19-year-old blazes long .
she blows it again by putting a backhand into the tramlines . from that point there was only likely to be one winner of the game , and sharapova holds - marginally , once more - to move just one away from the first set .
madison keys beats heather watson
not the best start for vinci as she opens up with a double fault . almost comical next up from mladenovic who bangs one into the stands . vinci is soon back on her game with an ace , which is followed by crushing forehand across the court . her french opponent responds with a wonderful cut down the line , but concedes the game when she produces an error on the backhand .
williams seems to just be cruising towards the second round , knowing that she just needs to do enough on her own serve to seal the win . the american has one of her most comfortable service games of the match , allowing lim just a point as she keeps her forehand tidy .
watson starts this game much better , forcing keys into two errors on the opening three points , but she then gifts the american parity when she nets from the baseline . however , the brit earns her first break point after another keys mistake , but the american thunders down a first serve that watson sends wide . a double fault gives watson another chance , but a stunning ace saves it , and keys eventually sees out the game . that was more encouraging from watson .
the belarusian breaks straight back . it could be 'one of them matches ' . the ones where service holds are like breaks .
lim has to stay well behind to baseline to give herself time to react to williams 's forehands , but she gets a lucky strike on the net chord to give her advantage before williams 's backhand crept just wide to allow lim to hold .
eventually radwanska holds after seven deuces and 13 minutes . much-needed drinks after that .
a couple of brilliant forehands from kvitova and a lucky hit of the net chord help the czech to another break .
good power from jankovic on a couple of occasions in that game . she displays her trademark backhand and even a forehand cross-court to take a good hold .
a bad start to the game from bouchard as he produces an unforced error for the 23rd time in the game , but she bounces back with a solid rally to earn the point after working sharapova over in the middle of the court . the players exchange winners on alternate points , but sharapova has the break point only for bouchard to produce a brilliant drop shot . the canadian uses all her ability to dig out another point with a superb backhand winner , but follows that up with a carelees loose shot into the net . however , two uncharacteristic errors from sharapova hand bouchard the crucial hold as she drills her backhand into the net .
aided by three unforced errors from her opponent , knapp holds to 30. sharapova must now serve from the sunny end . can she finally close out ? let 's find out ...
a dreadful game from williams sees hantuchova hold to 15. i apologise to anyone who took notice of my prediction and bet on serena to win the game handicap . the only way that can happen now is if hantuchova wins this set in a tie-break and then loses the decider 6-0. you never know ...
we are a witnessing the trademark williams lull right now . all of a sudden , she looks completely de-energised and frustrated . she takes the opening point with a forehand winner but the rest of the game belongs to vinci .
kirilenko is gifted the opening point as robson fires long with an ultra-aggressive forehand . however , the british number one quickly finds her range and , courtesy of some very clean hitting , holds comfortably to 15 .
back on service , vinci takes control with a mixed bag of shots to unsettle mladenovic at 30-15. however , mladenovic comes straight back with a crushing forehand down the line at 30-30. another beautiful forehand from the youngster brings about break point , but she can not take it with a lowly cut into the net . more inconsistency from mladenovic gives vinci hope , and she holds out with a brilliant serve and volley . another big moment , for sure !

really strong fightback from li , but she owes a lot to a really poor attempt at a drop shot from the czech . this set is heading towards a bagel .
williams has still got enough about her to trouble stephens , but really the youngster is missing too many shots . that said , she recovers from break point down to hold after some good net play .
nothing at all wrong with her serve , though . she holds to 15 and looked very comfortable .

it looks like it 's going to be an easy hold for the italian as she opens up a 40-15 lead , but kvitova fights back with a pair of winners to the back of the court . the czech misses a backhand while looking for the break point though , and looks rather flat-footed as she makes another error on the backhand to give the italian the game . despite the weather that 's due overnight , it 's still a hot day in new york , and it looks like kvitova was feeling the heat a bit towards the end of that game .
it 's a comfortable start to the match for the world number one as she opens the first set with some big serves . the 26th seed has little answer to williams 's sheer power .
an impressive hold to love puts radwanska firmly in the driving seat early on . important for ivanovic to put a game on the board and try to establish herself in the match now .

and there it is , azarenka breaks straight back . the crowd hardly clap . they 're right behind hampton in this one !
the serving from williams is of the highest quality as she does n't give keys a chance to hit back at her as all four of the shots are on the money , including two aces in a love game . there were four shots played in that game , all by williams . she is playing at an extremely high level now .
too easy for sharapova on her serve now . you wonder looking at makarova playing her opponent 's serve how she managed a break in the first set . sharapova finishes this particular game with a low driven forehand that somehow clips the line .
azarenka using her experience now . stephens does fight back really well but the belarusian grabs another break and puts another nail in the stephens coffin .
muguruza is still fighting , but williams is finding the right areas with the best shots now . a gripping exchanges at 30-15 ends with the world number one coming forward to hit the backhand winner . muguruza then finds the net to give her rival a break point . the first chance is wasted , but a forehand winner off the second serve earns williams another opportunity . ace ! much better from muguruza , but she opens the door to williams again with a backhand into the net . williams finally takes the gift when a forehand from muguruza drifts long . she 'll now serve for the match .

much more accurate from li . not just with her serve but her shots from the baseline were finding the target , which helped her to a strong and important hold early in the set .
and she takes it ! serena looks deflated as she hits a backhand wide to concede the service break . what effect will that have on this final ? azarenka will be in firm control if she consolidates with a hold .
assured start from williams , as she holds to 15. the american must have covered all of three feet in that game ... sheer power !
match ! vinci begins a must-win service game with a shocker of a forehand into the tramlines before pennetta moves two points away with a stunning backhand winner . vinci looks to have half given up with an extremely poor lob that is given the treatment by pennetta for three match points and pennetta takes it with a forehand winner that catches the line !
sharapova 's run of six successive games comes to an end , but makarova has to find a break from somewhere if she 's to stay in this match .

radwanska looks to impose herself early on and she forces keys into two errors , but the american soon hits back with a forehand winner . keys seeks to push radwanska a little harder and she wins out as her polish opponent makes a mistake trying to return on the forehand as the ball flies out of the court . two more errors from radwanska give keys the break point , and she takes it when radwanska fails on the backhand .
stephens holds with an ace at just the right time . she pumps her fist and lets out a little scream . she knows that robson is on the warpath .
williams gets on the attack early on , coming into the net to pounce on a volley , but she gives the ball too much power on the next point , firing her forehand long again . kuznetsova has not such problems with her forehand , as she sends the ball down the line . williams appeared to twist her ankle , and is unable to make a return again the next serve , giving kuznetsova the game . williams has n't called for the trainer though , so she seems ok to continue .

after those nightmare service games to start , both women have now held serve . li does so with a big up-the-line backhand at advantage .
under the impression that keys is all about power ? think again . she glides into the net to put away the deftest of volleys before venus throws in a double fault to give her opponent 0-30. it 's all keys now and she brings up three set points when venus sends a backhand into the net . she wastes no time in moving into a one-set lead with a bludgeoning forehand return and venus has it all to do here .
eventually it 's a hold for kvitova but she did n't make it look easy . robson has had eight break points against kvitova in the last two service games from the czech , but has failed to take any of her chances .
a much-needed hold for jankovic at the start of the second set . a break next would be nice , if not a little a greedy !

there 's that dodgy bit of court again as pironkova slips . she 's ok , but lost her advantage and radwanska follows it up with advantage of her own and then a volley for the game . so the bulgarian has to serve this one out , then .

williams breaks ! she treats the italian 's second serve with complete and utter contempt , as she swats it back onto the baseline with plenty of interest .

sharapova breaks back ! losing that service game made sharapova angry and she channels her anger into two massive forehand winners to move 0-30 ahead , before breaking to love .

after that , though , it 's a comfortable hold for the pole , who confirms the break .
it 's too good from radwanska , who runs pironkova all over the court before hitting the forehand winner to consolidate the break . i ca n't see the bulgarian getting back into this now .
williams finally meets some resistance on her serve , but she holds safely to take the opener 6-3. just 28 minutes that took .
the german does manage to hold serve though as serena uncharacteristically dumps a pair of backhand returns into the net .
keys is absolutely leathering the ball now and venus is having to work hard to stay in each point . at 15-15 , keys is all over a venus second serve and she repeats the feat on the next point . she has two break points for a level game , and for a third point in succession , the return gets the job done . remarkable stuff . she has won 12 of the last 15 points .
there it is at the first time of asking . that is surely the crucial break in this first set , and now she just needs to hold . i say just ... she 's been far too inconsistent up to now for this to be a dead cert .
good stuff from halep , who comes through with the love hold . pennetta gifted her a couple of points though , especially the last point where a drive volley was fired into the net .

well that did n't last long ! stosur looked to be in command at 40-15 in front , but azarenka fought back to level up the score . a big opportunity squandered by stosur .
azarenka tries a drop shot , but it 's poorly executed and gives li two break points . she saves the first but a forehand on the next point goes long . the defending champion challenges , but it was a good couple of inches out . the break means it 's back on serve in the second set .
it 's a sensational response from bacsinszky who brings up two break-back points but williams shows the resilience of a champion by connecting with an ace and backhand conversion at the net to hold onto her serve . big moment .

sharapova finds some of her strongest serving of the match to force some incredible defensive play from williams , but the russian is too strong from the baseline , wrapping up the game by forcing a mis-hit from the american . that was sharapova 's strongest game of this second set , but she 'll need to keep that up against the williams serve next if she 's to get back into the match .
azarenka breaks : the opening set appears to be getting away from hantuchova , who is broken to love for the second time tonight . azarenka is starting to find her form , hitting three winners in game seven . she will now serve for a one-set lead .
brutal from williams , who steps in to fire a backhand straight back at her opponent , but have nerves started to set in ? williams double-faults , before sending a routine baseline shot over the mark . she then does the same with a backhand and it 's two break points for azarenka ! a forehand winner saves the first , but she dumps another shot long of the baseline . we are back on level terms in this set !

the short break seems to have done the russian good . she wins her serve without much resistance from the german .
a strong effort there from bartoli to get the opening hold , showing power and depth to force errors in successive baseline rallies . that is what the 28-year-old has based her success on at sw19 in recent years , grinding out tough points deep at the back of the court .
she makes no mistake this time ! immediately sharapova dominates the point from the baseline , goes deep into the corner to set up an easy winner . this set is almost over .
sharapova fights back to move ahead in the game but a thumping return brings us to another deuce . it 's again point for point , with sharapova saving a few break points but is powerless to stop a li forehand to net . li will serve for the first set .

consecutive errors from both players leave the scores at 30-30 on bacsinszky 's serve . the switzerland star pulls out in front as she forces muguruza into a forehand error with a swipe into the net . bacsinszky serves well and her opponent 's return has too much on it as it flies beyond the baseline .
after failing to win the double-break , this is an important game for doi , but two quick points see her move 30-0 ahead . kvitova then goes long off a return , but keeps in the game after doi nets . however , the czech player has completely lost her range , and doi moves one away from leveling the match after kvitova puts too much on a forehand .

vinci comes good with wonderful strike down the line , but it is not good enough to stop mladenovic who eventually closes out another hold when vinci fails on the forehand .
the azarenka challenge starts to fade at the start of the game as two errors open the door to halep , who is powerless to prevent the belarusian from hitting back with a volley after moving her from side to side . halep 's forehand then goes long , before azarenka moves to game point with a fantastic backhand winner . great response from the former world number one . she wraps up the game to ensure that halep must finish the job on her serve .
a couple of superb returns from cirstea put the brit under pressure , but a stunning forehand down the sideline from watson pulls the game back to 30-30. cirstea commands a lengthy rally from the baseline on the next point though to bring up the first break point of the match , and the brit gives the game away with a double fault . she 'll be disappointed with that game .
the disappointment of missing out on the break points appears to be playing on cirstea 's mind at the start of the game as she serves a double fault , before dragging her forehand wide . the romanian goes for a volley , but it 's slightly too high , and she gets a poor contact with the ball , giving williams three break points , and another ball to the net gifts the american the break .
kvitova also finds confidence with her serve , and takes an easy hold against her teenage opponent .
sure enough , li takes it . that was definitely a forgettable set of tennis - despite it lasting more than an hour - with 25 and 20 unforced errors respectively .
so far , kirilenko does n't look fazed by the challenge in front of her , but sharapova holds in far more comfortable fashion than the first . both players have started well .
the kazakhstani does really well to pull level for deuce , but then mishits a return , before hitting the next shot into the net and venus is strolling .
we 've had 10 breaks of serve in this match so far and we are soon on our way to an 11th when keys lashes the ball around the court before sealing two points with winners . venus finds a way back to 30-30 but another dominant point creates the break point . venus throws down a second serve and it 's enough to give the advantage to keys , who thunders down a forehand winner . it 's getting to a tense time now !
brilliant . williams does n't give muguruza a chance of staying in the set . three aces and an unreturned serve down the middle bring the world number one level . we 're heading into a deciding set . what a match .
another hold from knapp - this time to 30 .
halep wins the first point in the game as makarova finds the net for the first time in the match , but another error from the number 23-year-old brings the russian level . good tennis from halep edges her ahead again , but back-to-back double faults hand makarova another break point . halep shows further signs of her nerves as she miscues a smash after putting the 10th seed on the back foot to fall 3-0 behind in the set .
that 's delightful . sharapova hits a perfectly-executed topspin lob that drops in and brings up the hold . lovely stuff .
serena hits long and is broken to love ! azarenka is now just two games away from her second grand slam title .
what a start from safarova , who sets up a baseline winner after an incredible return of serve . serena responds with an ace and she should be 15-30 down , but her opponent misses a sitter of a forehand . she could rue that ! williams is two points away from the title , and it stays that way after safarova unleashes a monster of a forehand down the line . it 's 30-30. will it be match point or break point ? it 's break point ! serena nets and gives the czech a chance to break back , which she does with a stunning backhand down the line . incredible stuff .

break back ! this time she takes it with a magnificent topspin backhand lob ! what a shot ! the crowd are right on her side now !

a dipping forehand from robson hits the line and stephens mistimes her shot , firing into the net . robson holds crucially .
and she has responded positively , although radwanska made her work extremely hard there . the pole took the game all the way to deuce .
bacsinszky shakes off the disappointment of losing that set by taking the first two points of the third set , but the american replies with two venomous winners to get back to 30-30. bacsinszky should win the next point but she goes for too much on a simple forehand and this is serena 's chance to break . unbelievably , bacsinszky misses another sitter on her forehand and she is broken . it 's a terrible way to lose serve .
break back ! this is great ! it 's three breaks of serve in a row as lisicki manages it on the second . serena came to the net but it was a weak approach and lisicki hit a pass that serena could n't get down to .
it 's a bit scrappy from both players and there are n't many rallies happening . kerber holds to 30. three holds of serve in a row , that seemed unlikely at the end of the last set .
another comfortable hold for williams .
i have to say the romanian does n't look much good . azarenka is playing well , mind , but i reckon this one could be over very quickly . that 's not very profound , i know , as she 's 4-0 up in the first .
pennetta finds her range off the ground to move to 30-15 but halep is the beneficiary of a lucky net cord to get to 30-30. the pair trade winners to get to deuce , but halep looks the more confident on the next points . she is crushing everything and her opponent comes up with the error . what a turnaround . high-quality match .
good start to the set from azarenka , who picks up where she left off with powerful groundstrokes . williams ca n't cope right now , and azarenka comfortably holds .
deft from vinci ! the italian sees mladenovic charging so instead she scoops across the court to catch her cold , before the frenchwoman does exactly the same to the italian on the next play . vinci eventually powers through to hold when mladenovic 's backhand is wayward twice in a row .

more confident serving sees stephens crash a second ace down the middle , before a clever wide serve soon makes it ace number three . bartoli just caught on her heels there deep at the baseline , allowing the american to quickly claim a love service game of her own .
kanepi is really struggling now , making some poor shot selections , allowing lisicki to blast a couple of easy winners past her , before two careless shots to the net allow lisicki to break . it 's difficult to see the estonian getting back into this now .
kvitova misses her opening serve but manages a second-serve ace , before following with a fairly solid performance to take the game . how long can they keep this up ? !
safarova takes the opening point with more aggressive play and she moves a mini-break ahead after a double fault from williams - her seventh of the match . it 's 3-0 to safarova after a backhand finds the net but serena hangs tough in the next point to force the mistake from the left-hander . safarova re-opens her three-point advantage when williams sends a backhand return wide of the line but williams reaches the chance of ends at 4-2 with a huge first serve .
robson breaks ! the teenager converts with a wonderful combination play . she manoeuvres kirilenko out of position with a precise backhand and then ends the point with a ruthless forehand winner .

serena continues her dominance on her serve as he nails an ace to earn her first point of the game , and keys ca n't keep the rallies going as well as she would wanted as she fires two strokes into the net . another error soon follows from the 19-year-old to give the number one seed a relatively easy hold . williams has the chance to force a break to secure the set .
gotcha ! fantastic start from robson , whose powerful shot to the baseline causes stosur no end of problems . the aussie gets her racket to the ball , but it 's high and wide . a hold from the brit now and she is in business .
three more commanding points takes sharapova to the brink of the game , but a double fault gives kirilenko a temporary reprieve . there 's still no sign of kirilenko wilting to any degree and she wins a lengthy rally with a cross-court forehand . kirilenko manages to get back to deuce , but she does n't have enough to stop her opponent moving to within one game of the second round .
muguruza has risen to every challenge so far , but a double fault puts her in some trouble at 0-30. there 's only one way to hit back . a fast unreturned serve . williams responds well to come forward and find two break points with a forehand winner . muguruza hits the net , and williams will now serve for the second set .
oh wow . ivanovic plays the perfect point before dumping the easiest of backhand volleys into the net . that 's going to do her confidence no good at all . safarova moves to 30-0 with a big forehand winner before three set points are created with an ace down the middle . the czech only needs the one as ivanovic sends a return long .
frightening hitting from azarenka ! she holds to draw level in the second set .
the british number one comes out on top in a couple of longer rallies before a powerful forehand down the line brings her to game-point . a long backhand and yet another double-fault turn the game on it 's head , but robson eventually saves the game , putting away a short ball with her forehand .
williams is having to fight for every point at the moment as lim has n't given up on this set . the french player makes her opponent run the length of the baseline before the world number one fires wide , but williams kept her cool to find a big serve , which lim returned long .
robson holds despite some good returning from kvitova . the czech has been screeching every time she won a point , while hanging her head at every miss , she 's really letting her emotions show . robson , meanwhile , looks fairly calm .
serena still has the cough that she has been carrying all week but it does n't stop another two aces and one unreturned serve helping her to a 40-0 lead . cibulkova gets on the board but only briefly after striking a second-serve return out of the court .
brilliant stuff from the american . a stunning forehand lands just on the line to give her a 30-0 lead . two big serves from kirilenko level the game before a long forehand hands williams a break point , and she converts it when the russian sends the ball long again .
a double fault and a couple of mis-hit forehands from li give azarenka two break points . it looks like li has saved the first when azarenka fires the ball long , but a challenge reveals it was in . the reigning champion is unhappy that she is n't awarded the point , but the crowd , who are still firmly behind li , boo as she argues with the umpire and she lets it go , before playing a brilliant volley to take the game on the next point .
williams begins with an ace of her own , before a cross-court forehand finds the line . a massive serve down the middle is too hot to handle for the teenager , before williams converts a volley into the open court for a love-service hold . barty is struggling a little with her footing at the moment .
intelligent play from robson , who wrong-foots her opponent on the opening point , who then double faults once more and the brit is two points away from the fourth round . that 's a fine response from the new zealander , who puts away a neat volley at the net , which is followed up with her 12th ace for 30-30. it 's match point to robson after a return just clears the net , but she ca n't convert off a solid serve from erakovic . so close from the 19-year-old , who misses the tramline by an inch , and erakovic saves the match with a serve out wide .
both players trade winners on the opening two points before muguruza registers her first ace . however , serena is warming into this now and a smash helps her reach deuce . the spaniard holds on though when serena makes a couple of mistakes .
hmm , that was an odd service game from vinci - she comes up short on every third ball to hand a break straight back to mladenovic .
it is a quick hold for wozniacki . she 's taking full advantage of kuznetsova 's lapse in concentration . the russian has not made many more unforced errors in this set , but the ones she has made have come on crucial points . wozniacki will be looking for the 'insurance break ' now .
that 's not the start to the second set that radwanska wanted . muguruza powers her way to 0-40 , and although radwanska provides a response , the spaniard 's backhand proves too hot to handle . she could run away with this match from here .
she 's a clever one , is radwanska . she closes out the game by drawing li into the net and swiping away the volley that is presented to her .
that is as good a backhand winner as you 're likely to see for the next fortnight ! sharapova catches it on the half-volley and although her opponent is well placed it flies past her for 1-1 .
kvitova finally seems to have put her struggles on serve behind her and is making robson pay . the brit is finding it difficult to make good returns against some sensation serves from the eighth seed .
two great shots from sharapova hand her control of the game as she races into a 30-0 lead , but an error from the 2008 champion brings makarova into the game as she crashes a forehand into the net . however , an ace and a powerful forehand stroke secure the game and an overwhelming advantage in the first set . makarova needs to work very hard to get back into this one .
it is becoming increasingly evident that kvitova is struggling a bit with her game , and doi coasts into a 40-0 advantage , before the japanese player converts an easy forehand put-away at the net to remain ahead in the set .
venus finally has some success against the injured keys to open up a 0-30 lead . the 19-year-old replies with an ace but on the next point , the 18th seed works keys around the court before the error comes . keys shows tremendous guts to get back to deuce but venus has worked out that she is struggling on the backhand side and that 's enough to get back in front . the trainer is back out , and if keys loses this set , i 'd say there is a chance she may pull out , but we will see .
robson breaks ! kirilenko hits her way back to deuce . however , crouching down , she then pats a backhand into the net to give robson another break point , which is converted with a wicked forehand return .
cirstea is struggling early in this match . williams claims the opening two points with some big forehands . the romanian gets her first point of the match when the american hits the ball long , but williams 's strength pays off again , and she forces the break .
mistake feature highly at the start of the second game of the set as the pattern of the match continues . makarova hits the net with a loose backhand , and then overhits her forehand on the next shot to hand halep control of the game . halep hits a winner to earn three break points , but the russian rallies with good tennis to cut it to a single point . her serve comes her rescue again with a shot down the 't ' to force a couple of errors from halep to bring up a game point . makarova secures a crucial hold as halep overhits her forehand , which could be a long way in helping her secure the match .
after robson takes the first point , erakovic is unlucky to fall victim to a poor call from the lines judge , but she still takes the replayed point . where has this laura robson been ? two quick points , the second of which is an ace out wide , and she has two game points . the new zealander saves the first , but robson shows immense speed to chase down a drop shot to put away the winner .
radwanska has another chance to break and this time she does , drawing li forward with a slice and the chinese ca n't whip it over .
hmmmm . the pole also breaks to love and that 's one of the oddest starts you 'll see to a tennis match . expect many more breaks today as neither woman is particularly confident on serve but much better at returning .
williams looks in an uncompromising mood as he drills a backhand winner down the line , but safarova responds well to get to 30-15. williams remains in the game with more heavy hitting but safarova comes through with the hold and that shouldsettle any lingering nerves that she may have .
very high success rate from stephens at the net and she sets up a first break point with a good approach . a booming forehand later and she 's back on serve ! excellent from the american .
these planes just wo n't go away . it must be distracting the players . muguruza gifts williams a point with a wild backhand which drifts long . the umpire steps in to call the ball out in the next rally , and williams , who rarely challenges , does n't ask for the technology . they exchange points once again , and we hear a first `` come on '' from williams . however , a double fault brings up break point . muguruza is almost on her knee to force deuce with a backhand which clips the line . she needs to produce some magic again to save break point with a perfectly constructed rally which ends with williams finding the net . the quality is very high . muguruza takes advantage , but williams responds with a forehand winner off the second serve . a similar effort produces a third break point . she misses the chance to convert again , and muguruza eventually capitalises to hold with another winner . that could be a crucial hold .
she 's finally on the board here and it took a while coming . pironkova played two really good points , but the pole did well to quell her efforts there . still two break behind , though .
after a real battle in that one kuznetsova serves a double fault . it 's a double azarenka break and there wo n't be long left in this match .
sharapova begins her service game with a dime right down the middle of the court which bouchard ca n't return . bouchard continues her nervy start with a poor backhand into the net before sharapova double faults . more tennis poor tennis from the 20-year follows as she hits her first shot of the rally into the net and then out to lose the game . not a good start from the seventh seed .
the double is followed by a careless volley but she manages to hold as li misses a simple forehand of her own at the net .
better from sharapova , who connects with a second-serve return to win the first point , but the russian goes just wide in the next point . the pair trade mistakes , before serena drills down a 120mph ace . a double fault follows , but another ace - this time at 118mph - helps the american to the hold .
that 's impeccable length from erakovic , who finds the tramline with a forehand . the service barrage continues too , as she records her fifth ace to move to 40-0. robson takes the next point with some aggressive hitting from inside the court , but an excellent second serve seals the game for erakovic .
she does n't want to wait any longer kvitova . a really strong service game ends with an angled drop shot that makarova ca n't get to . we 're with serve in the third , but the momentum is all behind kvitova .
kvitova has had some success at the net today , despite using her shots there sparingly . she comes in for a volley early in this game though , helping her to a 30-0 lead . pennetta hits a run of excellent serves though , resulting in more errors from the czech to allow her to keep the set on serve .
keys continues to show some power off her own serves and she forces radwanska into several errors , before grasping a lead with a standout ace . the american wraps up the game when her opponent ca n't quite come up with the required forehand to return .
ivanovic finishes a superb game with an ace and takes the set at the same time . marvellous tennis .
the pole saves another break point on her way to a hold . she 's not on top , however , and keys looks most likely to break . however , if radwanska manages it here then she takes the set .
break back ! she 's done it ! when serena broke early in the set most would have expected the american to race away with it like she did in the second . however , lisicki is a fighter and breaks back in the third thanks to williams 's pulled backhand .
williams is struggling to get her first serve in at the moment , but it does n't seem to be hampering her too much , she raced to a 40-0 lead before allowing her opponent a point after missing a low forehand , then forcing a mistake from cornet to take game .
serena holds so azarenka will now serve for the us open title ! can she keep her nerve ?
sharapova ends up cruising to the second set . she is looking good now as the match heads into a decider . bartoli will have to match her or this could be over very soon .
the serving is excellent as williams races to 40-0 without giving her rival a sniff . muguruza attempts to get on top of a second serve , and the results are excellent as she sends williams the wrong way with a forehand . `` shot , '' responds williams . you ca n't argue with that . a lob in the next rally looks to put muguruza in trouble , but she retreats to execute the perfect smash . however , an ace hands the game to williams .
too good from radwanska in that rally . a 26-shot rally ends with li going long after typical accurate hitting from the pole . she will now serve for the set .
li copes well with vinci 's dangerous backhands , coming into the net again , and this time winning the point with a stunning volley . an aggressive forehand brings up two more break points for the chinese player . she takes it with some strong forehands from just inside the baseline . what a start it 's been by the australian open finalist .
better from safarova , who powers an inside-out forehand into the corner for 30-0 before she repels some heavy hitting from her opponent to earn three game points . a love hold is completed when ivanovic blasts a return long of the baseline .
a hold to love for bartoli . she 's now one game away from the match . the crowd tries to lift lisicki as she prepares to serve but she must know that she has lost this .
sharapova takes control of the second set as her power proves too much for the 20-year who makes mistakes on every point to hand the russian the game . it is looking a bit ominous for the canadian now !
a comfortable service game to 15 brings up the opening set for li . she 's been utterly brilliant so far and sharapova - yes , sharapova - has had no answers at all . the russian is in trouble and must come out fighting in the second .
pennetta races into a 40-0 lead , mainly thanks to her trademark cross-court backhand , but vinci remains in the game with a super drop shot that leaves pennetta stranded at the back of the court . vinci then gets the benefit of a net cord and all of a sudden , we have a game on here , but pennetta holds her nerve to convert a volley out of the reach of her opponent .
williams holds to 15 as errani fails with an ambitious drop-shot .
what a huge hold that could be for marion bartoli ! she saves four break points before clinching the second game of the second set .
she was 15-30 down but azarenka fights back to hold for the first time in this match .
a stunning forehand allows williams to move 0-15 ahead when wozniacki can not return , but williams then nets for 15-15. a double-fault from wozniacki allows williams to move 15-30 ahead , but then the american hits a powerful forehand long for 30-30. a second double-fault for wozniacki allows williams to move onto 30-40 , but once again , williams hits long for deuce . the defending champion responds in the next point with a stunning forehand and breaks with a forehand down the line .
at advantage radwanska - twice - keys gets the better of two rallies to finish with big forehand winners . that 's 25 overall of those for the american . however , radwanska finishes with an ace and a really tough service hold . that could be crucial .
some excellent play from robson , allows her to dictate the early points from the baseline , but wozniacki recovers with excellent defensive play , firing a backhand behind her opponent . wozniacki 's defence again plays a big part as she breaks robson with a clever lob and good backhand at the net .
the dominance of each player 's serve is leading to a not very competitive contest at the moment . fascinating , certainly , but there 's not been a sniff of a break yet .
and there it is . makarova plops a tame shot into the net and it 's the perfect start after the long break for the czech . poor from makarova , though .
comfortable hold for li , as zakopalova hits a forehand into the tramlines . can she break again for the win here , or will we go on all night ?
safarova takes a bit of speed off a return and it works wonders as serena swings through her shot too early . it 's 15-15 , which should become 30-30 when safarova controls the fourth point of the game but she drills an attempted passing shot into the net . williams seals the game with a gigantic backhand winner from the baseline and she is well on her way to a third roland garros crown .
kvitova 's power continues to shine through as she moves 15-0 ahead when bouchard fails to return a powerful serve , but kvitova hits the net in the next point for 15-15. two quick points follow for kvitova as bouchard fires long and then hits the net , but kvitova then double-faults for 40-30. bouchard responds again as the game moves onto deuce , but the pair then exchange points for deuce two . eventually kvitova holds with a quite stunning running backhand .
good start to the second set from the american . that first point was the only one she lost and she won the game with a well-worked point , coming to the net for a drop shot .
gajdosova takes another break against the 20th seed in the women 's draw after wickmayer sends a forehand long . the belgian challenges the call , but the ball was out , and the australian will serve for the set .
goodness me , what a start by the chinese . she wins the first four points against serve to immediately break .
she holds comfortably - is radwanska getting a game here ?
which she does ! launching a forehand up the line that dips into the corner . surely that 's game over ?
it looks to be a step too far for the young american . azarenka is still in a very low gear , but seals the set with a quite marvellous lob .
sharapova looks like she 's on her way to a comfortable hold of serve as she fires a backhand down the line , but a double fault on the next point keep vandeweghe in contention , but another stunning stroke down the line from sharapova and a long return from the american allow the fourth seed to consolidate her break .
keys is continuing but she winces when netting a backhand on the opening point . venus senses her moment but despite creating two break points , keys mixes her trademark power with a soft touch at the net to seal an impressive hold . she needed that , and i think it 's safe to say she wo n't be retiring from this match .
serena appears to have got accustomed to the muguruza serve now and a first serve is drilled straight back at the spaniard for 15-30. that soon becomes two break points when muguruza goes long , but the first is saved by some huge hitting from inside the court . the 21st seed does the same on the next point , taking the game to deuce , before muguruza registers two more points courtesy of first serves to get herself out of trouble . big hold .
second set knapp ! another unforced error from the sharapova backhand gives her opponent a break to love . this match is now all square !
good play from cibulkova at 40-15 down , who finds the line to force the error . can li hold ? yes ! an ace down the t levels us up . as it stands , we 're heading to a tie-break .
cibulkova edges 0-15 and 15-30 ahead but on each occasion , serena sends down an ace . she gets to set point with a third , before she completes the set with a fourth down the middle . astonishing power .
muguruza slips 0-30 down as williams senses the early finish , and three break points are created when the spaniard goes long . she only needs one as a flat forehand is n't dealt with by the world number 20 and serena will now serve for her sixth wimbledon title .
despite limited movement wozniacki digs deep to earn a crucial hold to start the second set . cetkovska made consistent unforced errors on the return side in that game , letting her injured adversary off the hook all too easily .
williams goes for a drop shot at the start of the game , but fails to get the ball back over the net . a series of powerful forehands from the back of the court by the world number one force garcia to over-hit the ball , bringing up break point , and williams clinches it with a superb forehand return .
like sharapova , williams is not getting enough first serves in , but her impressive forehand helps her to a 40-15 lead , but a careless shot hits the net . however , williams clinches the game with a well-struck forehand from well inside the baseline .
williams has quickly stamped her authority all over this match . barty looks rushed by the power of the world number one , and williams is 40-0 up in next to no time . that 's much better from the 17-year-old , though , who goes toe-to-toe with serena before drawing the mistake at the net , and williams shows a bit of weakness in throwing in a double fault . however , a first serve finds the mark , and the break of serve is consolidated .
break and set ! li moves to 0-30 , as she did twice earlier on in the second set , but this time is able to convert the advantage and grab the set . we 're headed to a decider on centre !
the dane holds to edge ahead in this final set . we 're still on serve though . this really could go either way .
this is just getting more dramatic with every game ! williams races into a 30-15 lead , but two silly unforced errors gives azarenka break point . a powerful second serve is finished off with a volley by serena to go to deuce , before she hits an eighth ace of the match . a backhand winner sees her cling on , and both sit down for a much-needed break .
it 's an important hold for azarenka . she was down in the game and could have been facing a break , but she remained strong to put the pressure back on stephens .
an early hold for world number two radwanska . over to you miss jankovic .
kvitova continues to be hampered by unforced errors as she quickly slips 40-0 behind . pennetta tries something different , coming into the net in a bid to volley , but mis-times her shot . kvitova ca n't get her return back off the next point though , allowing pennetta to level the scores in the second set .
important hold for sharapova , who battled back from 0-30 to take the game . we have finally seen signs that mattek-sands can play , but her game is still far too error-strewn - she threw her break point chance away .
cirstea is yet to find the rhythm on her serve , making another double fault . however , she digs deep to fight back from 30-0 down to bring up deuce . a long ball from williams gives the romanian advantage , but a forehand to the net returns the game to deuce , before two double faults hand the game to williams .
vinci continues with good work to move 40-0 ahead on her opponent 's service game , a special backhand volley winner coming off mladenovic 's opening serve . vinci wraps up the all-important break when mladenovic fails on the forehand .
muguruza gets the second set underway , but bacsinszky claims the opening point by forcing a backhand error . the spaniard responds by drawing things level , but ca n't follow through as she sends a terrible shot into the net from close range . an impressive rally concludes when muguruza shoots long to establish a break point for bacsinszky , and she takes it by forcing her opponent long down into the corner .
robson still shows a few nerves on serve , adding another double fault , but she recovers , and finishes the game with two stunning aces .
brilliant ! radwanska moves in for the kill at the net after a backhand , but sees the ball fizz past her from the keys forehand . a big break early in the second set for the american .
meanwhile , the belarusian holds so sharapova will now serve to stay in this match . big pressure on the russian .
brilliant start from williams as she hits a superb forehand for 15-0 , but the american then clips wide to hand wozniacki 15-15. williams has 30-15 in the next point when wozniacki hits long of the baseline and the dane follows suit in the next point for 40-15. finally we have a hold of serve when wozniacki nets once more .
the three-time champion hits a couple of crisp winners and she has the hold . azarenka seems to be sussing out the serve a bit more but that 's only half the problem . even if you keep the ball in play you have to deal with serena 's huge groundstrokes .
no , she ca n't . two more awful shots - the first a baffling attempt at a forehand winner when over the highest part of the net - concede the game and that 's now three in a row for the american . she 's improved , certainly , but there 's a strong element of sharapova imploding and she has to sort it out .
sharapova breaks ! we have a third consecutive break as sharapova wins game three to 15. significantly though , unlike the server in the previous two games , knapp was serving from the less-sun-affected northern end on this occasion . massive moment for maria , who should close out comfortably from here .
vinci is creating openings for herself on the williams serve , but so far , she is n't taking them . a glaring miss with her forehand helps williams create two game points . however , from then onwards , serena looks nervous , and despite saving a break point , she goes long on a second and vinci has the break without doing a whole lot . interesting .
not long now ... cibulkova has not been able to eliminate the errors from her game , while li has to a certain extent . that 's made enough difference for li to be cruising in this second set .
azarenka gets the opening point on the board with a nicely-struck volley , but halep gets her into a rally , leveling the game with a backhand winner . a big serve from the 20th seed is followed up by a superb forehand down the line though , putting her 40-15 up . a double fault prolongs the game though , allowing halep to take it to deuce with a backhand return right on the sideline . halep misses her return though , allowing azarenka to seal it with a couple of solid net shots .
fortune shines on cetkovska once more as a bounce falls her way at the net , saving the second break point to force deuce . that exchange forces a response from the czech contender , who shows some timely aggression to hold with a huge forehand winner across court .
double break ! lisicki 's forehand drifts long and that 's a double break for bartoli who will now serve for the first set .
the set loss has awoken radwanska . eight points from eight go her way to start this set and she 's racing ahead without being brilliant .
sharapova does n't give up , however , and fights back to take the important break .
what a game of tennis ! azarenka double faults again at the beginning of the game , but she recovers to crash a backhand up the line for a clean winner . williams hits back with some powerful groundstrokes , and she finishes the point with a driving volley at the net . the decibel level of their screams goes up and up during the next point , much to the amusement of the crowd , but azarenka wins it with a accurate volley down the line . williams takes it to deuce , but she can only put a slice in the net as azarenka 's intense hitting gets the better of her . the tennis is just getting better and better now , as williams darts forward to squeeze a shot cross court for a winner , before she earns a break point when azarenka nets . can she take it ? no ! she squanders the chance as she over-hits a forehand , but she earns a second with a brilliant backhand winner . azarenka survives for a second time , and then again for a third time when williams chips long . finally , azarenka earns game point but we go back to deuce again as williams sends a forehand down the line . azarenka wins the next two points to hold on though , and that could be crucial .
it 's another hold and again it 's quite comfortable . as it stands we 're heading into a breaker , but i suspect we might see a break in one of the next four games ...
muguruza strikes early with a beautiful passing shot before radwanska goes wide to concede 0-30. the spaniard 's power helps her prevail from a lengthy exchange to earn three break points , and although the first is saved , the second is converted when radwanska slices into the net . this first set is slipping away from the pole .
a short return from sharapova allows williams to come into the court and smash the ball onto the sideline , before the american fires the ball down the opposite sideline into an empty court , with sharapova out of position following the serve . an ace wraps up a strong service game for williams , leaving her just two games from winning the tournament .
stosur has other ideas though . it 's a swift hold from the aussie , who is just two games away from a place in the quarter-finals now .
despite the outburst , azarenka comes through that game and squeals `` come on ! '' to let ivanovic know that she has n't given up on this set yet .
she takes it with her second chance , setting up a point brilliantly to slam the winner at the net . that 's one of two breaks back . this is getting good .
an unlikely break for the romanian as azarenka capitulated . it still needed a clinical touch from niculescu , however , and she goes two up in the second .
good start to her service game from makarova as she creates an opening for a forehand winner , which she slams down the line . sharapova then goes wide with a backhand to hand her compatriot control of the game , but a couple of loose shots from the 10th seed level the game . the 2008 champion slams her backhand into the net , but more nerves are displayed as makarova goes long with her next strike to bring about deuce . the players exchange errors , but sharapova begins to display her power with a smash then backhand winner to earn a break point . sharapova ca n't take the first break point , but she gets another chance as makarova goes wide with a forehand on deuce , before the number two seed pulls out a forehand winner to take a vital lead in the set .
lisicki loses her rhythm on serve , missing her first serve on the opening couple of points , before a double fault brings up three break points for kanepi . she saves the first with a superb volley , but she makes another double fault to gift kanepi the game . that was a shocking game from the german , she did n't make a single first serve !
after the opening two points are shared , the court opens up for keys to make what should be a relatively routine passing shot but she over-hits it by several yards . the 19-year-old hangs around until 40-30 but she ca n't return venus 's next serve and she consolidates the break .
the world number two holds to 40. the game ends with hantuchova slashing a forehand return well wide . prior to that poor shot , all eight second-serve points in this match had been won by the receiver .
lim is on the board with a comfortable opening srevice game . she controls williams 's powerful returns well and uses her speedy footwork behind the baseline to get herself into the position to make winners . this has certainly been a promising start from lim .
what a start for the bulgarian ! both women come into the net but it 's the world number 72 , as radwanska goes wide with a difficult lob . the fourth seed needs to wake up here .
kvitova has gotten into a rhythm on her serve now , and she eases into a 30-0 lead . doi pulls a point back , but kvitova overpowers her opponent when stepping into court to put away a couple of forehands .
i think that williams is intent on finishing this one quickly . she puts barty on the defensive with two huge shots from the baseline , before producing the most delicate of drop shots to move to three break points . the first is saved by barty , but despite having williams on the run in the next exchange , she goes marginally long with a lob , and that 's the double break .
bacsinszky 's opening serve disappoints as she is forced to concede off the backhand . next up is a poor double fault that gives muguruza a 30-0 lead . bacsinszky comes back into it by pushing the spaniard into two errors on the backhand . more great pressure from the swiss player sees muguruza send another backhand high and beyond the baseline , leaving bacsinszky to take the game with a superb forehand volley towards an empty corner at the back of the court .
kvitova moves 15-0 ahead when bouchard nets from the baseline , but bouchard does respond with a brilliant forehand for 15-15. another stunning backhand from kvitova moves the czech onto 30-15 , before bouchard fails to respond to a second serve for 40-15. kvitova moves into the net in the next point , but bouchard fires a backhand down the line for 40-30. deuce then arrives when kvitova wildly fires a forehand past the baseline . eventually kvitova manages to hold with an ace .
vandeweghe claims the opening point of the match with an excellent forehand return . sharapova levels it up with a big second serve on the next point , but is struggling to get her first serves in at the start of this match , allowing the american to put her under pressure at the net and force a wide cross-court forehand from the russian , giving her two break points . sharapova powers her serve down the middle to save the first , while vandeweghe slices her backhand into the net to take the game to deuce . a brilliant backhand return from vandeweghe gives her another chance to take sharapova 's serve , but the russian ups the pace on her serve to save it . a mis-hit from the young american tees sharapova up for a volley though , which allows the fourth seed to escape with her serve intact . what a start from vandeweghe though , bringing up four break points in the opening game of the match .
keys is looking at ease out there as she slams a forehand winner down the line , while she then forces a miscue from serena to take a 30-0 lead . an ace follows as she fires a serve right down the middle , which beats serena for pace , but an unforced errors gifts the 33-year-old a point back . keys secures the hold as williams finds the net with a loose backhand . a great start for the 19-year-old .
a good , and important , hold for pironkova . radwanska cannons a return wide and the bulgarian stays alive in the set .
a winner from li there and she races 3-0 up inside 15 minutes . there 's not a lot going for cibulkova at the moment and if she loses three more games ( without coming back ) she will taste grand slam final defeat . this has been a strong response from li after a very unconvincing first set . to be honest , she 's fortunate she 's against a player who has never been in a final or she might well be a set down .
another gruelling service game but this time it ends in success for stephens . she 's got a game on the board and that will be a boost to her .
halep continues her resurgence as she nails her first serve which yields the first point of the game , while she does extremely well to take control of the game with an excellent backhand after makarova had her on the ropes . two further mistakes from the russian hand halep the game , and just like that she 's back in the set .
however , the pole takes the game and we 're with serve at the moment .
and there it is ! wozniacki makes things interesting . a quick hold would be very welcome . or at least just a hold . i 'm sure she 's not too fussy .
more punishing play from azarenka , who is really finding the corners and sides with her shots . it 's another comfortable service game and the dominant azarenka is three up after just nine minutes . could be a swift day 's work for the 23-year-old .
radwanska races into a 30-0 lead as the game looks to be following a similar pattern as the rest in the set , but the american hits back as she finally produces a solid return game before firing two forehand winners to tie the game at 30-30. keys lets radwanska earn a game point with a loose forehand into the net , and she would come to regret that as the pole produces a fine backhand down the line to repel a fierce baseline drive from the 20-year-old to seal the game . a good contest in that game .
sharapova opens the second set with a hold to love and she is looking far more convincing than she did 30 minutes ago . she 's taken the last five games , and kirilenko needs to find a way of stopping the rot .
that 's huge for azarenka . she holds to love and takes control of this second set , a set that she has to win .
miss robson is within a game of the match , can clijsters take this any further ?
the chinese recovers well from that though to hold serve with a pair of winners , her 12th and 13th of the match .
incredible point to start the game . williams charges to the net , and stretches to get the most unlikely of volley to drop over the net after muguruza attempted the pass . a big serve hands williams another point before muguruza makes it 30-15. a double fault opens the door slightly , but williams hits back with an ace before taking the opener .
the mistakes are totting up for the 19-year-old as she drills a backhand into the net . however , she manages to win the next three points in a row with impressive strokeplay on her forehand to bring about a break , but serena shows her class with an ace to the outside . the errors return from keys and along with excellent serving from the number one seed , she manages to clinch the hold .
sharapova gets herself into li 's next service game with a big forehand for 40-30 , but li again holds and is just fending off the russian at the moment .
it 's the third time sharapova has closed out a game with an ace and it 's now 4-4. azarenka asked plenty of questions in that one but the 2006 champion answered them firmly .
ivanovic ensures that azarenka does n't race clear in the set by holding herself for the first time in five service games . winners : ivanovic 27-8 azarenka , unforced errors : ivanovic 23-17 azarenka .

keys takes the first two points on her serve , but venus stops a rot of losing six points in a row after moving her opponent around the court . keys wo n't want too many points like that . she 's in a lot of discomfort but she finds some magic at the net to reduce the deficit to one . keys needs to be careful here , though . she does n't want to aggravate an injury that might keep her out of a semi-final anyway .
mladenovic starts things well by moving into a 30-0 lead , but a couple of mistakes give vinci a chance . maybe not , though , as the frenchwoman comes back with a punishing ace to set up two game points for the hold . she eventually takes it with a standout forehand down into the corner . a momentum change , perhaps ?
it 's an aggressive start from sharapova , but would we really expect anything else ? she has mixed joy from the back of the court but she still manages to bring up 30-30. the 2006 winner improves to create a couple of break-point opportunities in a lengthy game but it 's a fine response from kirilenko who manages to hold serve .
the crowd are on their feet , and rightly so . the pair play a glorious point , which concludes when williams whips a forehand cross-court for 30-0. that 's soon followed up with an ace , before azarenka goes long to leave williams one game away from a 17th major title .

radwanska is firmly in control now as watson gives up her serve to love , ending on a double fault . promising start , but the pole 's class is shining through now , watson has no answers at the moment .
williams has dropped just three points behind her first serve . that 's how good she has been today . she is still susceptible to a double fault though , with a third being conceded to hand safarova a look at 15-15. how do you respond to that ? with a 198kmph ace and a 23rd winner of the match . williams has two game points but they are both saved by the czech thanks to a return winner and williams mistake . safarova then creates her first break point of the match , which she takes thanks to a third double fault of the game from her opponent . interesting .
serena wo n't be ruffled , but she 'll be concerned at how brilliantly azarenka is playing . the 20-time grand slam champion powers down two aces to start the second set , before azarenka hits one out of play . a third ace flies past azarenka 's racket , and it 's a good start for serena .

kerber looks comfortable on serve and she sends down an ace to complete a hold to-love .
sharapova will have to earn this set win . mattek-sands produces her best service game of the match so far to put the balls back in sharapova 's court . all she needs to do now is hold , but that has n't been easy in her last three service games .
a solid opening service game from robson . she had to rely on her second serve a couple of times , but her play during rallies was excellent . now she needs to attack the kvitova serve .
inconsistency is blighting stephens game as back on serve she quickly falls 0-40 behind . a fourth unforced error quickly follows and bartoli has her third break in a row , easing ahead by a set and a break in a topsy-turvy quarter-final .
things are not going sharapova 's way at the moment . everything is just off for her , but fractions . she pulls a point back to make it 30-15 but jankovic replied by earning a break point . the champion comes short to the net and plays a tricky drop shot , which forces jankovic to hit her reply out . sharapova finishes the game with a double fault . shocking stuff .
well , she almost threw it away , but makarova does indeed take a topsy-turvy opener . how will the german respond ? she 'd love an early break .

the players ' service games are holding strong at the moment and muguruza takes a 30-15 lead by forcing her opponent onto the back foot . the number 20 seed ca n't keep up the pressure , however , and bacsinszky draws the scores level . muguruza then double faults to setup the break point , but pushes back for deuce . the 21-year-old saves the break point and takes the game by forcing two consecutive errors .
muguruza lost five games in a row to lose that second set , something which ca n't continue if she wants to stay in this match . she saves a break point with an ace , but when she faces a second , she fires a forehand long of the baseline . this is radwanska 's to lose now .
awful start to the second set for hantuchova , as williams breaks ! two backhand errors and a double fault move serena 15-40 in front . she then maintains her 100 % conversation rate ( 2/2 ) when hantuchova cracks a fizzing backhand off target .

it 's a positive start from radwanska , who converts a forehand winner into the corner to earn 30-15 , but a poor drop shot allows muguruza to step in to put away a winner of her own . the radwanska second serve looks a shot to be targeted , and muguruza gets to deuce after a fierce return sets up a dominant point . the spaniard sets up a break point but she ca n't convert after netting a forehand . however , a second chance arises and she takes it , firing a forehand into the corner . this is her first appearance on centre court but she has settled immediately .
the first half of the game is littered with errors , and williams has 30-30. azarenka looks nervous , and another mistake gifts her opponent break point . that could be that i think . azarenka 's forehand hits the top of the tape and williams will serve for the champion for the third time . can she do it ?
much better from cibulkova , who drives a forehand towards the baseline for a 30-0 lead but serena is middling every second serve that comes her way and she halves the deficit . the 11th seed does n't wilt though and she holds to 30 to force serena to serve for the set .
azarenka finds some powerful serves , forcing a run of three straight long returns from her opponent , but she misses her first serve while trying to clinch the game , allowing halep to dictate the point from the back of the court and keep herself in the game , taking it to deuce on the next point when the 20th seed turns her forehand wide . azarenka lets out a huge shout of `` come on '' as halep fires long to give the belarusian advantage , which she converts with another excellent serve . it looks like azarenka is still trying to get herself pumped up for this match , but she 's just about keeping herself in contention in the first set .

clijsters stops the rot and now robson must hold to stay in the set .

muguruza starts strongly off her own service as she forces bacsinszky into two consecutive errors to move the score to 30-0. the towering spaniard takes the next point as her opponent can only scrape a backhand return into the net . bacsinszky hits back with a commanding forehand winner before delivering a superb backhand to draw deuce . bacsinszky does n't do herself any favours next up , though , as she produces poor work on the backhand to give muguruza the advantage . deuce is reached again when the swiss players comes up with a strong effort on the backhand , but then throws the game away with two straight errors .
a big forehand to the corner ca n't be returned by ivanovic and that 's the first game to the canadian . an encouraging hold .
robson needs to find some inspiration on erakovic 's serve , and she fires a return past the forehand of the new zealander to earn 15-15. now then , a stunning cross-court winner takes her to 15-30 , before she takes advantage of a slip from her opponent to earn two break points . that 's hugely impressive from erakovic though , who saves both with an ace and a driven forehand winner . another ace then takes her to game point , which she swiftly seals when robson sends a return long .
jankovic takes the opener in the second set , with a good shot at the feet of ivanovic , who had advanced to the net .
doi needs a fast start to this set , but she is immediately on the back foot after a huge forehand down the line from kvitova . she fights back to 30-15 , but two errors hand kvitova a break point . the japanese player shows tremendous heart , though , to take the the next three points to take an early lead in the second .
garcia seems to have lost a little of the intensity from her serve , and williams pounces with some impressive returns to bring up three break points . a return to the back corner of the court catches garcia out , leaving her stretching for the ball . she manages to get her racquet to the ball , but can only hit the ball into the net .
there have reportedly been a few concerns regarding williams 's fitness in the build-up to this match but she looks comfortable enough in hitting her way to a love hold . it should suit her serving first because if she can remain ahead , the pressure will always fall on bacsinszky 's shoulders .
it 's another double fault from sharapova and it 's another break for azarenka . the momentum has shifted dramatically in this one .
well there is no doubt as to who benefited from that extended break in play due to rain . at the third time of asking kvitova takes the first set , just edging a pair of lengthy baseline exchanges to leave the russian seething .
at the change of ends , williams is covering her neck in ice . she does n't look well at all . she takes the opening point of the sixth game but bacsinszky comes roaring back with a forehand winner down the line on the way to two game points . she only requires one after catching the line with another aggressive baseline shot and she looks in the groove here .
pennetta looks in a rhythm now and she breezes to a hold to 15. halep looks slightly disinterested towards the end of that game . the frustration of losing her serve obviously still bothering her .
she has a typically american style does keys . some big serves and big forehands help her to a very comfortable opening serve . she certainly does n't look like an 18-year-old out there .
too good from williams . another second serve is picked off , this time with the backhand . muguruza needs to keep her first serve percentage high . a venture into the net ends with muguruza hitting wide to give williams a chance . how do you respond ? an ace , of course . a couple of fly-overs in the past few minutes have distracted the players . if you did n't know , it 's australia day , so we could have fireworks causing problems later on . a couple of errors from williams allow muguruza to move 40-30 up , and an excellent forehand winner makes it 2-2 .
after battling back to advantage , zakopalova gets a huge slice of luck as her return hits the net and just goes over . early break for her , though . great start .
niculescu holds , although azarenka is looking the stronger of the two . in saying that , the romanian did show lovely touch with a forehand volley . an ace down the t wrapped up the game .
hmmm , maybe everyone - myself included - were getting ahead of themselves . keys opens with a double fault , and she 's visibly nervous . she takes the next point but her game unravels over the next three points to allow venus to edge a break in front in this second set .
it 's a poor start to the third set by li . she tries to smash a backhand cross-court , but puts far to much power behind the ball , and it goes long to give azarenka two break points , which she easily takes with a brilliant forehand .
li dominates from the back of the court , but some superb backhands from vinci help her get back into the game and bring up deuce . the sixth seed makes her first double fault of the match to give the italian a chance to break back , but li manages to save the break , before finding some big serves to escape from the game with her serve in tact .
garcia drops the opening two points of the game as williams continues her strong returning form from the first set . however , garcia ups the pace on her serve to get herself back into the game . the world number one forces a mistake from garcia to give herself a chance to get a break on the board , but a long return brings up deuce . garcia saves another break point before adding some variety to her serve to force a couple of mistakes on the return from williams , allowing her to hold serve .
cornet is furious with herself after throwing away a 40-0 lead to let williams hold her serve . the american had all sorts of problems with her serve , handing cornet three break points following a double fault . however , a string a mistakes from the french player let williams off . cornet will be needing a new racquet , after smashing her previous one against the court .
a loose start from watson , who concedes a double fault on the opening point , and a majestic backhand winner from keys gets her to 0-30. watson responds with an ace down the middle , but the american lets go with another backhand winner . is she really 18 ? crazy . she 's absolutely battering watson from the baseline , and she breaks back .
break back ! vandeweghe complains to the umpire again , seemingly unhappy with the way sharapova is moving around behind the baseline while she 's mid ball toss . however , it 's sharapova on serve now , and she 's taken a bit of the pace off to try to cut down the errors which plagued her first two service game , but that only allows vandeweghe to attack on the return , racing to a 40-0 lead , and she immediately gets the break back by coming inside the baseline to jab a forehand winner past the former champion . what an excellent response from the unseeded 23-year-old .
it is going to be interesting how keys responds to watson 's improvement because she is n't the same player who comfortably won the first set . she does show plenty of class to ease through this service game , however , and she reduces the deficit to one .
play is suspended ! more pure hitting from kvitova gets a service game finished just before the covers come on . you could see that the groundstaff were desperate to be unleashed on court one and get their wish , with play suspended until further notice .
all too easy in that game for the fourth seed as she holds to love with minimal fuss . radwanska is now one game away from a place in the quarter-finals .
azarenka wins the game with an emphatic smash after a deep forehand right into the corner .
williams holds . her serves were well under the 100mph mark there , but her overall play was more than good enough . stephens should be doing more , in my opinion .
a spirited display from ivanovic to grind out that hold under pressure and stay alive in the match . she still trails by a set and a break and needs to dig deep and take a chance on radwanska 's serve .
a weak second serve from keys gives venus the chance of 0-30 but she puts too much on her return . keys 's serve has dropped off in this game and venus knows it but despite getting to deuce , the youngster comes through with a fine hold to stay on level terms .
great use of the full court again from muguruza as she finds the corner with a forehand , before seeing williams go wide with a wild ground stroke . the second serve just has n't been good enough , and muguruza cashes in to set up three break points by unleashing another winner with the forehand . williams saves one with an ace , but she hits the net moments later as muguruza immediately breaks back . superb work from the 24th seed .
azarenka holds to 30 and is now within a game of taking us into a third set . all those ivanovic shots that found the lines and corners in the first just are n't coming off now .
big hold for knapp , who twice saves break point at 40-adv before holding serve with a cute volley at the net - her first point won at the net today .
vinci produces some telling attacking play by firing into the feet of mladenovic in order to draw level at 30-30. the italian 's next return is high and long , leaving the youngster with the chance to see out the game . vinci comes straight back , however , to bring about deuce before a poor approach gives mladenovic room to move ahead . vinci is not done yet , though , as she throws a return deep to draw parity once more . the players battle continuously at deuce , where vinci finally breaks free to earn an important lead after a mammoth 12-minute game .
savvy from vinci who drops over the net to catch her opponent short . mladenovic fails with two more errors ( there have been plenty ) and another forced forehand mistake ensures that vinci takes the game with ease .
double break ! at the fifth time of asking radwanska earns the double break as li hits wide with a forehand . she challenges the call but it was an inch out and is that game , set and match ?

serena now has the task of serving to stay in the set and she gets off to a good start with an ace . azarenka gets lucky off the net-cord to reach 15-15 , before williams serves a double fault ! some more excellent tennis from azarenka sees her earn two set points with a winner down the line , but williams saves the first and lets an almighty roar . azarenka then sends a backhand out of play to take it to deuce , and serena whacks a backhand into the corner to move ahead . azarenka nets a forehand next time around , and williams holds on . just .
williams holds to 15 .

from 0-30 down radwanska battles back well to hit a firehand winner and force an error to level the game . she then comes to the net for 40-30 and wins a very important service game with a fantastic backhand down the line - she did n't swing at it but it did n't half fly .
kvitova led her emotions get the better of her , arguing with the umpire over a line call . however , she re-discovered her composure and managed to hold on , putting the pressure back on robson 's serve .
the mistakes start to flow from the 19-year-old as she miscues her first backhand of the game , while her forehand then smacks into the net . williams ups the ante with her third ace of the game before keys makes another mistake to hand the hold to serena , who wins her third game in a row .

she needs just the one ! a backhand return down the line and radwanska does n't even move for it . incredible few games from li .
it 's an important hold for li , who powers a forehand to force the ball long from zakopalova . li means business in this set after the surprise of losing the first .
set azarenka : well , well , well . this did not appear to be on the cards 40 minutes ago . azarenka breaks to 30 and levels the match at one set all . 3.28pm rain ! it 's raining properly now and the players are leaving court . the delay should last no longer than 15 minutes , as the storm looks like it is only passing by . 3.29pm the covers are on . 3.31pm this pause in play will certainly benefit sharapova , who was beginning to lose her composure , especially after her disagreement with the umpire . the momentum was strongly with azarenka , but i think that may soon change once play restarts . 3.34pm play has also been interrupted on court suzanne lenglen , where bob and mike bryan have taken the first set 6-1 against alexander peya and bruno soares in the day 's second men 's doubles semi-final . 3.35pm the american duo are on course to face michael llodra and nicolas mahut in the final , after the french pair beat pablo cuevas and horacio zeballos 7-6 6-2 earlier this afternoon . 3.38pm the covers are being removed on court philippe chatrier , where play between sharapova and azarenka should resume imminently . 3.43pm the fans have returned to court , the lines people and umpire have also returned . we are just waiting for the players to emerge now . 3.47pm i think that this match will depend entirely on sharapova . if she is able to implement her attacking game , she will win . if not , azarenka will progress , as the belarusian possesses the stronger defensive skills . 3.55pm the warm-up is over and play will now resume . azarenka will serve to get the deciding set underway .

when sharapova misses her first serve , she is there for the taking and williams soon moves 0-30 ahead . she gets back on level terms but a tame first serve is drilled straight back at her by williams , who senses the double break . not for long though , sharapova finds an ace out wide . serena gets another opportunity before sharapova reels off three points in a row . that will hopefully settle a few nerves .
good service game from li , who is looking comfortable with the ball now . it 's finely poised this one and the set could still go either way .
a superb effort from stephens and this match is firmly back in the balance . the american took advantage of a pair of double faults from bartoli , finishing a long baseline exchange at break point by slamming a forehand into the corner . stephens looks fired up and ready for a fight tonight on court one , much to the obvious pleasure of a crowd rooting for the 20-year-old .
perfect start from kvitova as bouchard fails to return another serve for 15-0 , but the czech then double-faults to allow bouchard onto the board . bouchard then wins a difficult battle at the baseline to move 15-30 ahead , before sweeping a forehand down the line to set up two break points . kvitova hits the net in the next point as bouchard breaks .
excellent tennis from stephens . she runs williams around the court , right to left , before blocking a strong forehand with a neat volley to win the point . she serves an unreturnable one to lead 3-2 in the set .
li with an extremely fortunate hold of serve that included three dead net cords . radwanska also had one chance to earn the break straight back but could n't take it .
that 's four points in a row for ivanovic as she comes form 0-30 behind to hold serve and move within a couple of games of the first set on arthur ashe .
some frankly awful serving from kvitova gives robson another break . the brit struggled a little with her accuracy , missing a couple of forehands , but she takes the game regardless . robson will now serve for the match again .
robson needs to respond here , and she starts well with an ace down the middle . she looks in charge of the next point , but erakovic finds the line with a backhand . the brit looks nervous and she makes the error for 30-30 , but a fine topspin forehand proves to be a winner and she has game point . can she take it ? the answer is yes , with erakovic going wide from the back of the court . just one game away ...
li looks aggressive from the start , making a brilliant cross-court forehand to bring up break point . vinci tries to bring up deuce with a drop shot , but the sixth seed is able to get to the net in time and seal the game .
muguruza proves that she can be powerful too with a big first serve straight at williams . some good movement around the court gets the spaniard into a position to take the next point . williams is looking to dominate rallies , but she 's off target with a forehand which drifts long . a weak second serve allows williams to step forward to unleash a stunning forehand winner . it ca n't stop muguruza from holding though .
some solid serving helps li to a 40-30 lead , and with azarenka out wide she has the chance to hit the ball in to an open court , but she puts too much behind the volley to bring up deuce . a long stroke from li bring up break point for the defending champion , and she takes it by sending a strong return off the li serve back to the sixth seed , which she ca n't get back over the net .
a couple of wayward shots from muguruza gives her opponent a chance at 15-30 , but the spaniard is fortunate to catch the back of the baseline with a backhand to level the game . a first serve is sent out by radwanska t give her game point , before the 20th seed finds the line with an ace out wide .
neither player looks like wilting under the pressure , and that looks to be the case here . azarenka eases into a 40-15 lead , before williams hits back with some aggressive play . a double fault hands williams deuce , and after saving a break point , azarenka commits another service error to hand the american the initiative .
saving break points in her previous service game seems to have given garcia a boost as she looks super composed during a comfortable hold . she seems to be putting much more variation into her serves now , which is causing williams difficulty when making her returns .
it 's nine points in a row for li before she nets , but a routine service game for her moves her to within a game of the semi-finals .
sharapova 's dominance continues in the early stages as she wins the first point of the game , but bouchard battles back with two quality serves before she finds a forehand winner to bring up game point . the 20-year-old finally gets going as she works sharapova across the court before drilling a forehand across court to secure the game . better from the canadian as she looks to kick into gear .
break back ! two imposing down-the-line backhands from radwanska , the second a clean winner off the return , see her level up the second set .

williams breaks to love . this is painful to watch . right now , i ca n't even see errani getting a single game on the board .
better from halep , who is connecting with the ball with much more authority . she moves 0-30 up , which progresses to three break points after pennetta misses a volley at the net . the break is sealed when halep gets her opponent on the run , who ends up driving a backhand several yards over the baseline .
two doubles in a row ! a game that started with such promise ends in the worst possible fashion for li as she slumps to a lost service game . we 're back level .
all the momentum is with the world number one now . she claims the opening couple of points with some powerful serves , before kuznetsova tries to get the better of her with a volley , but the russian mistakenly leaves the ball , thinking that it is going long . another big serve following by a shot from the net seals the game for williams , and she needs just one more to make the last four .
holds do n't come much simpler than that for radwanska as she takes the game with a love service . her serve is accurate and puts the american under immediate pressure , which fires her into a 30-lead . keys goes for depth on her last two returns to get into the game , she goes long on both shots to hand the game to radwanska .
lovely volley to hold from radwanska . keys went for the big pass but radwanska got racquet on it to softly put it back out of reach of the american .
some excellent serves and a stunning volley help robson to a fairly straight-forward hold . her coach looks exhausted , but the brit still looks fairly fresh .
yes ! she 's done it . that is stunning from robson . she 's faced seven match points in the last two games but she is still alive and kicking .
a backhand return from williams takes her to 15-15 , before a devastating forehand winner heaps the pressure on sharapova at 15-30. serena has two chances for the double break after a huge return , but both are saved by sharapova who finally finds some length behind her first serve . the russian could have wilted here , but she gets through the game and seems rejuvenated .
my , my ! what a response from bartoli . she outpowers sharapova , who could only manage to get to 30. game well and truly on .
well that was pretty easy for world number one azarenka . stosur is playing too many shots down the middle of the court at the moment .
this is vintage clijsters at the moment as she holds to-love .
she only needs one of them , as kvitova goes wide and long with a forehand . we 're back with serve when a few minutes ago it looked all but over .
the russian breaks to love and breathes new life into this set . it 's hard to say if wozniacki choked a bit there . it was more down to kuznetsova 's hitting , although the dane did take a bit of mustard off her serve .
positive start from bouchard as kvitova nets for 15-0 , but the canadian then fires wide for 15-15. bouchard moves 30-15 ahead in the next point as kvitova nets , before the czech fires wide to hand bouchard a 40-15 lead . kvitova responds in the next point for 30-40 , before producing a stunning backhand for deuce - brilliant , brilliant tennis from the 2011 champion . another brilliant forehand moves kvitova onto advantage and she secures another break when bouchard fires wide .
lisicki holds thanks to some gutsy play . at deuce she goes for that iffy drop shot and radwanska gets there but ca n't quite reach lisicki 's loopy backhand pass before the german holds firm on the next .
sharapova quickly levels to put the pressure back on mattek-sands . has the momentum shifted at a good time for the russian ?

a 118mph serve has stephens bunting the ball back into williams 's court , and the third seed rushes to the net and dispatches a forehand winner . serena 's playing at half capacity , if that ...
azarenka finally seems to have settled in to this match , forcing mistakes from her opponent to bring up three break points . li finds a cross-court backhand that just hits the sideline to save the first , but she hits the net on the next point , and azarenka is right back in this first set .
this is getting silly now ! i ca n't recall the last time one of these two held their own serve . radwanska now leads 4-3 with a serve to come . so expect it to be four each shortly !
knapp breaks back ! perhaps sharapova is not quite in total control ! she wins a brilliant point with a stunning forehand winner to level the game at 30-30 , but then wastes her good work with back-to-back unforced errors to hand knapp parity in set two . knapp deserves much credit for staying in the game 's final point , which lasted 12 strokes .
seriously , what is happening in this match . safarova eases to a love hold and williams seems on the brink of capitulation .
azarenka looks to be finding her form again , but some great attacking returns from li allow her to take the game to deuce . the belarusian 's third double fault of the match gives li a break point , but a high lob from the chinese player on the next point goes just long . azarenka forces advantage before a brilliant shot down the sideline seals the game for her . it 's been two very tight games at the start of the this second set .
much improved from robson as she gets her second game on the board . can she mount a comeback in this opener ?
write off serena at your peril . she got a huge piece of help from a stephens double fault and then forces the youngster into going long to take the break . stephens lost that then and serena has called the trainer .
that 's better from the american . she does what she did in the first set by holding to love with her first service game .
much better from williams . she reads the serve perfectly throughout the game , and the american suddenly has three break points thanks to an unstoppable return with the forehand . muguruza hits back with a forehand winner of her own , and a wayward stroke from williams makes it 30-40. ace ! what a time to deliver one of those . not only does muguruza save three break points , but she wins the next two points to take the opener . are we heading for another shock ?

an extremely comfortable hold for radwanska , who is now a game away from the wimbledon quarters .
clijsters is just about hanging on here as she holds because of robson dumping a pair of forehands into the net .
the 12th seed does hold on the next point though , kneeling low to push a forehand up the line that bouchard can then only drag wide with her backhand .
muguruza should be 0-15 ahead but wastes a routine return off a second serve , before only finding the net with a forehand from inside the court . sloppy . a sublime defensive lob takes radwanska to three game points , but muguruza stays alive with a forehand winner . that 's followed by a backhand winner and a radwanska error and all of a sudden , we are at deuce . the pole survives though , despite being taken to a second deuce , but muguruza will serve for a place in the final .
another ace down the middle takes williams to 15-0 before a big first serve sees the spaniard go long with a return . a second ace of the game - the ninth of the match - earns three game points , and the first is taken when a forehand is miscued by the 21st seed . this match could be over very , very soon .

confident stuff on serve from robson has the court one crowd roaring in approval . kanepi clearly moved inside to put pressure on her opponent 's serve in that game but to no avail , with the brit responding strongly to claim a comfortable hold . kanepi must now serve to keep the second set alive .
azarenka regains some confidence with an unstoppable forehand winner to get to 15-15 , but an attack of the second serve is wayward from the belarusian moments later . it is the right tactic , though , and she capitalises on another weak serve before halep goes long with a backhand . azarenka should punish another second serve after taking control of the rally , but an unforced error from the back of the court leaves her frustrated . a superb forehand return winner gets azarenka back to deuce , and a double fault brings up break point . brilliant ! azarenka controls the point with some excellent ground strokes and delivers a fine drive volley before halep drifts wide with the running backhand .
serena 's her usual self when she has the ball on her racquet but she looks so lethargic . she does n't have to do any running to open up a 40-0 lead but she allows bacsinszky to remain in the game as soon as the rally is extended past a few shots . another bacsinszky winner takes her back to 40-30 but serena gets the hold when her opponent sends a second-serve return wide .

a good response to losing that first set from the romanian . she wins her opening service game after forcing azarenka wide with her return .

a fourth return winner from lisicki saves the first game point but radwanska converts on the second , taking charge of the point before easing a forehand into the open court .
williams looks a little vulnerable here after being overpowered by the 25-year-old but after falling 0-30 behind , the american finds two huge first serves . however , bacsinszky is playing some unbelievable tennis , and after hitting a first-serve return winner to save a game point , she takes the next two points with a lob and a cross-court backhand to seal the first break of the match . we could have a game on here .
another ace from kvitova moves the czech 15-0 ahead and that quickly becomes 30-0 following a powerful smash from the middle of the court . a forehand pass then makes the score 40-0 , before kvitova secures the hold with another powerful serve . brilliant tennis and bouchard is just struggling at the moment .
kerber dumps it into the net and it 's break point for venus .

an early ace is again followed by some erratic serving , including a double-fault from robson . a backhand drops just wide to give wozniacki break-point and another double-fault sees the dane go two ahead .
as i say that , she responds with a fantastic piece of net play , first pulling azarenka in with the drop shot before hitting the volley to the other side .
what a recovery from jankovic . sharapova powered her way into a 30-0 lead before the serb stormed back to pick up the first break . she is doing really well at using sharapova 's power to her advantage early on here .
serena opens with an ace but cibulkova , who has shown no let up in her work-rate , is encouraged at 15-30. she has a good play in the next rally but serena is extremely fortunate when the ball hits the tape and drops over . it could be one of those days for cibulkova . serena holds to 30 with a second-serve that is n't returned .

break and set ! whoa ! ivanovic crashes a forehand just over the net and it 's simply too hot for azarenka to handle even though it 's not wide of her . fantastic set from the underdog .
muguruza shows some fight by stepping into court to drive a backhand into the corner before serena concedes another double fault , her seventh of the match . surely there are n't nerves just yet ? muguruza earns three break points with a booming forehand from the back of the court and a williams error sees one of the breaks retrieved . the start of a miraculous comeback ? you never know .
knapp breaks ! sharapova 's third double fault gives knapp a second break point , which is converted when the third seed pushes a forehand just beyond the baseline .
knapp continues to play with real aggression and is duly rewarded as she comes out on top in two powerful forehand exchanges with sharapova , who then donates a couple of backhand errors , which are gratefully received . in other words , knapp wins four consecutive points and holds to 30 !
two aces and a wild muguruza forehand allow williams to reach 40-15 , before muguruza just misses the baseline with a return . important service game coming up .

this is a must-win game for azarenka , who has lost the last seven in a row . but when williams is timing backhands as well as this , winning a point is difficult . the american sweetly dispatches one down the line to take the score to 15-15 , but azarenka responds with a well-struck winner of her own . williams is just too good right now though , as she hits another winner and then forces a break point . azarenka saves it with a big second serve which williams can only net , and she holds on to win a gutsy game . she yells `` come on '' , and the crowd responds with loud applause .
as i feared at the start , it 's becoming another whitewash . a shame , but sharapova just has too much power - for most in the wta tour , in fairness .
williams wastes no time in easing ahead in the game , firing down an ace for 30-0 , but a second double fault reduces barty 's deficit . however , in trademark fashion , a blistering ace brings up two set points , but an inspired cross-court backhand from barty keeps her in the set . it 's not for long , though , and another huge serve helps williams take the set .

quick hold from azarenka . her first serve percentage reads 100 % , which is n't bad ...
azarenka holds comfortably again and stephens will have to start getting into her serve a little .
a good response from radwanska then , who holds fairly comfortably to force errani - who will be nervous - to serve out the set .
instead she decides to win the point after an astonishing rally . she 's first on defence , but turns it around to win the point with a big smash . can she hold this time ? if she does , she 's in the fourth round .
the russian starts with a powerful serve down the 't ' which yields a poor return before she crashes a winner into the corner with a fierce forehand . bouchard tries to match the number two seed stroke for stroke but ca n't control her forehand into the corner and then hits a loose backhand . the 20-year-old is long her on return again as sharapova moves further ahead in the set .

on this form , can anyone stop serena williams ? the american hits four first serves which azarenka can do little with to move 4-1 ahead . after that gutsy hold last time out , azarenka must be deflated .
kanepi makes a strong start to her service game , but a double fault keeps lisicki in touch . the estonian fights back with a pacy ace , before sealing the game with an aggressive volley at the net . she 's been displaying an impressive range of shots the afternoon , and can still get back into this match if she can cut down on the mistakes .

easy hold for sharapova . three big first serves see her race into a 40-0 lead . azarenka then fails to punish a rare second serve , as she fires wide from well inside the baseline on the ad court .
na gets the break ! really strong play once she got to deuce and that could be the beginning of the end of this one . sharapova simply must respond .
oh dear . keys sets up a point nicely for the chance to move 40-30 behind , but skews her forehand wide . that was probably radwanska 's most comfortable service game of the match so far .

i 'm starting to feel a little sorry for vinci . her serve looks so weak , probably because williams is returning it with so much ferocity . the 21-time grand slam winner misses out with two set points , but on the third , vinci goes long with a backhand when attempting to sneak into the net . business as usual as far as williams is concerned .

keys hits backs with a hold of her own as radwanska 's return skills have dropped in the past 20 minutes . the american 's serve was under pressure in the first , but since the middle of the second , the pole has been unable to register much resistance . keys secures the game relatively quickly to tie the set a 2-2. the match is very much in the balance at the moment as neither player looks to be faltering on serve .
radwanska is known for being able to absorb the power of her opponents , but she 's struggled to contain muguruza in these early stages . the spaniard hits her way to three game points , and although radwanska improves to reach 40-30 , muguruza connectes with a one-two behind her serve to complete the game .

well it may not have been the best service game from williams , but she looks unstoppable as she returns the russian 's serve , claiming a 40-0 lead with a series of strong forehand strokes to bring up three break points , before a shot to the net from kuznetsova seals the game for the american .
the pair are back in their chairs after one point as radwanska nets a forehand .
a devastating break against robson . the brit was 40-15 up , but a string of errors allowed kvitova back in to the game , and she punished robson for her mistakes .
bouchard starts well as she finds a backhand winner to the baseline to pick up the first point of the game , while a double fault from sharapova gives her a glimmer of hope . however , the 27-year-old comes roaring back with an accurate serve and picks out the corner with her return and then powers back into the game moving bouchard around the court to get a game point . a loose shot from the number seven seed hands her the game as her forehand crashes into the bottom of the net .
after racing into a 40-0 lead , hantuchova loses her first service point of the match , shortly followed by her second . however , williams then shanks a backhand wide , as her opponent holds to 30 .
sharapova races to a 3-0 lead as williams is struggling with the rhythm of her serve . surely sharapova has to drop a game at some point , she 's now won 27 in a row at the australian open !
at 0-40 azarenka decides to turn it on . the final break point is saved with a superb backhand to wrong-foot her greek opponent . then came that superb rally and instead of a break the top seed is 4-0 up in the second .
muguruza holds an early lead after a mistake from bacsinszky , who is then undone be a telling backhand from the spaniard who holds control at 30-0. bacsinszky comes back into it by forcing muguruza into consecutive errors on the forehand . the errors continue for the 20th seed and bacsinszky takes the game following two mistakes on the back and forehand .
williams continues to look strong on serve , making a series of strong and accurate deliveries yet again to give herself an easy hold . except for the first game of the second set , garcia has not been able to test the williams serve .
the first two points are shared , but williams steals the advantage with a smash into the corner . a second smash takes the american to two break-back points , but the first goes begging , as does the second as williams slips when attempting a forehand . another shot into the net gives vinci a game point , but she double faults . the tension ! the second serves of vinci are slowing down but she survives . she is one game away from one of the biggest shocks since ... ever .
williams nets a second-serve return , but she replies with a serve to the body that azarenka can do nothing with . williams looks focused and after holding her second service point , a cross-court winner brings up the mini-break . azarenka goes for broke on the net , and a drive volley catches the back of the line . unbelievable stuff from azarenka , who drills a shot straight at the advancing williams , who nets an attempted drop-volley . we are at 3-3 at the change of ends .
it 's a good service game from azarenka . it looks like the break in the previous game has lifted the reigning champion , as she keeps li off the score board against her serve .
morita holds , though williams does n't look like she 's firing on all cylinders just yet . feeling her way into this one .
ivanovic finally gets on the scoreboard in the second set but still trails by an early break of serve .
heavy hitting from bartoli puts stephens under pressure in her first service game , slamming a baseline winner across court to reach deuce . a very positive response from the american starlet though , following a forehand winner with a first ace to ease her way into the match .
kerber fires long and will now face a triple break point herself .
the czech shows no mercy to take a two-game lead in the first set . wozniacki looks uncomfortable and takes her time to adjust the strapping on her foot before the next service game , which should give a better indication as to how freely she can move after that injury .
venus is mixing up her serves to good effect and after two are returned off target by keys , the 18th seed drives down an ace . a love hold is converted when keys is unable to handle a serve to her backhand side .
it 's sharapova to serve first , and she takes the opening two points after errors from williams . however , the russian has problems with her serve , floating a second serve in before conceding a double fault . it 's 30-30 , which soon becomes deuce when sharapova goes long with a backhand . a second double fault gives serena the first break point of the match , before a third gives the american the game . that 's not a good sign ...
azarenka wins the next four points to force ivanovic to serve it out . at the moment ivanovic seems to be guessing right when azarenka has an easy shot every time !
the belarusian is back to her best in that game . more big serves and good net play get her to 40-15 and , despite a double fault , she holds relatively routinely . she 'll face now and must keep attacking the russian 's serve as she has done in every one of kuznetsova 's games so far .
azarenka breaks : hantuchova comes up with two well-placed aces , but she then negates her good work with three forced errors , squandering game point , before being broken to 40 .
williams catches the baseline to go 15-0 ahead , but she then nets a seemingly easy put-away . azarenka is freeing up her shoulders and it pays dividends to bring up two break points . an ace saves the first , and after azarenka goes long on back-to-back points , williams wallops a serve down the middle to take the game .
the brit starts the third comfortably by holding to-15 , can she gain an early break in the second ?
it has happened again . clever smash from radwanska , who instead of power drops it short where errani has no hope of reaching it . then a drop shot from the italian clips the top of the net and to safety for deuce - really skilful shot . yet another drop shot from errani takes her to game point ; again it 's really well disguised . radwanska saves it marvellously by guessing the right way with a volley - i had my savings errani going left there , but she went right and the pole was there . after five deuces radwanska finally claims the game with a solid net winner .
the pole has successfully quelled the pressure from errani and is now getting on top of matters . she is forcing errors with much harder hitting , with a fatal forehand into the net from the italian giving up a second break running .
ivanovic has chances to win one or both of the first two points , but she takes neither and safarova has 30-0. the czech sees her deficit halved when she goes long , but another devastating winner sees her open up two game points . ivanovic shows excellent resilience though , saving both points before surviving a third thanks to a huge forehand from the baseline . she ca n't save the fourth as safarova peppers her with shots from all angles and she is one game away from her first grand slam final .
the errors from robson are n't helping , but erakovic has looked mightily impressive so far , especially on her forehand side . she eases to 40-0 , before gifting robson a point with a double fault . however , she responds with an ace to move three ahead inside 10 minutes .
that 's a poor game from lisicki , radwanska did n't have to do much there .
finally , she gets the breakthrough she probably deserves . she was helped by some really lax play from azarenka , but still trails by a break in this set .
after a couple of error-strewn games from both players , the tennis is starting to flow a little more now , with some good baseline rallies . the change in style seems to suit sharapova , as she forces a couple of wide shots from williams to give herself a break point . williams sends the russian running along the baseline , but the defending champion is able to keep the point alive , and the american fires the ball long to hand sharapova the break .
a double fault gifts morita the break of serve .
the standard of tennis has got marginally better over the past 10 minutes , but the errors are still there , and doi goes long twice in a row to hand kvitova two break points . doi continues to be aggressive , but after hooking a forehand wide of the line , she is just a game away from going out of this year 's tournament .
she nets on the first but takes the second as vika curls a forehand into the tramlines . so hard to pick a winner now .
remarkably , this is kvitova 's 30th three-set match of the year . incredible start . she needed a positive start to the decider , and she gets it , taking the game when doi nets a return .
radwanska has some joy , prevailing from the best rally of the match and striking a clean forehand winner , but on the remaining points , she is helpless as muguruza produces more relentless hitting to move to within a game of a place in the final .
kirilenko holds to 15. she has made 10 first serves so far and won the point on every single occasion . the russian has won just three of seven points behind her second serve .
another brilliant forehand from kvitova moves the 2011 champion 15-0 ahead and that quickly becomes 30-0 following a volley from the middle of the court . bouchard then fails to return a powerful serve as kvitova moves 40-0 ahead , but the czech then double-faults for 40-15. kvitova eventually manages to hold with a stunning forehand .
azarenka holds to 15 thanks to some wayward striking by her opponent .
a couple of errors see the players tied early on , but mladenovic then tries to force it only to go long and concede . vinci chops a poor return wide to bring things to 30-30 , before more dodgy shots from both players eventually bring deuce . some luck at the net gives vinci break point , which she then takes as mladenovic finds the mesh from close range . poor from the youngster , and that could be vital in the outcome of this quarter-final .
errrm , that 's now 12 points in a row for williams as she again holds to love . what a turnaround .
at 30-30 , kirilenko goes for a drop shot , but it drops too early and fails to make it over the net to give williams a break point . a fierce return from williams allows her to convert , and it feels like it 's just a formality for the 15-time grand slam winner now .
call the police , there 's been a robbery on centre court !
she responds with an excellent forehand winner , but that was at 0-40. the damage had already been done and it is compounded with another poor shot into the net .
very comfortable hold from the reigning champ , which will be a worrying sign for kuznetsova 's camp . the world number one is closing in on victory .
she 's a little lucky , but lisicki has broken the radwanska serve and will serve for a place in her first grand slam final .
kirilenko is beginning to move sharapova around the court effectively and the former champion is looking flustered . after getting to 30-0 , the two russians enjoy a stunning exchange that ends with kirilenko putting a forehand into the corner for three game points . she does n't convert the first though - instead , she miscues the ball into the stands where actor alec baldwin is waiting to take the catch ! that mistake disrupts kirilenko and a double fault allows sharapova to get back to deuce , but after creating her fifth game point , kirilenko delivers an absolute screamer of a forehand from the baseline to consolidate the break .
a comfortable hold for the russian . and an important one too .
the door is slightly ajar at 0-15 but ivanovic is made of stern stuff and powers back to 30-15. safarova 's hitting is ruthless though and a forehand winner takes her to within two points of the final . back comes ivanovic with a winner of her own before she confirms the hold with a huge serve down the middle .
kvitova serves well at the start of the game , following up an ace with another powerful delivery , but kvitova hits it straight back with a backhand winner . at deuce , the fifth seed pulls off a stunning cross-court two-handed backhand to bring up advantage , before following it up with another winner on the backhand to seal the game . given some of the errors she 's made during her own service games in the second set , that was a solid effort from the czech .
robson overcooks her forehand , before a couple of excellent backhands from wozniacki bring up two break-point chances . another double-fault gives the dane the lead again .
it 's a cool start to the second set from lisicki . she 's been catching kanepi out all afternoon with her drop shot , and she does it again , helping her to a comfortable hold .
azarenka needs to stop williams 's momentum here , but the game starts badly as the american hits a backhand past her and she hits an unforced error . serena loses the next point to give azarenka hope at 15-30 , before a wild backhand levels the score . a big forehand catches the baseline to give williams a break point , and she takes it as azarenka hits a backhand wide . the former world number one ca n't handle williams in this form .
a forehand winner gets vinci off to the perfect start but pennetta replies with a big serve down the middle . the next two points are shared , but the first mini-break goes to pennetta after vinci drills a forehand long . the world number 43 then does the same off her backhand wing and pennetta is in charge at the change of ends .
and that 's followed by her first ace ! absolutely vital , that hold , for the second seed .
still going with serve this set . both women winning points with power . there 's not much room for breaks or rallies , in truth . there are flashes , though , and it 's certainly high quality tennis .
after the opening two points are shared , bacsinszky controls the next rally before forcing her opponent into the error . the swiss then hits the way to the next two points to leave williams having to serve to remain in the first set .
i think it 's quite rare that radwanska does n't get a point on her opponent 's service game , although she was helped by some poor shots from the chinese in this game . radwanska nets a simple backhand on first break point , but na returns the favour on the second one and first blood the pole .
safarova makes an unforced error to allow ivanovic to get back to 15-15 , before the former world number reaches 30-30 courtesy of a testing drive volley . big point coming up , but what a response from safarova , who fires an ace out wide . the game is secured when ivanovic goes just wide with a return .
finally , robson manages to cash in a break point , and takes a two-game lead in the second set . kvitova is still struggling to get her first serve in , giving robson a greater chance to return .
williams consolidates the break with little trouble .

break back ! the double faults come back to haunt sharapova as a first brings up a break point for azarenka before a second hands the world number one the break . a route back into this one for the belarusian ?
this could be a decisive break . it took her four attemps , but finally she steps into a big forehand winner to get her nose ahead in the set . her power is just too much at times .
pretty tentative movement at the baseline from wozniacki , who slams a forehand into the net to fall 15-30 behind on serve . cetkovska retains her focus to earn two break points , with simple returns over the net enough to force errors from her stricken opponent . all to easy for the czech as she earns a double break .
williams comes out on top of a badminton-style exchange of volleys , before sharapova catches her out with a delicate drop shot . williams finds another gear to take the game , and sharapova will serve for the match again .
another game full of deuces and advantages for azarenka finally sees her take it and it needed a return into the net from her opponent to make it happen . looking likely to be a tie break this first set .
she 's pretty much cruising now . a comfortable service hold from her and she 's one game away from a place in the second week of wimbledon . it has not been easy , however .
williams appears to be back in the driving seat now . three game points are created in next to no time before she edges ahead with her 11th ace of a pulsating encounter .

pennetta is starting to look really solid during her service games , following up a cross-court backhand with a forehand winner down the sideline on her way to a 40-15 lead , before kvitova finds the net with her backhand , keeping the set on serve . the longer the set goes on , the more comfortable the italian looks , despite having played more tennis at this year 's us open than her opponent .
serena has won all 17 points on her first serve today , which soon becomes 18 with a serve out wide . the american then adjusts well at the net to put away a volley , and her sixth ace of the match brings up two game points . the world number one 's first serve continues to be mightily impressive and another serve is n't return and she moves one game away from the second round .

sharapova looks under real pressure at 15-15 , but three consecutive errors from knapp 's forehand hand the russian a priceless hold to 15 .

the two keep at it with the heavy hitting before azarenka eventually holds . all eyes on sharapova now as she steps up to serve .
lisicki tries too hard to wrap the match up in this game , putting for too much on the ball during her returns to give kanepi a 40-0 lead . however , she turns back to her drop shot , which has been incredibly successful this afternoon , to keep herself in the game . some solid groundstrokes from lisicki have her opponent on the defensive , and the estonian hits the net before blasting the ball long to bring up deuce , but some big serves from kanepi allow her to hold . lisicki will now serve for a place in the last four .
double break ! deary me , what a limp performance this is from ivanovic . she 's broken again and now bouchard will serve for the match and a place in round three of wimbledon .

at 30-30 , the pair get in to a lengthy rally . li loops the ball high , and azarenka must have lost track of it along the way as she mis-hits it , and it finds the net to give the sixth seed a break point . a wide ball on the next point takes the game to deuce though , before azarenka lands a stunning forehand stroke just inside the sideline . a well-placed serve from the reigning champion is too good for li to return , and the world number one if just one game away from keeping the title .
cirstea is just one game from a place in the second round now , breezing through another service game to leave watson serving to stay in the match .
that 's a second hold in this set from 0-30 for radwanska and it 's not the pole 's good play that 's doing it , more li 's inconsistency .

no problems on her own serve either for pironkova , who holds relatively comfortably to consolidate the break . how can the world number four respond to this ?

kvitova manages to get through a service game without facing a break point as pennetta struggles to get her returns back in , before watching a kvitova forehand fly past her to secure the game for the fifth seed . while kvitova has n't looked settled at all , the longer this match goes on , it is likely to play into kvitova 's hands , as she 's spent less time on court reaching this stage , and unlike pennetta has n't been involved in the doubles .
vandeweghe makes a double fault at the start of the game as it looks like she might be starting to feel the pressure , but she quickly puts the behind her , timing her groundstrokes to perfection to take a 40-15 lead . a run of unforced errors from the american get the game back to deuce though , before sharapova hits some solid forehands from the back of the court to bring up advantage , but she forces the ball slightly long to miss out on the break point . vandeweghe gets the advantage when the fourth seed hits another ball long , and she escapes with her serve intact after a big serve into sharapova 's body . the points were noticeably longer in that game , with more rallies starting to feature in this contest .

lisicki finally holds as kerber sends a backhand lob past the baseline .

there 's an angry look on the face of sharapova after she fails to convert break point , allowing knapp to hold .
robson just spurns a chance to take charge of the first set , with kanepi going back to basics behind a first serve to get the hard-fought hold . the brit is clearly happy to exchange with her powerful opponent at the baseline though , which does well for a match full of attacking intent .
indeed she does break back ! we 're with serve again , but not really if that makes sense !
williams double faults at 40-15 after being called for a foot fault but consolidates the break on the next as lisicki hits out on the return .
brilliant point as radwanska defends superbly to get back in the rally , but errani is too strong with a forehand that the pole can not return . that said , errani has looked very suspect with her smash today - she 's either missed or passed it right back to radwanska with every one so far . she then hits to net to hand radwanska two break points , but saves the first with a whipped backhand past the advancing pole . the second is saved with an aggressive net point , finishing with a simple forehand . neither player is giving everything up as another wonderful net point is finished with a drop volley from the italian and she eventually holds an important game - the longest of the match at 10 minutes .
vinci comes through with a hold to 30 but you feel as though this match belongs to pennetta providing that she shows a little more aggression . she is currently too tentative when vinci begins to slice the ball .
sharapova commits another double fault but it comes at 40-0 and she holds for the third game in succession with a serve out wide . despite the one-sided nature of the first set , this is competitive now .
the tennis is not of a particularly high quality at the moment . stephens holds serve comfortably , but there 's something of a lack of urgency . stephens does n't seem to want to hammer the nail into the coffin of her compatriot just yet , and has taken the foot off the gas a bit .
really good hold from pironkova after being 0-40 down . that 's encouraging fighting spirit at the start of the deciding set .
kvitova is on the hunt early on in the game , clearly boosted after saving break points in the previous game . a forehand winner from the czech is followed by a missed effort out wide from the 26th seed , giving her opponent a 40-15 lead , but more unforced errors from the two-time grand slam champion let pennetta back in . she serves well to force a wayward return from kvitova , before getting the better in a baseline exchange with the fifth seed to seal the game .
if it can go wrong for williams at the moment , then it is doing . after dropping her first set of the tournament and tweaking her ankle , williams has to battle with her hair coming loose ! it 's yet another irritation for the world number one . kuznetsova takes advantage of her opponents diminishing confidence to force another break point , but she gets too aggressive with her return to take the game to deuce . williams targets her shots to the kuznetsova backhand , knowing that she has been struggling against her forehand , to win a 15-stroke rally . the top seed fails to read kuznetsova 's backhand , and is left rooted to the spot as the russian brings up another break point , but she saves it yet again . williams eventually forces advantage , and is able to seal the game when kuznetsova loses her footing and hits the deck .
sharapova leaves nothing to chance by hitting her way to 30-0 but back comes williams , who unleashes an unstoppable backhand into the corner . the russian earns two game points , but serena is relentless , powering the ball with authority to reach deuce . a double fault gives williams a match point , but the five-time winner somehow misses with a forehand . sharapova eventually holds , but williams will now serve for a place in the final .
it 's a gift . kuznetsova double faults and she really has taken her foot off the pedal in this set . she 's allowed wozniacki back in rather than the dane playing her way back in . wozniacki has taken her chances , though . all credit to her .
safarova is pumped after that last game , and ivanovic feels the pressure in committing a double fault to start the game . that 's followed with a baseline winner before ivanovic goes long with a forehand . safarova has three break points and this would be huge in the context of the match . the first is saved but on the second , ivanovic slices wide and safarova has the advantage .
it 's a comfortable hold for radwanska , who drops just one point on the way to the opening game . that 's just what she will have wanted . i 'm anticipating either a close match with errani winning , or a radwanska blowout . we 'll see , as she serves for the first time .
no danger from azarenka of breaking back at the moment as ivanovic breezes through that game to 15 to edge within a game of the opening set . we 've played half an hour of tennis on ashe .
superb way to hold ! serena does well to get back a big lisicki serve and her return just dips over the net . lisicki has to go for broke and finds the corner with a down-the-line backhand .
kirilenko drills a stunning backhand winner down the line to take the opening point , but sharapova begins to display her superior power to get to 30-15. what 's been impressive from kirilenko so far is that she is getting herself into most of the rallies and it 's seemingly making sharapova doubt herself . a double fault and a forehand error give kirilenko break point and after she makes up a lot of ground at the back of the court , sharapova blazes a forehand long and it 's kirilenko who strikes first !
so , we have a final set shoot-out ! williams serves first , and she starts positively with a big serve and a booming backhand to go 40-0 up . a wild forehand gives azarenka a point , but williams holds on to win the game .
garcia makes a brilliant return at the start of the game as she seems to be adapting to williams ' serve , but the american finds another gear , quickly wrapping the game up with two aces .
sharapova makes a couple of excellent returns to take a 30-15 lead in the game , but misjudges a second serve from the american to keep her opponent in the game , before a low forehand from the fourth seed allows vandeweghe to keep the set on serve .
the spaniard applies lots of pressure early on and she cruises through to a 40-15 lead as bacsinszky makes far too many errors on the return . muguruza seals the game when her opponent can only force her backhand attempt straight into the net .
great early showing from jankovic , who makes sharapova work for it and earns two break points . however , the defending champion hit two massive forehands on the way to rescuing deuce . the two trades blows in the deuce , with jankovic possessing an advantage on four occasions , only for sharapova to respond . however , she secured the first game after encouraging sharapova to slam the ball out of play .
robson takes the first two points , the second of which is her fourth ace , but an impressive backhand volley keeps erakovic in the game . however , she then makes a glaring error when attempting a drop shot , and robson takes the game when her opponent ca n't handle her power from the baseline . this is the first time that robson has been ahead in the match .
with makarova going wide with the final point for another very comfortable sharapova service game .
at 15-30 , vinci gets a good look at a second serve but she goes for too much and it flies out . let off for pennetta . she makes the most of the second one , though , and it 's break point for vinci . it goes begging , but she has a second after tying up her opponent at the net . pennetta looks tentative and vinci takes advantage , smashing the ball into the corner and she is back in this set .
williams is furious with herself when she sends a backhand long . muguruza is similarly frustrated as she hits a simple volley too hard . a shout of approval from williams follows a rally when she finally seemed to be dictating the tempo . muguruza then misses the line by about an inch to gift her opponent two break points . the spaniard responds by wrong-footing the top seed with a superb backhand , but she hits a forehand long to give williams the game . was that the turning point ?
keys hits two shots into the net to give venus the lead but it 's the points either side of 15-30 that suggest that keys is n't ready to give up on this . she 's continuing to go for broke with her forehand and it gets her an imperative hold .
very solid from errani , who does n't allow radwanska a look in there and she takes us to a tie-break .
three unforced errors cost kvitova badly as pennetta brings up two break points , returning excellently from the back of the court . kvitova tries to responds , hitting an excellent backhand winner , but she looks exhausted as she gets ready for the next point , which ends in a long forehand from the fifth seed . it 's advantage pennetta in the deciding set .
incredible . just when it appeared that halep was on her way to levelling the match , she produces a shocker of a service game that ends with a double fault . in all fairness , pennetta did contribute with some heavy hitting from the back of the court but that was poor from the second seed .
a love hold to start the second for li . the perfect way to get over the opening set .
venus challenges a call on first serve and it 's successful . has the tide turned ?
a challenge arrives from halep early in the game , but the technology proves the azarenka serve clipped the line . halep is handed a point with a double fault , before sending a backhand long on the stretch . azarenka secures the hold to 15 to stay ahead . good response from the belarussian .
it 's an excellent start from ivanovic , who holds to 15 with the help of a baseline winner and an ace .
into a tie-break we go as li holds to 15. i 'm backing radwanska here ...
radwanska comes up short when she pushes far too long to put keys ahead at 30-15 , but the american ca n't hold on as she fires beyond the baseline at 30-30. radwanska misses one horribly to give keys break point , but the youngsters drops it by hitting straight into the net . the polish star eventually holds out on her serve as keys falters on the backhand .

perfect response from bartoli , who is now just one game away from taking her first ever set of sharapova .
makarova continues her habit of unforced errors as she overhits her forehand once again in this match . she responds well as she manoeuvres the number two seed around the court , which brings the error from sharapova as she tries to hit down the line . both players exchange excellent tennis shots in the next two points as makarova finds a winner , but sharapova follows suit with a forehand down the line . raw power from sharapova overwhelms her compatriot as she blasts a forehand across the court , but a smash from the 10th seed levels the game . a solid serve down the 't ' and an error from the 2008 champion secure an important hold from makarova , and she desperately needed it .
safarova also begins well to race to 30-0 but a couple of mistakes let in ivanovic at 30-30. the former world number one looks focused at the start of this contest and she forces the error out of safarova to earn break point . it 's saved with an ace but ivanovic creates a second chance with a thunderous forehand down the line . safarova looks in charge of the next rally but ivanovic comes up with an awkward backhand that safarova volleys wide .
stosur finally comes out on top with what you would describe a champion 's reaction ! robson now serving to stay in the set .

keys has had a quick word with the umpire - maybe she needs the trainer ? she shows no weakness in advancing into a 30-0 lead but after netting for 30-30 , she grimaces and clutches her left thigh . she 's really struggling and venus seals the double break . this is n't looking good ...
serena williams wins the us open !
it 's a nervy start from the chinese player as she opens with a double fault . a couple of good ground strokes help get back in to the game , but azarenka steps it up , moving in to the net for an aggressive volley before a long ball from li hands the belarusian the first game .
lisicki makes a brilliant return to take the opening point of the match , before a big serve from the estonian levels the scores . kanepi follows it up with a double fault . a strong forehand allows kanepi to edge ahead , but she gets caught out while looking to volley , giving the german the chance to lob the ball over her and bring up deuce . on the fourth deuce of the game , lisicki makes a stunning forehand down the sideline to bring up the first break point of the match , and she gets it with kanepi smashing her forehand into the net . both players using a great variety of shots early in this match .
the serve was there to be hit , but vesnina slams the ball into the net ! azarenka has taken a bit off the serve in order to , well , get it in play . the defending champ goes on to close out the game .

again kvitova starts well as bouchard fires a forehand long for 0-15 , before netting to hand kvitova 0-30. bouchard moves onto the board in the next point when kvitova nets from the baseline , but bouchard then fails to return for 15-40. the canadian starves off the first break point , but kvitova takes the second when bouchard slices long of the baseline .
the early danger signs are there when williams eases into a 0-30 lead but bacsinszky remains composed to get to deuce . she then finds her way to game point before williams makes a glaring forehand error to allow the swiss to get on the board .
stephens makes the breakthrough at the third attempt . robson was on the back foot in the rally and was clinging on . she eventually put too much into a forehand to cede the early ground .
the difference in this set is that doi is coming out on top in the longer rallies . that happens once more at 15-15 , before kvitova throws in a double fault to hand her opponent two break points , which she takes when the czech player goes wide .
a welcome love game for the former finalist , putting nice variety behind a noticeably different service action . stephens looked happy to stay defensive at the baseline in that game , perhaps just taking her foot of the pedal after making her opening hold .
after both players trade errors , muguruza explodes into life to put away a second-serve return for 15-30. another imposing point see her drill home a drive volley for two break points before a phenomenal defensive lob is followed by a winner off the ground . is that the decisive game of the set and match ?

much more like it under pressure from the brit , serving a superb ace at break-point down . a measured forehand down the line is followed by some stern baseline defence , securing a hold the 19-year-old desperately needed .
robson gets a break back . she was far more proactive in that game , and cut down on the errors that have plagued her early in this set . if she can hold now then she 's back within touching distance .
like yesterday , it has taken vinci 's variety some time to take effect but now it has , she looks the better of the two players . a couple of winners help her to three game points but pennetta replies with a blistering return . she follows that with a volley on the stretch , before vinci slices a backhand into the net . has the tide turned ? nope , not quite . vinci pulls through after pennetta goes long and she has guaranteed herself a tie-break .

this is just phenomenal serving from williams , who hits three aces and a vicious winner . the american looks destined to face maria sharapova on thursday , unless azarenka can find a miracle .
daniilidou is having minor success at the net - certainly more than from the baseline . but azarenka again breaks comfortably with another double fault to finish the game off .
what a response to losing a monstrous opening rally . from 15-0 down , sharapova rallies to win the game and won it with a lovely drop shot that forced jankovic to the net , which left sharapova on hand to hammer the backhand into space .

set sharapova : the russian holds to 15 to take the opening set inside 28 minutes .

break back ! radwanska takes her fourth chance by slicing to the net and lisicki is unable to make her lob dip in . back on serve , what drama !

kvitova continues to make errors on her own serve , allowing pennetta to take the game to 30-30. she comes inside the baseline looking to replicate the forehands that won her the previous game , but misses the baseline to bring up another break point for pennetta , but it 's swiftly saved with an ace . the fifth seed finds her forehand to get advantage , but double faults on the next point to keep the italian in the game . kvitova finds her focus though , following up a forehand winner with a tidy backhand down the line to hold serve .

danger signs for williams at 0-15 , but azarenka ca n't take advantage , and she sends a second serve return long of the baseline . she keeps herself in the game though , forcing williams to frame the ball for 30-30. the american moves to game point , but concedes the softest of double faults . that 's pure guts from williams . after a foot-fault is called after an ace , she responds with a big forehand winner . what a drop shot ! azarenka slices the ball from the back of the court which drops inches over the net . wow , this match is getting good . two more winners paint the lines , but williams holds firm to hold with an ace .
lisicki plays well from the back of the court , but kanepi is able to defend well , with the game heading the deuce . a long forehand from the estonian gives the 23rd seed advantage . she misses her first serve , but tries a risky second serve , and gets an ace .

a quite incredible implosion from kvitova shows no sign of letting up , with yet another double fault contributing to makarova 's fourth successive break of serve . full credit to the russia , she has maximised her chances and now must be favourite to progress tonight .
power from vinci this time as she returns mladenovic 's serve back down the line to open the scores , but france 's hopeful comes back into it when vinci falls flat on her forehand . mladenovic goes ahead with an ace that requires a challenge , only for the youngster to shoot herself in the foot with a double fault . vinci can not return from deep next up , leaving mladenovic to close out an important hold when another italian return finds the net .
a huge moment in the game as radwanska breaks . radwanska hits back at keys with a forehand winner and the pressure looks to tell on the 20-year-old as she double faults to hand the pole a 30-0 lead . the 26-year-old wastes her momentum with a loose forehand , but then plays the point of her match to earn two break points as she somehow lunges to lob the american at the net despite her powerful backhand , and then wins the point with a delicate slice across court . radwanska has keys on the back foot for the first break , but the american capitalises on a mistake with an overhead smash to save one point . however , keys commits a forehand error to hand the break to the pole . a huge moment in the game and keys had looked so composed on her serve before that game .

halep has second thoughts about a challenge when azarenka finds the line with an unstoppable forehand , and hopes of a response from the belarusian are raised when she watches her rival send a forehand of her own wide . the second seed hits back with a winner before azarenka finds the net to make it 30-30. a couple of superb ground strokes from halep hit the perfect length and azarenka is unable to keep her response from drifting long . however , a second serve is just far too inviting for azarenka to turn down as she delivers a return winner to get to deuce . halep edges ahead when her fastest serve of the match is sent back at the net . azarenka gets another second serve to attack , but she hits the backhand wide and halep is one game away from the semi-finals .
despite having five chances to break ivanovic still ca n't find a way to make it count as radwanska survives to earn a vital hold and stay firmly in control of the second set .
it looks like missing out on the break in the previous game has effected li , as she serves her first double fault of the match , immediately followed by a second , to give azarenka two break points . she wastes the first with a wide shot , and hits the net on the next , allowing li back in to the game at deuce . the misses seem to lift li , who takes advantage with a superb shot down the sideline , following up with another to take the game . both players are having hot and cold spells at the minute .

it 's important that cibulkova finds a way to hold in this game but despite moving 30-15 ahead , serena 's power is on show again as she leathers a forehand return into the opposite corner of the court . cibulkova then goes long from the baseline to concede the double break and it 's one-way traffic on the rod laver arena .

halep goes shot-for-shot with her rival from the baseline and , surprisingly , beats her for power to get to 15-15 early in the game . a couple of superb strokes from azarenka move her back ahead as she sends halep wide before going in the opposite direction with the winner . halep is then too good with the return of a second serve , and the angle of the follow-up forehand is perfect as she pulls level again . a fine rally brings the best out of both players , but halep blinks first by going wide with a forehand on the stretch . halep hits back with some brilliant forehands and a winner is followed by a big fist pump from the romanian . azarenka delivers a double fault at the worst possible time to hand break point to halep , who wastes the opportunity by sending a miscued backhand wide . an unforced error brings up a second break point and halep capitalises when azarenka finishes a long rally by going with wide with the backhand . huge moment in the match . can halep hold her nerve ?
routine hold from azarenka to start the second set . one mistake by going long with a backhand , but otherwise very little stephens resistance .
maybe a few nerves creeping in for williams . kirilenko takes the game to deuce , before williams finds a big serve to get advantage , but then has her first double fault of the match . she responds well with her first ace of the set .
vandeweghe dictates the longest rally of the match so far with a series of well-timed backhands , before coming into the net to wrap it up with a volley . the russian gets involved in the net herself on the next point though to level the game . sharapova manages to edge ahead as the american slices a return wide , before hitting the ball into the net on the next point to keep the early stages of this set on serve .
li moves brilliantly behind the baseline , firing a forehand past her opponent . she comes into the net for an overhead volley , but she takes the ball to early and smashes the ball well wide . her forehand clips the net , but still manages to land on the sideline and she takes the game when vinci forces the ball wide .
the end looks near for doi . she dumps a baseline shot into the net , and although a superb lob reduces the deficit to 15-30 , she shows too much aggression and make another error . she saves the first break point , but kvitova steps in to convert a forehand to seal the break to move into a 4-0 lead .
at 15-15 , williams gets lucky with a net cord to get to 30-15 , before vinci nets a return off a well-direct first serve . the game is sealed with a serve down the middle and she is back on track .
a love game for ivanovic here , and she 's looking more than comfortable on serve . can jankovic muster anything to haul herself back in this match ?
at 15-15 , vinci produces one of her biggest serves of the match to force serena to go long . where has that been all match ? however , williams turns thing around to bring up a break point , but the american squanders it , miscuing a relatively easy forehand . vinci holds with some aggressive play of her own and she is one away from taking this match into a decider . i did n't think i would be writing that .
unforced errors cost robson , as she finds the net on more than one occasion to hand the break straight back to kvitova .
it 's a comfortable first service game for the world number 46. her first two serves are returned wide by cirstea , before watson secures the first ace of the match . the brit has a powerful serve , and it looks like it could cause the romanian some problems on the return .
there 's so much pressure on vinci to make her first serve because she knows what is coming if she does n't . vinci creates three game points , but the problems start when she sees the line . williams attacks and gets back to 40-30 , but she dumps a forehand into the net to allow her opponent to restore parity . good hold .
good start to the game for the 19-year-old as she powers a backhand past serena to take the lead , while the number one seed slams her next stroke into the net . the 33-year-old battles back with a strong forehand down the line , and then an ace to tie the scores . however , a loose forehand to the back of the court drops out and then serena slams a backhand into the net to hand keys a break in the first game .
it 's a welcome hold for jankovic , but one she was made to work hard for again . radwanska will now serve for the set .
a much , much better service game for keys . she was on top from the start and forced the error from radwanska to take it . perhaps this one will go to a tie-break - the last set was the same , but the pole took a late break .
however , the pole responds and wraps up her service game with a marvellous drop shot that keys can not dream of reaching .
halep is making some brilliant returns , making a couple of flawless forehand winners to give herself a break point , but a change up in pace on the serve from azarenka takes the game to deuce . the world number two picks out the sideline with another well-struck forehand to give herself another chance though , but this time slices her backhand into the net . a couple more chances for halep to get the break come and go before a fifth break point is converted by the romanian , with azarenka forcing her forehand just long .
and break she does as vika misfires with a forehand . one thing ivanovic is doing very well at the moment is looping the ball with less pace when she 's on the defensive , making it harder for azarenka to move her out of position quickly .
just as i begin to doubt makarova 's chances it all goes horribly wrong for kvitova on serve . two successive double faults start the problems , with the russian attacking a sloppy second serve to earn a break to love . that came completely out of the blue , but can that be the start of a revival in the second set .
it 's errani 's turn for a delightful lob as she clips the line with radwanska advancing . radwanska is now just playing baseline , accurate tennis and at the moment it 's working . that said , errani comes to the net to win an inside-out forehand to bring us to deuce , and takes the game when radwanska slaps long ! errani will serve for the match .
initially brilliant from radwanska . she plops two smashes straight at errani , but wins the point on a very difficult stretching backhand lob at the net . however , some poor shot selection gives errani two break points . the first is saved with a fine forehand winner at the net , but she nets herself the point later and we 're suddenly back with serve .
the pole forces lisicki to serve out the set by holding to 30. lisicki 's first serve is going in 68 % of the time and if she keeps that up then it 'll be hard for radwanska to break . lisicki has lost just one of the 15 points when she 's got her first serve in .
solid start from keys as she races into a 40-0 lead due to accuracy off her serve which puts the pole under pressure . an unforced error hands the pole a point and a way back into the game , but she then goes wide with a volley at the net to give the first game to the 20-year-old .
big hold for azarenka , who secures her second service game with a precise ace that skids off the t .
a couple of tame second serves from wozniacki are quickly punished as falls 15-40 behind , with a forehand winner crashing off the net . early chance here for the czech qualifier with two break points and she takes advantage quickly , showing aggression to finish a relatively easy point with power at the baseline .
robson sinks to her knees as she misses a simple backhand , still on serve in the breaker .
she 's was starting to look a bit more confident , li . she looks to be controlling that service game , but a fightback from her opponent gets it back to deuce . then zakopalova gains advantage but a great li forehand forces her into the error and then finally wraps up the hold . something has to give soon and it looks more likely to come from li .
halep continues to struggle as he misses the court on a simple forehand with the russian again on the back foot . better tennis from the third seed as he hits a deep backhand onto the feet of makarova who ca n't return it , while her forehand clicks into gear with a rapid return right down the line . halep earns two break points with another fine shot on her backhand , but a solid serve and a miscue from the romanian brings deuce . however , halep earns a break back with a solid strike and an error from makarova on her forehand .
break back ! despite the break , cornet looks like she has no confidence , and williams cashes in , placing the ball all around the court and leveling the set .
game and set sharapova ! the champion is level . sharapova storms to a 40-0 lead and has three set points to use up . she levels up the match after jankovic 's return hits the net . we 'll have one final serve in this quarter-final clash .
doi finally gets a bit of luck , when the ball strikes the top of the net and drops over . her opponent then goes long twice in succession to hand doi three game points , before the japanese player concedes a double fault . a return winner takes kvitova to 40-30 , but doi responds with her first ace of the match to remain in the set .
the support for sharapova has increased - the fans do n't want to see this end early and i do n't blame them . the russian goes 0-15 ahead but serena responds with three big first serves . sharapova bursts into life with a backhand return winner but another huge delivery from the american seals the game .
first one saved .
for a third game in a row on kvitova 's serve , pennetta brings up a break point , hitting a string of steady shots from the baseline , eventually forcing a long forehand from her opponent . however , kvitova survives as a low backhand from the italian fails to clear the net . pennetta finds the net again on the next point , before a long return allows the czech to hold serve . kvitova certainly has n't played her best tennis in her first three service games , but she 's doing just enough to stay with her opponent .
just as the start of the last set , kerber is not offering much resistance to the makarova serve . she gets a return in but slices into the net when advancing , a really poor shot .
break back ! she 's got it , again dominating radwanska from the baseline . aggy loves throwing up a high ball to challenge her opponent but again li is confident enough to drive-volley the ball out of the air for a winner and we 're back on serve in the second .
a baseline from bacsinszky tells williams that she has settled into this match , but at 30-15 , she gets over ambitious with a drop shot and the world number one is back to 30-30. she holds her nerve though as she crushes a forehand winner and an ace to take the game .
li does throw it away and the slovakian breaks right back to take is into a breaker . this could go either way , but the momentum i feel is with cibulkova .
two stunning winners take muguruza to 15-30 , but she goes for too much on the next return which goes long . radwanska holds firm to take the next two points to hold , and this is beginning to feel like a different match . how will muguruza cope with having to retreat for the first time in the match ?
they 're heavy hitters these two and we 're still on serve as clijsters holds .
i get the impression that williams is slightly perturbed . she powers a backhand winner past azarenka , before her opponets commits her fifth double fault . a second serve barely reaches williams , and the american gives it the treatment to bring up three break points . azarenka survives a hawkeye challenge by a millimetre and she is soon back at 30-40 after williams shanks a backhand . williams has the break though , after azarenka disappointingly dumps a shot into the net ! williams will return to serve for the championship for a second time .
some big returns from li bring up three break points against azarenka 's serve . the sixth seed sends a backhand long , before sealing the break with a superb backhand down the sideline , which left azarenka rooted to the spot .
another very , very close wide call goes against sharapova . makarova holds serve , but only because of those three near misses . sharapova will serve for the match .
erakovic needs to take a step back , and compose herself . she 's under a barrage from robson right now . she edges 30-0 ahead , but a forehand error and a double fault bring robson back to 30-30. erakovic 's forehand has gone missing , and another goes long for break point to robson . what a reply though , a super ace out wide and we are at deuce . she ca n't hold off robson 's power though , who forces erakovic into two more mistakes , and she takes the initiative in the set .
lisicki saves the first by tracking down radwanska 's volley before aggie manages to hold by hitting a first serve that lisicki returns long . radwanska now one game away from her second-straight wimbledon final .
almost 10 minutes that game took . serena comes through with two mighty serves and this match is on course to be a cracker .
stephens replies in kind with two easy points to consolidate the break . she 's in front early in this match !
game , set & match ! serving for a place in the semis , vinci starts strongly with a serve that forces a tame return from mladenovic . it 's soon 30-0 when the frenchwoman crunches another into the net . some slight resistance is offered by the youngster at 30-15 , who follows it up with something bigger deep that does for vinci . mladenovic comes up short by pumping her next return wide , only to respond with a massive forehand winner . a predictable error at the vital moment from mladenovic gives vinci another chance to close the game , which eventually happens as the french player turns a return into the net . vinci is through ...
azarenka comes into the net to try to get herself going in this set , but double faults on the following point . she plays an excellent backhand on the next point , which the stretching second seed gets her racquet to , but ca n't get it back in play , while halep misses her next return to give azarenka the game . the romanian will serve for the set next though .
again the czech goes wide on break point , but li does n't want to capitalise when she has her own advantage and skews a shot into the stands . however , she finally finishes it with an ace .
muguruza has started this final brilliantly , but she is frustrated with herself having missed a second-serve return to move to 0-40. serena fires back to reach 30-30 before another huge serve earns her game point . the hold is complete when the spaniard goes for too much with a return .
out of nowhere , williams drops to 0-30 after two unforced errors before she remains competitive with an ace down the middle . bacsinszky feels hard done by when she 's on the wrong end of a questionable line call , but she shakes it over to drill a backhand winner down the line to earn a break point . williams saves it , as well as denying bacsinszky on four more occasions , but the swiss is unnerved and after middling a backhand return , she benefits from a mistake from williams to break through .
robson ca n't do anything about the first two points , but a wild forehand from her opponent gives her an opening to get into the game . however , the door is slammed firmly shut with an ace , before robson puts too much fizz on a return .
keys starts well with a well worked winner as she manoeuvres williams across the court before firing a forehand into the corner . the duo exchange errors on the next two points , but williams ups the ante to take a game point with an outstanding lob to the back of the court . the 19-year-old shows her spirit with a powerful backhand down the line , but a couple of loose strokes from keys hand the game to the world number one .
she only needs one of them as an error from radwanska gives up her service game to love . the last time that happened she broke right back , though . as it stands errani is racing to the semis .
sharapova is looking really sharp on the return at the start of this game , coming inside the baseline to take the ball early , clinching the opening couple of points . a long forehand from vandeweghe gives the russian a break point , and she takes the game when a lengthy exchange from the baseline results in the american firing her backhand into the net .
sharapova 's excellent service game in the match continues with the first point as he nails her shot down the 't ' , while she then works bouchard around the court to produce an error , and then a winner with her backhand into the corner . the 20-year-old shows some fight as sharapova finds the net and finds a winner on her forehand . however , the russian seals the set as bouchard commits an unforced error into the net .
a very big hold here for williams . she fends off that break point to tie up this final set . more importantly , she 's starting to find some power with her serve and net shots .
pennetta shakes off the disappointment of the previous game with a winner , but halep is relentless right now and crushes a forehand winner and serve out wide to reach two game points . the game is sealed with a stunning backhand winner down the line which is celebrated with a fist pump . she 's starting to look like the second best player in the world .
watson is 0-30 up but does n't attack the second serve well enough on the next point . watson gets a break point with a fine pass at the feet of her opponent that is returned into the net but goes wide returning a second serve . she had to to better there . after a series of deuces radwanska eventually manages to hold with an unbelievable forehand winner .
after the opening two points are shared , pennetta ups the ante off the ground but with mixed results with her forehand . at 30-30 , vinci crushes a forehand winner into the corner for game point and it 's taken when pennetta makes the unforced error .
despite that , the champion takes the game and requires just one more now for a place in the semi-finals .
the tide has certainly turned . muguruza is struggling to cause the same problems for williams , who shows that her serve is improving by firing down a couple of aces . it 's a comfortable hold , and that 's exactly what the american needs now .
mladenovic opens up the second set , only to be undone by great placement from the italian at 15-15. the frenchwoman responds with a crunching forehand across the court that has vinci scrambling , although a poor follow up wide down the line draws vinci back level . mladenovic holds her nerve , however , after a backhand winner and a cheap return from her opponent .
vinci takes the opening point , but a double fault and a winner from williams sees the american reach 15-30. the world number one then steps into a second-serve return and vinci has no answer . it 's two break points to williams , but she misses out on the first , dumping a return into the net . should have made it . she converts the second , though , quite brilliantly . a tense point ends with serena drilling a drive volley behind her opponent and she has the break .
it 's important here for venus to not offer any more encouragement to her opponent but when an unforced error hands keys 0-30 , the danger signs are there for the 18th seed . she finds a way to fight back , though , through a mixture of solid first serves and keys only finding the net .
another groundstroke into the net from lisicki and that 's a dream start for bartoli . she takes the opening set in just half an hour .
keys has a fine start to the game with a solid forehand to the back of the court , but serena comes roaring back to produce the error from the 19-year-old . keys edges ahead again , only to lose the next two points in a row to stare down the barrel at match point . the serve to stay in the match is excellent from 19-year-old as she clips the line , but williams earns another with a ferocious backhand , which completely wrong foots her opponent . keys battles back with another exceptional ace down the middle of the court , but the number one seed finds a backhand winner again . the 19-year-old continues to refuse to face her fate as she saves match point five more times , before taking the game on an error from williams .
mladenovic turns the screw as she goes 40-15 up , but vinci battles back to 40-30. mladenovic finally takes the game , break set with a wonderful hook across the face of the court . can the young frenchwoman do this ? a third set might wear on that injury a little ...
knapp breaks back ! the italian hits a backhand winner and , after sharapova fails to convert three match points , we are all level again . incredible .
well , maybe not . the muguruza of old has returned , pummelling two huge winners to earn three break points . radwanska saves the first , but on the second , she sprays a forehand wide of the line .
a simple hold for azarenka puts the world number one back in front . who 's gon na crack first ?
azarenka saves a break back point before hitting a rare forehand winner to hold . she 's just a game away now . serena serving to stay in this final .
she 's starting to find her rhythm ! sharapova is hitting some fabulous hits in this game and seems to be finding the right side of the line . a powerful winner earns her a break point , before forcing jankovic to find the net for 2-0 .
the deciding set continues with another comfortable hold as halep delights the crowd by clipping the line with a stunning backhand down the line . azarenka manages to punish a second serve with a powerful winner , but another backhand follows from the second seed as halep holds to 15 .
i make that kuznetsova 's most comfortable service game of the match . the pressure is now on azarenka to serve to stay in the set .
break back ! just as it looks like kvitova might be starting to take control of the match , the errors creep back in as she sends a forehand long before clattering a volley into the net , while a wayward forehand brings up three break points for pennetta , which the italian claims with an excellent backhand .
a first ace from robson up the middle , who has definitely worked hard on that service action in the last few months . kanepi then blasts a pair of forehands well past the baseline , allowing the brit to claim another comfortable hold .
sure enough , after the minor scare normal service is resumed . sharapova takes the game and is one away from another dominant victory .
kerber holds the opening game . a good start .
radwanska wins the game with her first point in a comfortable hold .
like the opening set , ivanovic has started off the more impressive of the two and the errors are beginning to come from safarova . she misses out on two game points before ivanovic earns a break point with a beautiful shot off the ground . that goes begging though , as does a second opening , and safarova comes through with the hold .
well it looked like errani was on top , but radwanska again turns it up for a game and breaks straight back . neither player is able to hold their serve at the moment and we could be heading for a breaker .
oh dear , this one could get away from ivanovic very , very quickly if she carries on like this . it 's a love-break for vika as the serb nets a short forehand .
the russian brings up the break point with a sizzling backhand before azarenka hits wide . the world number one is on real trouble now . staggering to think that 's she hit only the one winner so far .
quick hold for the world number one . she served up her sixth double fault in that game , but she gets it on the board .
two muguruza errors hand radwanska some breathing space at 30-0 , and the pole completes a much-needed love hold with a backhand volley and a smash .
just as williams was doing earlier , muguruza is dominating against the second serve . another powerful winner makes it 15-15 early in the game . williams hits back with an ace , before losing another point on the second serve . another ace follows , as does a williams error . deuce . incredibly , it 's muguruza who is taking charge in the longer rallies . williams struggles to deal with the power of muguruza 's ground strokes , and the spaniard has a break point . she wo n't stop there . williams , on the stretch , hits a forehand wide . muguruza has a double break .
robson holds to love . kirilenko looks powerless to stop the fired-up brit right now . one feels that if she fails to hang on to her serve in the upcoming game , her tournament could be over rather soon .
strong service from keys sees her establish a short lead , but she then fails on the return as radwanska draws level . keys pulls out an error again , only to respond with a standout forehand winner that sends her opponent the wrong way . radwanska battles back to setup her own break , which is reached when keys comes up short again , this time on her backhand as the ball flies into the net .
sharapova takes her all the way to deuce , but bartoli comes out on top . she 's now two games away from winning this match .
it 's an easy hold for kvitova . it 's one of the few games where the czech has been able to use her serve as a weapon . robson will now serve for the set again .
this time keys sees the radwanska drop shot coming , and gets across to find the pass across the court . she finishes the match with her second ace down the t .
the russian keeps her nerve - for once ! she holds to 30 and this energy-sapping contest continues . remember , there are no tie-breaks at the australian open , so this one could last a while yet !
a well-directed serve out wide sets up the easy conversion for 30-0 before another cross-court backhand creates three game points . halep then fires a backhand out and that makes it 15 points in a row for the italian . that 's ridiculous for a grand slam semi .
the one-two behind her serve seems to be working well for serena when she reaches 30-0 but back comes safarova , who middles a return on the way to 30-30. what a response from williams though , who finds a big first serve before registering an ace out wide . she looks fired up for this .
what a thrilling finish to the match we could have on the card . this time it 's sharapova 's turn to dominate from serve as she takes a 40-0 lead . she 's seels the game with a wonderful shot down the baseline which jankovic can only guide off the court .
break and set ! all the focus is now on erakovic . will she hold her nerve ? two huge serves earn her the first two points , but robson hits successive returns back at her opponent for 30-30. huge point coming up . erakovic double faults ! set point for robson . another double fault ! unbelievable ! what a turnaround ...
once again radwanska weathers the storm and holds to keep her two-game advantage .
well , if all the games are as long as that one we 'll be here until the weekend . li saves two break points in that one and finally holds a 12-minute game with a couple of volleys .
li finds her strongest service game of the match so far , with some brilliantly-timed serves , backed up with some strong ground strokes . li finished with another stunning shot down the sideline , and is just one game away from the set , with azarenka yet to hold serve .
it 's more of the same from keys , who eases into a 40-0 lead with more venomous hitting . a forehand winner and huge first serve seals a love hold . you feel as though venus needs to hold in the next game or this match could run away from her .
kirilenko breaks ! the russian reminds us that this is not over yet , as well as just why she is ranked 10th in the world , as she breaks to deuce to reduce her second-set arrears to a single break of serve .
four games in a row now for makarova , what a dramatic turnaround from the russian after another composed game at the baseline . kvitova is just trying a little too hard to force those ferocious shots at the baseline and needs to regain touch by building points more slowly .
when you have just been dominated for the last 20 minutes of a set , what is the best way to respond ? by breaking your opponent 's serve at the start of a set . it looks as though vinci will do just that when a cross-court return winner brings up three break points , but the response from williams is unreal . a cross-court backhand winner saves the third of three break points before an ace , her fifth , registering 122mph helps complete the game . she looks supreme .
ivanovic holds without too much drama . for once in this match , both women seem to want to win their own serve .
azarenka brings up another set point with a controlled serve that williams hits wide , and this time , she takes it ! the american goes long and we are into a decider .
errani holds ! williams slices a pair of backhands into the net and the italian holds to deuce .
sharapova 's power comes to fore in the first point of the game as she works bouchard over to her backhand to force the miscue . the russian finds her forehand again with a drive down the line that the canadian ca n't return , but then makes another error by smashing her backhand into the net . however , two more excellent shots by the russian secure the game as bouchard has no answer for her play on serve at the moment .
sharapova 's serve has really been on point in this match and she continues to trouble bouchard as she fires her serve down the 't ' to win the first point . the 20-year-old hits back with a powerful return on sharapova 's second serve , but an error from the canadian and another top serve from the number two seed hand her control of the game . bouchard gets the game back to deuce , but sharapova is able to up the ante on her serve to claim the two points needed to win the game .
williams concedes the first point after placing a volley into the top of the net before vinci steps into court to put away a smash . another mistake from williams gifts vinci three game points and the american remains alive with a forehand winner . it 's the italian 's game though , after a net cord sends a shot from williams into the tramlines .
after working so hard to force deuce robson is unable to take advantage , sending successive forehands well wide at the baseline . kanepi is playing effective , defensive tennis and just forcing enough mistakes from her opponent to stay in charge of the match .
that 's a long overdue comfortable hold from stephens , i think the first of the match . she won it to 30 , but azarenka was never really in that game . the belarusian is visibly struggling here with injury . it ca n't happen again , surely ?
and just like that kanepi has a break back , with robson 's early joy on serve quickly forgotten after a lapse of concentration . this looks a very even encounter now .
keys steps into the court to put away a winner for her first point of the match , and that lead is extended when watson goes long . the brit hits back with a deep return off a second serve , but keys is displaying some huge power behind her first , reaching as high as 120mph . she has two game points , but watson replies with a superb cross-court forehand . keys ends the game with an ace to hold serve .
ivanovic keeps her fading hopes alive with an impressive hold , if only she had shown this attacking intent from the outset .
back to square one once more . jankovic was trying to put sharapova on her forehand for some odd reason and paid the price . sharapova takes the game with a wonderful winner down the line . 3-3
vinci retrieves the mini-break when pennetta goes wide , but she immediately gives it back with a forehand into the net . that looked the wrong shot . pennetta is not far away with a backhand down the line that would have given her three set points , but she has two to her name after a mistake from vinci . the first is taken with a serve out wide that is returned into the net and pennetta takes the opener .
williams opens the game with an ace , before kuznetsova sends back a long return . kuznetsova attacks the americans second serve , and forces a couple of errors from the world number one to give her yet another break point , and a double fault hands kuznetsova the game . the russian will now serve for the set .
oh , the irony ! serena hits a double fault and azarenka has an early break . do n't think anyone saw that coming .
lovely tennis on show as muguruza sends a forehand into the corner before taking the point with a simple volley . the williams camp do n't look pleased when a double fault is followed by muguruza firing a backhand winner past the world number one . it 's three break points to the spaniard . ace ! that 's one gone , but muguruza does n't need all three . a superb forehand down the line hands her the breakthrough .
to some extent , keys has nothing to lose now and she comes out with that mentality and breaks to love ! understandably , she 's going for everything , and on that occasion , it paid off .
really good hold in the end for sharapova , but once more she had to battle for it . a serve goes right into the corner and she follows it up with a backhand winner down the line to move three games away from the second round .
williams get onto the front foot for once in a longer rally , and muguruza ca n't return a powerful stroke down the line . the spaniard just needs to keep being aggressive . it 's clearly her best chance of winning this match . stunning return winners help , too , as muguruza delights the crowd to get on the board in the second set . williams has surely never been out-powered like this . it 's a good hold for williams though thanks to an ace . can muguruza continue to handle the pressure on serve ?
after the opening two points are shared , serena crunches a couple of returns back at her opponent and she has two opportunities to break back . she then lands a third , this time on the stretch , and she is understandably pumped .
makarova begins with a well worked point as he moves halep around the court before smashing a winner . a misguided forehand shows the pressure of the situation for the russian , but she responds with a strong serve down the 't ' . the 26-year-old earns two set points with a well executed backhand into the corner . halep continues to show fight , but the set is makarova 's as romanian finds the net once more .

very good from robson . she 's pushed all the way , but holds out . a break here would be very nice .
lisicki 's back in the mood ! she opens with three unreturnable first serves before completing a love-hold with a crosscourt forehand that aggie can only dump into the net .
but azarenka has the break this time ! she gets the advantage before williams goes well long with a forehand . are we heading for a third set !
halep takes the opening point , but she ca n't take advantage , blasting a makable forehand into the net when having the opportunity to reach 15-30. she misses more chances but an error from pennetta gives her a look at break point . the ball sits up for her in the middle of the court but a backhand is hooked wide . big chance missed . the italian pulls through the game but halep looks to have a read of her serve .
it was tough going for radwanska , but a hold is a hold . nothing looks to be giving in the longest rally of the match , until the pole puts a touch more power on a forehand that forces her opponent to net . this set has gone the opposite way of the first .
wow . jankovic won 13 straight points before ivanovic pulled out a ferocious backhand winner at 40-0. she pulled it back to deuce and went on to break her compatriot from the unlikeliest of positions . third chance to serve for the set now ...
it took her to be 5-2 down to finally attack the russian 's serve , but kerber has got one of the breaks back . can she hold ?
good tennis from makarova as she forces the mistake from sharapova to claim the first point of the game . she follows that up with an excellent serve and a winner with a forehand to the opposite side of the court , while sharapova hands her three game points with a strike into the net . the 27-year-old does n't make it easy for her compatriot as she smashes a forehand winner into the corner and forces a miscue with a strike down the line , but an attempted winner from sharapova is wide which give makarova her first game in the second set .
powerful start from williams as she forces wozniacki to hit the net in the first point of the second set , but the american then hits a routine forehand long of the baseline for 15-15. williams comes to the net in the next point for 15-30 , before moving 15-40 ahead with help from the net . the break arrives when wozniacki nets once more .

a shocker of a forehand from muguruza gives radwanska 0-30 , but three points in a row , the third a superb outswinging serve that catches the line , brings up game point for the spaniard , who completes the hold with a backhand conversion that hits the line .
azarenka holds , but hampton is hardly moving now .
the cross-court weapon of pennetta is proving to be a destructive weapon and on most occasions , halep has no answer . a love hold and all of a sudden , the onus is back on halep .
this time keys breaks late in the set ! it was poor from radwanska , who netted at 15-40 down , but a really good response from the american . last time radwanska broke right back and she 'll have to again now or we 're going to a decider .
cirstea forces her way into a couple of rallies and manages to smash a couple of winner past the world number one with some impressively quick footwork around the court . eventually , a long ball from williams gives her her first game of the match .
first set sharapova ! after failing to covert a single set point in the last game , sharapova races into a 40-0 lead , earning three more . an unforced forehand error sees another come and go , but the russian holds to 15 and clinches the opening set by winning the following point thanks to knapp 's horrible forehand into the net .
raswanska does all that she can do by holding serve relatively routinely . the ball is now in li 's court to win this . quite literally .
bouchard starts with an ace for 15-0 , before placing a forehand past kvitova to move 30-0 ahead . kvitova moves onto the board in the next point after bouchard fails to return a powerful forehand , before a whipped forehand levels it at 30-30. another wonderful forehand moves kvitova onto 30-40 , but deuce arrives after the czech clips a backhand just wide . eventually kvitova secures the first break of the match with another sensational forehand .
the first love service game from kanepi , who starts to get that powerful first serve working with variety and width . robson went for an ambitious backhand winner down the line in a gusty move , but saw her effort at 30-0 drift just beyond the sideline .

a loose backhand from keys gets serena off to a positive start in the game , and the 19-year-old does it again with a miscued stroke . williams then double faults , but restores order with a charge to the net that forces a slice from her compatriot and she secures her first game with a powerful serve down the middle .
we 're going to a third set here ! after superb defensive tennis from stephens williams goes long to set up break point , and the youngster grabs it at the first time of asking - well , serena throws it away with a forehand into the net . stephens could well win this .
zakopalova 's turn to be solid with the ball , despite li getting the first point with a fine winner . i really ca n't predict the way this is going .
that might be it now ! two double faults in the game and mattek-sands has thrown that one away . the russian breaks at the perfect time and now just needs to hold for a place in the second round . that 's been easier said than done for her so far , of course .
pennetta records her first point of the contest with a baseline winner before vinci slices into the net to hand her opponent a 30-0 lead . it 's pennetta 's game though after another vinci slice fails to hit the target and the 26th seed is on the board .
perfect start from kvitova as she whips an ace past bouchard for 15-0 , before producing a brilliant forehand to move onto 30-0. bouchard gets on the board in the next point , however , when her opponent fires long . bouchard then hits the net as kvitova moves 40-15 ahead and the czech holds when the canadian fires long once more .
this is the williams you expect to see . she dictates the tempo of rallies much better in the game , and a couple of ground strokes are too much for muguruza . the excellent defence is on show too as she chases down what appears to be a lost cause to force muguruza into a difficult volley , which drifts long . a hold to love should give her confidence .
nerves finally get the better of robson as she tries to save a second set point , spraying a wayward forehand wide of the line . kanepi showed a touch more composure there as both players tightened up , using a fierce first serve to win the crucial points when it mattered . the 19-year-old has it all to do now , but has produced a spirited fightback already in her run to the fourth round .
she 's in danger of losing this set to love . watson looks deflated out there and i give this one 15 more minutes .
equally as impressive from robson . big couple of games coming up now as the set nears a conclusion .
sharapova thinks she has the chance to go on the attack when williams misses her first serve , but a big second serve sees the russian return the ball to the net . an ace from williams gives her a 40-15 lead , and she tries to seal the game with a drop shot , but some impressive pace from sharapova ensures that she makes the return . a long forehand on the next point from the defending champion sees williams hold .
an early challenge from cetkovska as she challenges an overrule from the line judge , but the intervention was correct and helps wozniacki complete an early hold of serve .
she keeps her bottle and pironkova takes the first set . she 's deserved that , too , as her serve was far more impressive throughout .
a hold to 15 to begin the set for lisicki . that 's her first game since the opening game of the match and just what the doctor ordered .
perfect from halep . she returns with an ace to hold her serve .
that 's much better from williams ! the world number one is immediately looking to attack lim 's serve and gives herself two break points with some solid play at the net . a poor serve form lim allows williams to pounce at the net again and get a break early in this set .
i knew this would happen . as soon as i start praising doi , she produces a stinker of a game . she throws in a double fault at 0-30 to give kvitova three break points , and the czech player takes the first of them when doi nets .
the defending champion tightens her grip on this match and is squeezing tighter and tighter . nice point from vesnina to get to 40-30 , skimming a ball over the net before following in with a volley . but it counts for little now .
an encouraging long rally from wozniacki fails to earn the dane a reprieve , with cetkovska brutally sending a deft chip over the net to edge further ahead . the ninth seed will now have to serve to keep this first set alive .
the run of breaks is ended as radwanska holds to love , with lisicki seemingly giving up on this set . can she regain her composure here ?
just as the american has sharapova running , she blows the chance with a forehand into the tramlines . she then gets advantage back with an ace and follows it up with another good serve that 's returned into the net . important hold .
just as i say that serena is getting back into it she 's goes and has another nightmare of a game . azarenka holds and it 's 3-3 .
i will say it again - cibulkova is working so hard at the back of the court - but most of the time , it 's not paying off as serena imposes herself on each point . a forehand winner takes serena to 30-30 , but a couple of mistakes means that the american 's advantage remains at just the one break .
the american wins the first point of the game with a forehand return , but the pole hits back quickly with her serve to take a 30-15 lead . keys plays the point of the match as she volleys at the net before being lobbed by the pole , but she recovers to smash a forehand past her opponent . however , her efforts are in vain as the 26-year-old ups the ante to earn the final two points with powerful play .
break and set ! bouchard makes an early mistake as her forehand travels out , but she makes up for it in the next rally as the duo exchange a ferocious barrage of shots before the 20-year-old comes up with a forehand winner deep into the corner . however , the number two seed comes up with an impressive backhand to bring the error from the canadian . after restoring parity bouchard is unable to hold the russian back as he commits back-to-back miscues on her backhand as sharapova takes the first set .
break , game and set ! wow , what an opening set . sharapova falls straight to a 30-0 deficit with both shots creeping just out . a touch less power on her efforts , and she may even be winning this contest . she comes back though with a nice stride towards the net after an obvious drop shot from jankovic but then hammers a shot into the net to give jankovic two set points . the leader is pegged back as she fails to deal with the spin on the champion 's shot but takes the set as sharapova puts another strike the wrong side of the line .
pressure from muguruza now as she takes the opening point and asks the question of bacsinszky 's forehand . the swiss player responds when the spaniard fires wide and fails on a challenge . muguruza moves forward on the attack and strikes with a tasty forehand that rockets down the line to give her the edge . break point is established when bacsinszky chips into the net , before the swiss delivers a wonderful chip . muguruza eventually takes the break when she comes up with a stunner of backhand to hammer the ball down into the corner .
a stroll for radwanska in that game to earn a break without having to get aggressive or force the play . ivanovic is too erratic and unless she can stamp out these unforced errors her tournament will be over .
bruising consistency from the belarusian and kuznetsova has no answer whatsoever to her first service game . that one too just the minute .
break back ! kvitova quickly puts the mistakes of the first game behind her , playing to pennetta 's forehand to force a mistake from the italian , before coming into the net to punch a forehand of her won to the back corner to bring up two break points of her own . pennetta misses her first serve , giving the czech a chance to come in again , which she does , swiftly leveling the set .
sharapova goes two breaks up and will serve for the match , after the closest game of the match so far . williams has brought up just one break point against the russian 's serve so far .
a lucky net cord gets venus off to the perfect start before two big serves are struck out by keys . however , the seven-time major winner makes two mistakes to allow keys a way back into the game before the younger of the two american hitters hooks a return wide .
you would have expected the momentum to have shifted , but azarenka creates an opportunity for her rival with a double fault . halep finds the net with a slightly miscued forehand before the romanian is handed two break points by an unforced error from azarenka , who hits back to save one with some great length on her strokes before a brilliant forehand winner clinches the point . an excellent second serve down the middle allows her to retain the control and halep is unable to find the line with the forehand on the run . stunning ! point of the match as both players produce some fantastic shots from the baseline . the running is eventually too much for halep , who is unable to get closer to azarenka 's superb forehand . a lack of patience prevents her from seeing out the game when she delivers a wayward forehand and an easy pass from halep after chasing down yet another poor drop shot brings up a second break point . azarenka bounces back with another winner , this time on the backhand side . a venture to the net ends with an emphatic volley from the belarusian , but halep refuses to give up ! she gets behind a powerful stroke to beat the advancing azarenka with a perfect backhand winner . advantage is secured and lost once again from azarenka , before a forehand winner edges her ahead when a halep review proves she clipped baseline . the hold is finally clinched when halep hits the net with a backhand . azarenka somehow escapes a 10-minute game . it is turning into a memorable match in new york .
the russian is dominating the court at the moment as she pulls the 20-year-old one way then the other before hitting a forehand winner , but bouchard gives her a taste of her own medicine in the next point before finding a bullet serve down the 't ' . a loose shot from sharapova hands the 20-year-old two game points , but she needs only one as sharapova claims the ball is out from a bouchard forehand , but replays show it bounces on the line .
another short game but this time its ivanovic who finds some form , mixing things up with a neat volley at the net to bring up a comfortable hold . a crucial confidence boost for the volatile serb .
a hold ! a hold of serve ! it 's azarenka who opens up daylight by holding to 15 in a game that included a delicious drop-shot . looks like we 'll be heading into a deciding third set !
from 0-30 serena claws her way back to 30-30 in that game but azarenka comes through to hold . she 's just one game away from levelling this contest up .
watson needs to capitalise on that game , but she lets off the american with two clumsy shots and she is down 0-30. however , she responds in fine style , driving a cross-court winner before peppering the american from the baseline to force the error . she ca n't continue the momentum , though , and keys breaks back when watson nets twice in succession .
after the length of that last game , that one just breezed by . radwanska was in control - at least at times - but there was a couple of really nice shots from keys too .
azarenka goes just wide wide a deep backhand and hampton makes it three breaks in a row . she 's back ahead in this second set .
kvitova fails to get pennetta 's first three serves back in play as the italian cruises towards a comfortable hold . kvitova does get the ball back while 40-0 down , but the italian easily guides it down the sideline for a backhand winner . that might be the most comfortable hold of serve we 've seen all match !
venus goes long and it 's another break point for the german .
a game strewn with radwanska errors sees the first break go to the italian . errani only had to be accurate there , not excellent , and that will delight her .
a sixth successive break of serve means that this second set is now bordering on the ridiculous . a packed court one is clearly delighted with another superb response from stephens though , as she uses swift movement to find a forehand winner inside the baseline . can she finally get a hold in the next service game that would boost her chances considerably ?
williams is looking so strong as she quickly takes a 40-0 lead . she is briefly rattled by a foot fault call as she gets ready to serve form the game , but quickly finds her composure , firing another big serve at garcia , which the french player ca n't return . garcia must hold next to keep herself in the match .
a comfortable hold for makarova to consolidate her break . an excellent start for her .
the 13th seed stays in touch with another routine hold , which once again featured a fine forehand winner . ivanovic has always been an entertaining player capable of producing winners from the back of the court .
break back ! halep 's shows resolve early on as she quickly gets the set back on serve . azarenka misses a couple of early serves , allowing halep to attack on the return . the second seed creates to break points before she watches a backhand from the 20th seed go long , before another mistake from azarenka hands her the game .
this is turning into a really assured performance from keys . when she takes the initiative , she is generally coming out on top . venus is doing a lot of running and stretching but so far , her efforts are n't getting the reward . an inside-out forehand earns keys two game points before venus hits a second-serve return long .
the first serve in the sixth sets up an intense rally that bacsinszky eventually takes thanks to some help from the net . the point is the start of an unchallenged push from the swiss player who moves unopposed to 40-0. muguruza does get one point in , but then loses out to a clever backhand down the line .
radwanska takes her third game in a row , and with a break here would pull level . it 's all going wrong for pironkova at the moment and really needs to hold now .
the 20-year-old finds her rhythm straightaway with a backhand winner which bounces on the baseline , and then follow that up with a forehand winner into the corner . sharapova 's response is emphatic as she works the canadian around the court before producing a drop shot to win the point . however , the number seven seed shows her spirit to fight back to force two errors from sharapova to take the game .
sharapova opens up with a double fault before dumping a backhand into the net . kirilenko quickly gets to 0-30 but she floats a backhand long on the next point . the number five seed proceeds to close the door on kirilenko 's chance of an early break to hold to 30 .
a series of powerful forehands from the world number one eventually take their toll on the romanian , who struggles with serve and loses it to love after an apology for a drop shot ends with azarenka wrong-footing her for the winner .
this is some match now . vinci starts with a crunching winner but serena responds in kind , and is going absolutely berserk . that only intensifies when she catches the line with the backhand of the match before she lets out a shriek when vinci ca n't return a first serve .
heavy hitting deep down the line gets the early hold for kvitova , who had to recover quickly after a couple of sloppy points on serve .
signs of confidence from the estonian now as she holds to love with minimum fuss . kanepi looked very convincing behind a slice serve in that game , putting robson back on serve in just over a minute .
another poor forehand from watson and radwanska is now just one game away from being the first player into the fourth round .
eight games in a row now for makarova , with kvitova continuing to look tense at the baseline as she drills successive forehands well past the baseline . surely the rot must stop in the next for the eighth seed or it looks increasingly bleak for her chances of victory .
tense times in this second set now . sharapova pulls off a magnificent drop shot to bring her back into the game at 30-15 , before flinging herself at the ball at full stretch to somehow play a backhand across court and level the game . jankovic then went back in front though in a cracking rally , as she curves a forehand outwards to the tramlines before correctly calling a sharapova shot out to pile the nerves on the russian . 5-4 .
break back ! another return winner moves lisicki to 15-40. she misses on the first break point but converts the second with a simple volley at the net .
like in the final game of the first set , kirilenko looks in control of the game but sharapova fights back with a forehand winner from the baseline to gain a break point . it 's a huge moment for kirilenko , but she shows an incredible touch with a backhand drop shot that has sharapova sprawling at the net . that touch soon deserts her though , and after a double fault , she dumps a backhand into the net to give sharapova a clear advantage .
wonderful from azarenka as she makes a rare wander to the net before putting away the volley to hold .
radwanska really has n't had a chance on the keys serve so far and the american breezes through another game to level it .
have to say it 's not great surprise that radwanska has made the breakthrough already . she races into a 0-40 lead and takes the game at the second time of asking .
sharapova breaks ! the second set is less than 15 minutes old , but the third seed already seems in total control . she breaks to 15 , as knapp contributes to her own downfall with two unforced errors and a game-ending double fault .
if you thought that doi would lose encouragement after that first game , think again , because she engineers a break point after kvitova nets , but she floats a forehand return just wide . she creates another chance , but again , she ca n't keep the ball on court . the number seven seed finally edges through the game to consolidate the break .
williams opens with a double fault , but she makes up for it with an authoritative smash . the first ace of the match takes her to 30-15 , before a forehand winner into the corner tells muguruza that she is already tuned in to this match . however , muguruza catches the line for 40-30 before two double faults in a row hand the spaniard a break point ! williams saves a couple of break points , while a third is saved with a big second serve . muguruza gets a fourth opportunity , and this time , she takes it when serena drills a backhand long .
we are only in the fifth game and serena is already shouting `` come on ! '' after every point . to her credit , she puts together a quite ruthless game , unleashing a number of forehands and drive volleys to seal a love hold .
muguruza starts the game well , but williams 's hitting is relentless now and the spaniard is struggling to cope . it 's two break points for serena , and although the first is saved with an ace , the second sees muguruza blaze a forehand long . we are back on serve .
vinci finally gets a bit of luck when her forehand clips the net , dropping on li 's side of the court , but the sixth seed continues to dictate the game form the back of the court , before successfully coming into the net to seal the game .
cirstea makes a superb start to the second set with a powerful backhand to the back of the court , before a mistake from watson gives her a 30-0 lead . a wide forehand from the world number 46 brings up two break points for cirstea , but she needs just one to clinch the game . that 's six in a row for the romanian now .
the ball-striking of pennetta is relentless and after a backhand winner takes her to 0-30 , dominating a rally two points later takes her to two break points . she only requires one though , with halep netting after more pressure from her opponent .
this has been a fast start from williams , whose heavy hitting is seeing her dominate from the baseline . she moves to 30-0 , but azarenka strikes back with a cross-court return that forces williams to net for 30-30. the world number one then makes a further two mistakes , and out of nowhere , azarenka breaks back !
the pole continues to dominate on her serve as she surges into a 40-0 lead . the american struggles once again for the depth on her returns which presents radwasnka with easy points , and although she commits one error , the 26-year-old levels the set with relative ease .
sharapova is yet to lose a game so far in this tournament , and she 's not ready to let williams have one yet . a few difficulties on serve for the american , as she opens with a double fault . a shaky start for the 25th seed .
well that did n't last long ! stosur breaks back at the first time of asking . game on again .
lisicki ca n't respond to being broken as bartoli holds to love to consolidate .
and she backs that up with a hold . bartoli to serve now for a 5-2 lead .
and she takes it ! great response from jankovic to keep herself in the set .
you 'd expect williams to come out all guns blazing at the start of the second but there 's little she can do against the brilliance of lisicki at the moment . the german wraps up a hold to 15 with her third second-serve ace . great stuff .
vinci moves three points away when her aggression forces an error out of williams , but it 's such a gutsy response from the defending champion , who converts a smash after several are defended by her opponent . two big serves move serena to 40-15 , before a second smash winner seals the game . what a game we have coming up . can serena save the calendar grand slam ?
from one extreme to the next as bartoli earns a comfortable hold to ease back ahead late in the second set . all the pressure now falls back under the american youngster , who must serve for a place in the match for a second time !
williams shows some fight as she takes her first game in the second set , having found herself 40-0 down and facing three more break points . sharapova made a couple of mistakes during that game , but has williams left it too late to get back in to this match ?
break : williams is showing absolutely no respect to the errani serve , which is getting battered back at the italian at double the original speed . the break is inevitable and comes to 40 .
williams breaks to 15 with some mammoth mid-court striking . she is just four points away from the final .
bartoli holds serve with a second serve ace down the middle . these early nerves are understandable as both women have a real shot at their first grand slam .
well , well , well ... she broke herself in that one . the double fault count is creeping up . vesnina takes the early break ... or is given it , rather . from 0-40 down , as well .
williams begins the game with her second and third aces but is soon 30-40 behind . she finds a big serve down the middle but somehow lisicki lobs the ball high into the sky and inside the baseline . you 'd expect the world number one to rocket the backhand away but she fluffs her lines and amazingly it 's lisicki who breaks first .
sharapova holds to 15. the match is 21 minutes old .
awesome . that 's the best way to describe that game from stosur . any momentum robson had built up was trampled on there ! the aussie is one game away .
sharapova breaks ! knapp reels off three straight points to level at deuce , but sharapova quickly earns a fourth break point , which she converts with a huge forehand volley . knapp complains to the umpire that the russian screamed `` come on '' before the point was complete . no action is taken though .
finally stosur gets a game on the board . she may still be two breaks behind , but it 's a start at least .
another break of serve and this one brings up the opening set for radwanska . there have been good spells form the brit , but overall radwanska was on top and deserved to take it .
right on cue , azarenka turns the screw and forces the break . her power is telling at the minute and she attacked the kuznetsova serve to break at the ideal time . she now serves for the match .
from 40-0 , kirilenko pushes robson back to 40-30. however , the aussie-born brit then dispatches a stunning forehand down the line to regain her first-set lead .
li once again battle to deuce . it panics sharapova , who puts a forehand well wide before wildly finding the net . four games running for li , who will now serve for the match .
that 's just what sharapova was looking for at the start of the set . a relatively comfortable hold to love gives her something to hang on to .
tie break ! a hold from robson sends this tense first-set to a tie breaker , which starts with a confident move from the brit at the net for an early 1-0 lead .
azarenka starts the game with a couple of big mistakes to open the door to halep , who kicks it open by chasing down a poor drop shot to easily pass her rival with the passing forehand . three break points . azarenka saves one by going cross-court with a powerful forehand , but her serve is broken when halep moves the 20th seed out wide before beating her down the line with a backhand winner . key moment in the match .
muguruza begins with two welcome points behind her first serve , because she 's given a third successive free point when serena goes long with a return . a love hold is complete when another return is miscued . she 'll be delighted with that .
she finally converts a break point and we 're back on serve in this one . azarenka has turned it up over the last couple of games and is looking the more comfortable out there .
and that could be curtains for jankovic . she hands radwanska two break points and the world number two does not pass up the opportunity .
wozniacki moves 15-0 ahead when williams fires a forehand wide , but the american responds in the next point with a passing shot . williams then hits one down the line to move onto 15-30 , before wozniacki nets to hand williams 15-40. williams hits wozniacki 's next serve long for 30-40 , but breaks when wozniacki nets .
and that , could be that ! awesome attack from sharapova against bartoli , who gave everything she had . it was n't enough though and sharapova is now serving for the match .
stunning game from sharapova . i 'd go as far as saying it was her best of the match . she had bartoli scampering all over the court .
kvitova has already made 18 errors , and she throws in two more to hand doi 0-30. she remains composed to get to 30-30 , but doi benefits from a net-cord for the second time in the match to earn break point . kvitova saves the first , and she is forced to do so twice more to avoid falling 5-1 behind before finally sealing the game .
a pretty comfortable serve for the pole . we 're still yet to see a break and indeed it was radwanska on her previous serve that looked most likely to be broken .
there 's nothing the pole can do against serves like that , though . it 's another ace to end the set and it 's gone to a decider . who will come out on top ? it could be a big upset here .
it 's a great start for sharapova as azarenka double faults to hand the russian the break .
make that 11 successive point won on serve , with bartoli quickly building a 40-0 lead behind a wide backhand winner . an unforced error from the frenchwoman proves to be just a momentary blip , with a strong first serve helping keep this first set firmly on serve in the early going .
much of serena 's performance has been about her hitting from the back of the court , but she ends two points in a row with a well-timed volley . cibulkova gets back to 30-30 but another return winner brings up the chance of a double break . a lucky net cord results in the slovakian saving it , but when serena creates a second , she strikes to move a game away from the last four .
big , big hold ! she had to fend off another couple of break points , but in the end it was two unforced errors from li to hand the game to her opponent . it was beginning to look as though li was gaining confidence , but suddenly the errors came back and there have been far too many so far from both women .

bacsinszky gets a little lucky to open the scores when her shot hits the net and falls just short of an on-rushing muguruza . parity is drawn when bacsinszky fails on the forehand , but her spanish opponent also comes up short with a forehand that flies beyond the baseline . the mistake does n't get to muguruza too much and she comes back with a powerful forehand winner . bacsinszky eventually holds strong , though , and closes the game out with an ace .
what is going on here ? an eighth double fault from williams is followed by a backhand passing shot from muguruza . this is getting interesting . the plot thickens when muguruza unleashes a magnificent backhand return winner for three break points , before williams registers a 10th ace . a big first serve reduces the score 30-40 , before another ace saves the third break point . this is brilliant . it gets better - an ace registering 121mph takes serena to championship point before muguruza delivers the most impressive of replies as a forehand is drilled into the corner . the spaniard then hits one of the biggest returns you 'll ever see to reach a fourth break point but she goes agonisingly long with a backhand . an epic rally ends with serena netting a forehand for a fifth break point for muguruza , and this time , she takes it with a crunching forehand winner . this is incredible !
sharapova is playing beautifully . she holds to 30 to level the second set at one game all . the fans seem to be on the side of the russian , however the ease with which she is getting the job done has left them somewhat subdued .
i 'll tell you something , serena is far from done in this match . at 30-0 , she makes plenty of ground to stretch to make a drop shot before catching the baseline to record the winner . it 's a remarkable shot . she then crushes a baseline winner for the love hold and bacsinszky has something to think about .
a slightly nervous-looking robson allows kvitova a 40-0 lead , before fighting back to 40-30 , but the lead for too great for the czech , and she sent robson out wide , forcing the brit to send the ball in to the net from a tricky angle .
we 've seen the tide change numerous times in this match but is this the moment that keys makes her move ? more unbelievably strong hitting , given the condition of her thigh , from the younger of the two americans sees her hold to 15 and when we return , venus will be serving to remain in the tournament .
the belarusian starts with a comfortable service game , ending it with a big ace . perfect start .
pennetta consolidates the break with ease as a drained kvitova makes mistake after mistake , firing a backhand long before a forehand goes wide . on paper , it should be pennetta who is struggling with the longer match , having played two more sets than kvitova to get this far , while also competing in the women 's doubles with compatriot sara errani , but it 's the czech who is flagging .
the intensity from serena has lowered in the last few minutes while cibulkova looks determined to make something happen . the 11th seed hits a forehand winner for 15-30 before connecting with an audacious volley at the net for two break points . huge response from serena , though , who rattles off four consecutive points - two aces , a unreturned first serve and a backhand winner - to re-open her two-game margin .
at 30-0 down , muguruza misses the easiest of forehands - those kind of errors were n't coming 45 minutes ago . radwanska holds to love with a nice drop shot at the net .

radwanska moves to within two games of the match by holding to 30. li is running out of chances to take this into a decider .
through gritted teeth wozniacki keeps the second set on serve , doing just enough with precise ground strokes at the baseline . a quick change of ends sees the dane apply yet more strapping to her left ankle , a sure sign that she is seeking further support .
there 's an air of invincibility about williams now . azarenka is n't doing a lot wrong , but two aces help take williams to 40-0. the american throws up a 65mph second serve , but after she connects with the return , it 's point over .
oh yes . a thunderous forehand volley makes it 0-40 before azarenka double faults to give the russian another break . this is very one sided right now . sharapova serving for the set .

one break back ! an extended rally ends with bartoli hitting long and that 's one break back for lisicki . she could n't do it , could she ?

a straight-forward game for sharapova . williams has no answer for her serve . usually her forehand is excellent , but sharapova is forcing her into mistakes while using it .

the dane shows tremendous spirit to save two break points , mixing things up to switch play at the baseline . her joy is shortlived though , with the ninth seed sending two forehand 's long in quick succession to hand her opponent the vital break . it looks like the former world number one is helpless to prevent another early wimbledon exit at this stage .
half an hour ago it looked like the number one seed would be on her way home but now she looks sure to reach the quarter-finals as expected .

the russian finishes with an ace to draw level . confident start by both players .
make that a second hold to love for robson , who is definitely finding her groove with a pair of awesome forehand winners into the corner . kanepi has failed to put any pressure on the brit 's serve so far , preferring to stay deep at the baseline and wait for errors .
what a forehand winner from li ! the czech has bottled it , it must be said , but still that 's a fine shot to send us back on serve . no tie-break , remember .

there finally is the break , and it 's following another atrocious line call . this time keys 's forehand was called in , but it was some way out - with it the pole takes the set without the need for a breaker .
no problems at all for the italian , who took control of that set from about the midway point and deservedly claims the first . this will be a big test of radwanska 's character .

serena is going through the motions on her serve and she records another ace on the way to three set points . safarova saves the first by forcing williams to net with a backhand on the stretch but she takes the second with a big serve out wide . there 's been no signs of the illness that plagued her against bacsinszky and that spells trouble for safarova .
what 's that , an easy service hold ? this match just keeps on surprising . li fights back late in the game with a big forehand down the line , then zakopalova nets , but when li goes long we go back to parity . we 're at the business end now .
more encouragement for watson , who wins the opening point , but again , the power and accuracy that keys is finding with her serve is terrifying for someone who is 18 , and she eases through the game with a couple of quick points . watson will return to serve to remain in the match for the second time .
more brutal hitting from williams takes her to 15-30 but safarova responds with an outswinging serve to force the mistake from the american . it 's not enough to discourage williams though , who hits through the ball two more times on a return to leave safarova with no answer . this is brutally good .
watson recovers well to take the opening game of the match from behind . she did n't panic early on and it 's a good start .

in contrast to murray 's dip during service games , federer is serving better now than at any point during the previous three sets . however , a poor drop shot from the second seed , followed by a stunning backhand from the scot brings up break point . he dictates the rally , sending federer the full width of the baseline , and it 's too much for the swiss . murray is right back in this set .

the backhand falters for novak a little back on cilic 's serve , but his opponent then fails with one of the worst chips i have ever seen in the history of tennis . cilic moves back in front when djokovic is forced into an error of his own , but they do not call him the world number one for no reason ! he comes straight on the attack with a wonderful forehand winner to tie the scores . more mistakes from cilic arise ... what 's that ? another break ? okay then ... novak completes the game when cilic double faults for the second time .
very little resistance from almagro on the ferrer serve . he holds to love and is quickly level . it 's a matter of time for the ferrer break , i think .

stan finally levels up the set at two games apiece , but he 's been made to work so , so , so hard to win his own serve here . gasquet is threatening a major scalp and , again , it 's only a matter of time before he breaks the wawrinka serve . at the moment he 's showing more heart .
this is beginning to look ominous for rosol . nadal is really imposing himself in every exchange , and the czech is n't getting much of a look in . he holds to love .
wowzers . i feel sorry for the ball in that rally . the pair trade huge blows before wawrinka directs a beautiful backhand down the line for a 30-15 lead . however , falla 's unfazed , and a forehand winner brings up 30-30 , but wawrinka produces two serves that ca n't be returned to level the set at three apiece .
there are some obvious nerves from the belgian as he misses two of his opening three first serves , allowing murray to come in from the baseline an attack , forcing a couple of errors from the world number 105. goffin mistimes a cross-court forehand as he sends the ball into the net to give murray a chance to break , but his forehand goes just wide as he tries to wrap up the game . however , goffin 's nerves continue as he fires long on back-to-back points to give murray the break .

he takes it straight away as janowicz attempts a drop shot but ca n't get it over the net . superb start from the man who started as underdog , remember .
we have to remember that monfils is actually a very good player . he 's just being made to look ordinary by a superhuman nadal today . however , he just about gets the better in that game , with help from a 134mph second-serve ace ! amazing .
i do n't think there is any question now that nadal is struggling physically to chase down these darcis cannons across court , with the belgian taking advantage to earn a hard-fought hold . if the spaniard harbours any realistic hopes of a comeback he surely must hold in the next service game .
murray takes the first point after a backhand slice makes berdych slip and he 's down again on the next ! murray has 0-30 , but berdych successfully challenges an out-call to register an ace , and a net cord helps berdych get back to 30-30. however , it 's break point to murray after a well-directed backhand makes berdych volley into the net , and it 's taken when berdych ca n't handle a cross-court backhand .

federer 's backhand has been a thing of beauty this evening and another passing shot off that wing takes him to 15-30. it is n't enough to discourage matosevic though , and he powers back to hold serve .

federer goes millimetres wide with a passing backhand but it 's a comfortable opener in the second set for the frenchman .
all too easy there for djokovic , who mixed things up with aggression at the net to claim a two-set advantage . that will probably prove enough to see the serb progress , but he will want to maintain focus and end this match with minimum effort .
whatever tsonga can do , cilic can perhaps do better : the croatian returns with an untouchable game of his own , which is concluded with an ace .
another quick service game and break points are becoming few and far between here .
first point to murray , who connects with a second-serve return , but a perfect ace down the middle earns parity from dimitrov . he mixes it up with a serve out wide that murray ca n't return , and a comfortable volley at the net sees him bring up two game points . super game from the 23-year-old , who takes us into a tie-break with an ace out wide .

fourth set djokovic : the serb takes the breaker 7-3 and this match is going the distance .
ferrer relentlessly pushes towards the semi-finals , playing some spectacular shots to take a 30-0 lead , but he tries a bit too hard in the third point of the game , just pushing his forehand wide . a backhand drop shot puts him back in control , before a huge mis-hit from robredo hands him the game . ferrer needs just one more game to wrap up the match .
it 's another tough hold from djokovic , but there was no real threat of a break in truth . the serb is being largely matched at the baseline and this time it 's his turn to pull off a sublime drop shot that his opponent does not even reach . djokovic will surely be ramping up the pressure during goffin 's next serve .
excellent stuff from ferrer , who wraps up a service game to love that will surely give him a bit of a confidence boost . his ego has certainly taken a hit after that first set .
dimitrov sends a routine forehand wide of the mark to concede the first point , but he is soon back level with an ace . the 23-year-old steps into court to put away a forehand for a 30-15 lead , but a huge double fault gives murray an opening at 30-30. he survives , though , and we remain on serve .

brute force on first serve sees berdych win three successive points , with a rare double fault quickly inviting tomic back into a service game that looked fairly routine . the seventh seed responds quickly though , slamming a second serve down the line to keep the fourth set on serve in the early going .
now almagro must serve to save the net . quite a turnaround these last few minutes and we 've started to see the best of ferrer . there 's just a sense here ... can he take it all the way ? you bet he can , but there 's a mountain to climb first , starting with a break here or a tie break win .
too little , too late in the game from djokovic and istomin holds for a solid start to his match . how can djokovic respond with his first service game ?
the serve favours murray on this occasion with a service winner putting the sixth seed ahead at 30-15. a dramatic exchange at the net eventually sees murray grab a further lead with a wonderful chip , that forces kyrgios to thrash the ball into the crowd where somebody takes a belter of a catch . murray grabs the game by forcing a forehand issue for kyrgios .

nadal sends a backhand into the net , and he comes so , so close to falling 0-30 behind , but a djokovic backhand just misses the line . however , nadal throws in a double fault and this is tentative from the left-hander . a perfectly-executed defensive lob has nadal on the back foot and a smash into the net gives two break points to djokovic . he misses out on the first , but he pushes nadal wide on the second to force the mistake and we are back on serve in the fourth !
nieminen shows incredible pace around the court as he rushes in to the net for a volley , only to see it returns to the baseline by djokovic . to the crowd 's amazement , the finn sprints back in time to hit an excellent forehand down the sideline to claim the point . an uncharacteristic sloppy backhand from djokovic allows the world number 87 to wrap the game up on the next point with another stunning forehand winner . the finn may have made a slow start , dropping his serve in the opening game of the set , but he 's recovered well . whether or not he can get the break back though is another matter .
ferrer seems to be able to do no wrong , as he clips the sideline with a brilliant forehand , forcing dolgopolov to smash the ball into the net , bringing up three more break points for the fourth seed . a couple of big serves from the 26th seed pull it back to 40-30 before a wide forehand brings up deuce . dolgopolov forces advantage for the third time , before firing a 127mph serve at his opponent , who fails to make the return . dolgopolov did well to get himself through that game , after such a strong start by the spaniard .

gasquet gets to 30-03 as he looks for the double break , but a long return gives game point to robredo , which is converted with an easy volley at the net .
nishikori takes the first point , but nadal soon has him on the back foot once more . the number 13 seed shows a bit more determination in moving to the brink of the game , but he goes long and nadal has deuce . nishikori hangs in there though , and moves in to hit a cross-court winner for the game .
another easy hold for murray . now it 's clear to see simon is drained of energy . it was bound to happen .

good hold for the german as he smashes a djokovic lob past the serb . at least he 's competing much better in this set .
at 30-15 fognini plops up a smash for nadal and just walks back to the service line , knowing he had no hope of winning the point . nadal holds emphatically with some big hitting , but still needs to earn back that break .
the writing looks on the wall when gasquet frames a forehand to concede 15-30 , but a trademark backhand shot helps him get back on level terms . however , he misses with it during the next rally , handing match point to djokovic , but he sends a backhand long after dominating the point . he gets a second chance after a backhand volley , but again , it 's saved by gasquet thanks to a well-struck forehand into the corner . gasquet wastes a game point of his own , but he eventually holds when djokovic nets a return .
it will be interesting to see how wawrinka responds from that . he looked the stronger of the two players at the back end of the set but out of nowhere , his game let him down . djokovic holds relatively comfortably to 15 and wawrinka needs a hold in the next game .
nadal starts his service game with three meaty serves that rosol ca n't return and the spaniard has 40-0. rosol manages to get into a rally on the fourth point but he nets and rafa begins with a love game .
djokovic shows incredible relfexes at the net to 15-0 before federer miscues a forehand when on the attack . that was a chance . however , the world number one twice finds the net and we have 30-30 - federer is two points from the set . it should be one but federer sends a smash right onto the racquet of djokovic who fires straight back at the swiss . djokovic is pumped ! the serbian misses out but he gets a second chance with a superb forehand that catches the line . federer is n't finished though , and a missed forehand from djokovic gives federer a set point . djokovic comes back to create a game point but federer gets a second chance for the set with a backhand down the line . he misses an absolute sitter of a forehand though , and is made to pay the price . after a 14-minute game , djokovic holds . how huge could that be ?
it appeared to be plain sailing for cilic but a couple of nervy backhands into the net give nishikori a chance to get one of the breaks back . like on the previous occasion though , the advantage quickly evaporates as cilic winds up with his first serve and forehand , but nishikori gets a third chance to break when cilic incorrectly challenges a call and he strikes when cilic blasts a forehand long .

what a killer blow ! murray serves to the spaniard 's backhand and his return slaps against the tape outside of the sideline but spins into the court and murray can do absolutely nothing about that .
federer could do with a fast start in this set . after taking the first point , he drills a blistering forehand at nadal for 30-30. but what a mistake on the next ! federer sets up the point beautifully before dumping a drive volley into the net . the point was there for the taking ! nadal then plays the most ridiculous of backhands from the baseline to take the game .

it 's a change of shirt for murray , but can it bring a change in fortune ? maybe . federer frames a forehand to make it 15-15 , but maybe not . two super serves bring two easy put-aways , and more aggressive play forces murray to go long . federer has conceded one break point in his last five-and-a-half sets .
a powerful forehand down the line in response to wawrinka 's second serve puts nadal 0-30 up and then a net call goes in his favour to bring up three break points . huge credit to wawrinka , though , as he claws back all three , despite struggling to land his first service in . he then wins the next two points , the last of which was an ace , to open up a one-set advantage in melbourne . he 's broken his duck against nadal - can he win three sets ? !

resilient response by nadal , who holds to 40. djokovic is the much more aggressive player right now , but will he be able to maintain it ? he will have to , because , as we know , nadal is frighteningly consistent .
the games are getting slightly longer , meaning that it can only be bad for both players in terms of fitness . but stan the man levels up the deciding set at one game apiece with an ace to clinch the last point . he 's got a ridiculous amount of aces today . it 's not exactly karlovic levels , but it must be close .
almagro lets out another deafening `` vamos ! '' as petzschner hits long to hand him the break . the spaniard needs to hold serve to bring himself back level at 5-5 and certainly seems fired up to do so . meanwhile , petzschner seemed to crack when he needed a steady head . oh tennis , how you throw up such moments .

the set remains on serve with another easy hold from federer . neither player is yet to take charge of this set . it 's still pretty early in the set , but i would n't be surprised if we 're heading to a tie break .

murray matches verdasco in holding to love and the tip-toe nature of this deciding fifth set continues .
the first love game is followed up by the second as fognini recovers well . he played some good shots there and returned to the form from the first set - can he keep it up though and win the break back ?
robredo could be accused of having an over-reliance on stepping around the ball to use his forehand , but he uses the technique to great effect to earn a break point . however , a wawrinka forehand catches the line and after a couple of robredo mistakes , the number eight seed moves one away from the opening set .

some efficient play from falla quickly takes him to 40-0 , but wawrinka remains in the game by flicking the ball past his opponent at the net . two fierce forehands from wawrinka take him to deuce , and out of nowhere , wawrinka has a break point after falla nets . that 's so disappointing from the colombian , who sends a wild backhand long , and we are back on serve in the third .
two successive double faults set up a federer break point but paire does well to force the swiss wide to save it . he then does well to recover and take the game .

what a cross-court forehand from the big-serving isner ! five each .
there have n't been a whole lot of winners lately , but the play becomes a bit more positive when federer uses his skills at the net to move to 30-0. the next two points are shared , before a third ace from federer guarantees him at least a tie-break .
this set deserves a tie-break , and two points from falla get us halfway there . wawrinka then misses out with a passing shot to allow falla to move to 40-15 , and we move into a breaker after the swiss misses the baseline .
routine stuff from djokovic , who holds . one point was a quite spectacular backhand when he was forced back way behind the baseline . that 's what he 's all about - pulling out moments of magic like that when his back is against the wall ( almost literally in this case ) .
three sets , three first-attempt breaks of serve for federer . hanescu just can not get a foothold here .

oh my word . klizan breaks instantly and tsonga has it all to do . are we going to see one of the big shocks on the men 's side of the draw ?
sixth game and a sixth hold . have to say lopez has started this encounter well . murray has rarely looked like troubling him while serving .

it 's a commanding lead for djokovic now , although it is still just the one break . his response when in trouble on serve has been impressive today . istomin has been his typical inconsistent self , which just is n't good enough against the world 's best .
that 's a shocker from robredo . after getting to 0-15 , he frames a smash , and gasquet converts one of his own to move to 30-15. the number nine seed has began stepping into the court a little more , and it 's paying off , and he holds serve with a blistering backhand into the corner .

nope , it wo n't be costly . ferrer is still serving like a fiend and gets the hold thanks to a wayward tipsarevic forehand .
wowzers . there are plenty of nerves from murray . he 's just completely shanked a second serve . he follows that up with a neat one-two behind his first serve before he sends a serve out wide , also out of the reach of the czech . he opts for the middle with his next serve and it brings the same result for two game points , but after providing berdych with a tame second serve , the seventh seed is all over it . that could be something that we see on a regular basis . berdych gets to deuce with a beautiful forehand winner down the line but a miscued forehand and some phenomenal defensive work helps murray level the score .

now , far be it from me to accuse djokovic of over exaggerating an injury , but there was no sign of a limp in that game as he started to win points ! in the game before , he looked to his box to suggest that he was in trouble , yet he 's broken back ! it was a poor game from murray as well , who may have lost some concentration .
nadal serves up a double fault early in the game , but recovers with an ace before kyrgios hits his forehand to the net and the world number one wraps up up with a forehand winner . the second seed can level the match if he can break the australian in the next game , although he has n't had a break point yet today .

nice and simple from almagro as an ace gives him the hold of serve .
that 's the wawrinka that started this match ! he 's picked up the pace from the baseline and dictated the majority of those rallies as he broke with nadal on 15. the point that secured the break saw him play an unstoppable forehand down the line . he 's now just two games away from his first ever grand slam title . it 's a test of his nerves .

that was not the time to be broken to love , but that is the position that wawrinka finds himself in . he was on the cusp of glory , but an error-strewn service performance resulted in nadal claiming that break back at the first time of asking . the spaniard did n't even have to produce anything special during that game , which will be the most frustrating factor for wawrinka . will he rue those errors ?

'' at himself . he was right , too . two more mistakes from murray gift the game to his opponent .
well the knee certainly does n't seem to be troubling stepanek as moves around behind the baseline effortlessly to ease through the first game of the first set . he 's sticking with his tactic of coming into the net once in a while to keep the top seed on his toes , and it seems to be working well for him at the moment .
monfils secures the first hold of serve in six games , and must now be favourite to take the third set .

nieminen 's focus seems to have dropped , allowing djokovic to attack on the return , forcing three long balls in a row from the finn to bring up a chance for a double break for the serb . nieminen sprints along the baseline to try to keep himself in the game , but djokovic hits another potent overhead smash to secure the game . he 'll be serving for the set next .
there were serious questions asked of djokovic during that kevin anderson match in the last round - and indeed after the french open - but he is looking in increasingly good form here . cilic makes him wait to seal the match by storming back from 0-30 down to hold , but you get the feeling that he has merely delayed the inevitable here . the croat has not had a break point yet , and now he must win against djokovic 's serve to stay in this match .
it 's looking very comfortable now for federer as he swiftly wraps up another service game to love .
nadal finds himself under a bit of pressure at 15-30. however , he then switches to ultra-agressive mode , displaying expert agility at the net and holding to 30 .

`` game murray , '' as the scot puts away the easiest of volleys at the net . he 's still yet to present verdasco with a break-point opportunity in his three service games .
no he ca n't . tsonga misses his first serve , but federer 's back hand is fractionally to low , and gets caught on the net . tsonga follows with his 20th ace of the match , followed by another big serve to take an epic game . federer will now serve for the match .

frustration for nadal , who wastes his previous good work with a hat-trick of errors to allow djokovic to hold to 30 .
a run of unforced errors from almagro brings up a set point for nadal , but he ca n't make the most of it as almagro gets the better of him in a baseline rally , sending a looping forehand cross court . a lacklustre slice from almagro gives the defending champion another chance though , but once again he saves it , before giving himself a chance to close the game out with a big serve , but his backhand was long on the next point . eventually , almagro brings up another advantage , and this time he wraps it up with a spectacular backhand from the baseline , landing it just inside the opposite corner . that was an important game for almagro to win , keeping the opening set close , but nadal will be serving for it next .

the spaniard looked to be losing his cool again there as petzschner holds . pretty sure he barked at the umpire over one call that did n't go his way .
more stellar play from gasquet to move 3-2 up . it 's far easier for him to win his service game than it is for wawrinka to win his . the frenchman is , in theory , halfway toward a massive scalp . i fancy him to take it , too . we 're heading into a huge last few games in this decider .
ferrer seems to lose all the accuracy on his serve , allowing bautista agut to attack on the return , forcing three unforced errors from the fourth seed . with two break points , the 25-year-old makes a brilliant return to the back of the court , and ferrer blasts the ball into the net .

however , there 's no need as it turns out . murray blows a 30-0 lead and haase gets a break back .
what a disappointing way to be broken as klizan double faults at 15-40 behind on serve . berdych is clearly fired up with that breakthrough and will now serve for the first set after 25 minutes of play .
and so he does . tsonga moves into court to put away a sampras-esque smash for 15-15 , but federer but two accurate first serves help the swiss to 40-15. the former world number one then moves in to smash a volley into the corner , and it 's 5-5. federer has lost just three points on serve during this set ...

all of a sudden , the pressure is on wawrinka . a double fault from the swiss gives falla a bit of an opening at 15-15 , but a forehand winner from the eighth seed catches the line . however , falla gets a bit of luck from a net cord , and that 's followed up by a wayward shot from wawrinka to hand falla break point , but wawrinka remains composed to unleash a huge forehand from the baseline , and he holds when falla fails to catch the inner tramline .

petzschner has his eyes on taking this second set now as an ace gives him the hold . almagro serving to stay in the set .
it 's more of the same from wawrinka , who comfortably takes the first two points , but federer misses out on the next when given a chance to put away a forehand . the swiss number two eventually hold to 15 when bludgeoning another forehand to the other end of the court that leaves federer with no answer .

strong service from djokovic , who forces his opponent into errors before taking a 40-0 lead . the serb takes the game as lopez hits a forehand shot out wide .
four from four in breaks becomes five from five . incredible conversion rate from almagro and he earned that one with a couple of huge backhands . pressure right back on ferrer .
physically , murray looks to be struggling as he finds the net twice in quick succession to hand djokovic a 15-30 lead . however , he is then let back in by the serb , who commits an unforced error . in the next point , though , djokovic reads the second serve and gives himself a break opportunity . not for the first time , murray then sends his forehand stroke into the net and is broken . it looks a long way back for murray now - he 's got to dig deep .
strong hold from ferrer , to follow suit . if nothing gives here we 're going to a tie-break , and that looks quite likely at the moment .

ferrer is clearly livid at having lost his early break , and is immediately on the attack , making some superb returns to force a 40-15 lead . he tries too hard with an attempted forehand , blasting the ball long , before bautista agut makes a brilliant drop shot to take the game to deuce . the 25-year-old digs deep to force advantage , and seals the game with a well-executed volley . he 's recovered well from a shaky start to this match .
the scot has the chance to level things at 15-15 , but he rushes the net and smashes beyond the baseline ... poor tennis . murray is then wrong-footed following a long rally , which allows kyrgios to lead 40-0. murray grabs one back , though , as more rallying sees andy pull the cutter and the australian throws a return into the net . more clever work from the scot stops kyrgios returning from deep . an audacious cut of his own , this time at real pace , gives the youngster the game . what a shot !
nadal starts the second set with a solid hold of serve , opening the set with an ace before a couple of long returns from kyrgios hand him the game .
two lengthy rallies are shared , before kohlschreiber commits an unforced error . djokovic hits the ball into the net twice in succession to hand his opponent game point , and the serb repeats the act to hand kohlschreiber the game , which draws a frustrated response from the world number one .

it 's back on serve on hisense as verdasco breaks right back !
murray reaches 0-15 when pospisil nets a volley off a return , and that soon becomes 0-30 when the canadian sends a forehand wide . two huge serves from pospisil get him back to 30-30 , before some sharp work at the net helps him earn a game point . a super one-two off serve sees him regain the lead , and although murray missed out from 0-30 , pospisil won that game rather than murray losing it .
however , he 's powerless to resist once more , despite djokovic serving the first double fault of the match . now murray must hold to go to a breaker , or he 's lost the opening set .

kyrgios hits three more aces past the second seed to wrap up another game , and guarantee at least a tiebreak from the first set .

well , almagro will at least avoid the dreaded bagel in the third set as he puts in a solid serve game , sealing it with a powerful forehand . it leaves nadal serving for the match next .
djokovic is still looking for the break , taking a 30-0 lead again , but once again muller gets back on level terms with some superb serving , including a bold second serve to the top seed 's body . he mis-cues a volley though to give djokovic a break point , although the world number one fails to convert with an overhit backhand . he saves another break point with an ace down the middle of the court . the errors return for muller though as he misses two backhands in a row to hand djokovic the break , and leave the four-time champions serving for a two-set lead next .
psychologically , that was a hammer blow to nadal , and he looks a little deflated as djokovic moves into a 30-0 lead . however , he is soon encouraged when his opponent plays two wild shots to get the game back to 30-30. all of a sudden , there is a lull in djokovic 's play and another wayward backhand gives nadal a break point . the left-hander ca n't take advantage though , and two errors and a djokovic winner sees us reach 4-4 .
break back ! murray saves the first with a forehand winner but dumps a backhand into the net on the second and we 're back level in the set .
roger gets into a spot of bother with some average return work that flies wide , but replies on the rush to fire deep into the corner on a serve and volley . the world number two goes again , this time to send a poor attempted winner beyond the baseline . it goes all wrong for roger when he spoons a laughable effort into the crowd , although wawrinka can not take the break point . federer serves up a memorable ace before eventually taking the hold .

there is fight in hewitt yet ! tipsarevic 's winners have deserted him , as has his luck . a net chord brings him in and hewitt duly produces a backhand lob to set up a winner .
just as he did earlier in the set , kokkinakis reacts well to missing break point by holding serve comfortably - this time to 15 .
what a start to the tie-break . robredo earns the mini-break with a forehand winner , but gasquet replies in kind with a ridiculous backhand from behind the baseline . it 's gasquet who has the mini-break after a net cord sends a robredo shot wide , and the spaniard 's frustration grows when a return misses its target . a smash from gasquet takes the score to 4-1 , but robredo stops the rot when his opponent goes long .

federer manages just one return against the tsonga serve in the game , which takes less than a minute . the world number eight has been deadly on serve in this second set .
this is simply sublime from wawrinka . he crushes two absolutely marvellous winners past a floundering federer to earn a set point and it 's taken when federer frames a backhand . the world number two looks despondent and i do n't blame him . this is brilliant from his swiss rival .
murray seems to have found another level in the last few moments as he quickly moves 0-30 ahead following two net shots from golubev in quick succession . golubev does move onto the board after demonstrating delicate hands at the net , but murray sets up two break points when his opponent fires wide . golubev refuses to be beaten , however , and levels it at deuce . eventually murray secures the break when golubev nets from close range .
there 's a little bit of carelessness from murray as he sends a forehand stroke wide to allow djokovic to close the gap to 30-15. however , djokovic then returns the favour by sending a forehand of his own into the tramline . the next point goes the way of djokovic , but a smart backhand down the line sees murray claim a much needed hold .
as my colleague liam pointed out to me , lopez has lost it mentally . he double faults to hand murray the break . this looks like it 's going only one way now .

groans from the crowd on ashe as roddick slams a forehand into the net . fognini has the break .
the 31-year-old holds serve with another magnificent shot . this time it 's a backhand volley on the run that lands right in the corner . stakhovsky thinks about challenging but he knows it 's in and is just amazed .
it 's an equally strong hold from djokovic , who establishes a 40-0 lead in next to no time . a love service hold is completed with a one-two off his serve .
but tsonga holds , and he 's now just one game from taking a one-set lead .
ferrer looks empty and djokovic capitalises on this by sending his opponent all around the court , eventually earning him three break points , which takes the top seed to an easy 3-0 lead in the third set .
ferrer really goes for it , coming well inside the baseline to take the returns , forcing dolgopolov to stay at the back of the court . the ukrainian hands the fourth seed the game when he smashes his forehand well long .
murray smashes a routine smash into the net on the first point - a shocking mistake - but he replies with a backhand winner down the line . something just is n't right with murray , who records his 18th unforced error in sending a forehand into the net . he comes perilously close to double-faulting but takes the point when dimitrov nets to get back to 30-30 , but dimitrov earns break point after some blistering shots from the baseline . this is a must-win point for murray , and he takes it with a cute volley at the net . it 's another break point to dimitrov , though , and it 's taken when murray slices long . the defending champion is in big , big danger of going two sets behind .
stepanek comes in from the baseline to take his returns early and put his opponent under pressure , earning himself two break point . djokovic hits a fast serve to save the first before forcing deuce after a string of well-timed groundstrokes . he misses his first chance to win the game when he fires a backhand wide , but he creates another chance and manages to escape with his serve intact as stepanek hits the net with his forehand . that will be a bitter disappointment for the world number 38 who surely must have thought he had the game in the bag at 40-15 .
the top seed is forced to work hard but still earns a hold that edges him back ahead . reynolds continues to chase down every single point and that has to admired , but i do expect him to tire if he continues to set that pace .

it 's imperative that sousa avoids falling an early break of serve behind in this second set and when he drops to 0-30 , it looks as though that could be the case . however , out of nowhere , he records four points in a row , mainly down to murray mistakes , and he should feel a lot more comfortable after that .

a little better from cilic to start as he scores early , but some brute force from djokovic has him back level after some great footwork and placement over the net . the scores move when novak invites the smash , only for cilic to stifle himself at 30-30. hmm a double fault gives novak another break chance , which is soon snatched away following a wonderful croatian ace . cilic eventually works towards his first game point of the match , only for another mistake to allow deuce . the current champ eventually sees out the hold to claim his first game of the contest , weird .
tsonga shows a touch of delicacy with a drop shot after some baseline shots and federer goes long with the reply . at 15-40 he fires a cross-court forehand winner , too . a rare mistake from federer sees him hit the net with a forehand from the baseline and then he goes wide to gift tsonga his second break point . this time he takes it ! really poor from federer there when he was up 40-15 and he has been punished .
an ace , right on cue , gives ferrer a hard-earned game . he found the very edge of the line there and spun it away from nishikori .
poor cilic , he can not do a thing right at the moment . he produces a forehand error on his own serve , before continuing into the net to go 30-0 behind . an ace gives him a chance at 30-15 and he takes it as novak comes up short on a simple exchange . continued poor return from cilic sees him in trouble at 40-30 ... and as you guessed it , djokovic pounces to grab with exquisite rally placement .
murray is n't wasting any time today . he holds to 15 and haase reallly does n't look like getting on the scoreboard at the moment .
it 's important from here onwards for murray to keep his level of intensity up , but after sharing the first four points , he dumps a shot into the net and it is break point from becker . however , the us open champion responds with an ace . after they move to the third deuce , becker creates another chance , but again , a strong first serve gets murray out of trouble and he seals the opening game of the second set . it 's all happening on court one , where rafael nadal has fallen two sets and a break behind to steve darcis !

a badly-timed volley and a long forehand allow tsonga to take a 30-0 lead . a few mistakes from the fifth seed allow federer to get back in to the game , but tsonga hits a superb volley to take the game to deuce . he brings up break point with a breathtaking cross-court forehand which just clips the sideline , leaving federer rooted to the spot . a long forehand from federer gives tsonga the break back . the swiss started this set looking strong , but has crumbled over the last couple of games .
now then . djokovic fires long and surrenders his serve very easily for a second time . the defending champion is n't quite with it at the moment , while ferrer is his usual frenetic self .
that 's classy from haas , who sends a single-handed backhand down the line , but he goes on to make errors on both sides to hand his opponent 15-30. he does well to avoid conceding two sets points by forcing djokovic into a forehand error , which he builds on with a stunning first serve . that 's quite a response from haas , who seals the game when djokovic sends a return long .
djokovic sends down his first ace of the match to lead 15-0 , but two mistakes give murray an opening at 15-30. a well-directed second serve gets djokovic out of trouble for now , but murray secures another break point with a fine backhand return . it 's saved excellently , though , when djokovic serves and volleys for the first time tonight and he comes through in confident fashion . murray has had chances to break in all three service games , but he has only converted once .
matosevic establishes a 30-15 lead before he is on the end of some bad luck off a net cord to allow federer back into the game . the swiss then produces a stunning top-spin lob that beats the australian , but he saves the first break point of the match when federer nets . matosevic saves another with an ace down the middle , but two double faults in a row and federer has the break !

it looks like muller is going to start the second set with a relatively straight-forward service game , but djokovic produces a superb backhand to keep himself in the game . muller halts any hopes of an early break for the top seed though , wrapping it up with a powerful forehand inside the baseline .
nadal fires wide in the opening point of the fifth game to leave djokovic 0-15 ahead , but the spaniard hits a wonderful passing shot moments later to level the scores . nadal then moves 30-15 ahead following another sensational exchange , before djokovic fires long to hand nadal game point . the spaniard indeed takes it to move 4-1 ahead in the fourth .
nice and easy for nadal to get on the board in the second . his first serve has been very good so far and when he gets it in he usually gets the point . monfils went for the big return again but put it out of play . it 's crucial for him not to be broken here .

the net-cord has n't been djokovic 's friend today . at 30-15 , djokovic looks ready to hit a forehand winner for 30-30 , but it hits the net and goes wide . however , he remains focused to take the next two points for deuce , but a poor backhand goes wide and djokovic is furious - he thumps his racquet into the ground . but , he channels his frustration positively to bring up a break point , but nadal steps into court with a precise drop shot before taking the next two points , much to the anger of the serb .
goffin races to a 30-0 lead with some superb play at the net , but tsonga fights back with a couple of well-timed returns . however , the 22-year-old manages to wrong-foot tsonga behind the baseline to seal the game . this opening set is still with serve .
another miscue from federer and that 's a massive moment - the first break of the match .
dolgopolov is moving fantastically but he ca n't match monfils , who has found another gear in the last few minutes . some fantastic returns from the frenchman lead to the 18th seed putting the ball in the net on break point , and now monfils will serve for the match .
dimitrov open with a forehand winner before coming into the net later in the game for a stunning overhead smash . he keeps djokovic in the game when he hits his forehand into the net on the next point . both players end up on the ground as they dive for volleys at the net , but it 's dimitrov who comes out on top to seal the game .
i did n't see this coming after the first set . sousa holds to love for a second time in succession and murray is growing a little frustrated with himself . he needs to find a way of discouraging sousa because his confidence is growing .
it 's another simple service game for murray , who is now just three games away from the final . i 'm sure he has n't , but berdych looks like he has given up .

we 've been treated some quite ridiculous shots this morning and kyrgios adds to the collection with a backhand flick from the back of the court that catches the line . murray misses out on a chance for 30-30 and that allows kyrgios to ease to a hold to 15 .
kyrgios will have to serve to keep himself in the set again as nadal hits a series of solid forehand winners past the australian .

ace number 20 for isner ensures malisse is n't celebrating , yet .

kokkinakis is certainly going for his shots . the young man does not seem at all fazed by the occasion . nadal holds to 15 and looks very comfortable with his opponent 's approach , but , if the aussie keeps playing the same way , he may well nick a break at some point today , which would a great memento to take away .

sloppy approach to the net from the frenchman and tipso slashes a passing forehand into the empty space , presumably saying `` thank you '' for making a vital service game quite so easy .

that was a much-needed hold from nishikori . evans helps him out with two unforced errors , but a fine drop-shot was impressive from the world number 12. evans is showing so much desire in this match , and he records three points in a row to get back to deuce , but he goes for too much on a second-serve return , before slicing the ball into the net .
it 's another easy hold for del potro . can he challenge the djokovic serve once again ?
again , it 's a real battle of power as dimitrov races to a big lead , forcing his opponent all over the place . the bulgarian gave the serb a chance of taking the game to deuce when he blasted an effort into the crowd . dimitrov held on though to take his first game .
well , that was emphatic . nadal has really improved his first serve in recent years and that was out in force just now . each one went wide and had plenty of kick , which wawrinka could simply return straight to the spaniard , who tucked away the next shot . one game apiece .
he 's so dominant on his serve federer . i just can not see how paire can get back in this without having even a glimpse of a look at the swiss 's serve .

important hold for gulbis after those two break points .
i ca n't quite get over how subdued the crowd are . maybe they were expecting to see the richard gasquet match on philippe chatrier and they feel short-changed ? there is a bit more energy about nishikori in this game , hitting back to make it 30-30 , and he has break point when nadal goes wide , but he disappointingly hits the ball into the net , and loses the following two points to concede the game .
right now , it 's difficult to see how federer is going to break wawrinka . the eighth seed is not giving the 2009 champion a look in on his serve as he races to another hold to 15 .
ferrer is looking to get in from the back of the court more , but dolgopolov does the same , delicately placing the ball past his opponent . the spaniard goes for a drop shot , but it drops before it reaches the net , and a superb forehand down the sideline from dolgopolov leaves the fourth seed facing break point . dolgopolov tries too hard on the return to bring up deuce , before ferrer claims advantage with an ace . the fourth seed gets the hold when his opponent slices the ball into the net . it 's been a pretty cagey start to this deciding set .
that said , he may not have the biggest serve but gasquet has performed relatively well behind his own delivery . a couple of neat forehand conversions help him to an easy hold , but he needs to find a way to break the serbian 's serve , something that he has n't done since the third game of the match .
nadal 's first serve is return to the net , while an ace puts the sixth seed 30-15 up . almagro fights hard to try to keep himself in contention , attacking at the net to force an error from the sixth seed , but a couple of wayward backhands from the world number 154 hand nadal the game .
this set is a battle of wits and both are holding their own serve thus far - but can it last ? one mistake will be fatal i reckon . if there 's one cause for concern it 's gasquet 's service , which has looked erratic . he 's conceded three double faults in this match - and another one in that previous game after being 40-0 up , but he survived it .
haas again with a strong service game . it does n't look likely to let him down again and nieminen serves to save the set once more .
ferrer is just one game away from the final after holding to 30. court philippe chatrier is flat , as was the bounce on the baseline that bamboozled tsonga on game point .
- what a point ! drop shots , baseline hits and even a volleyed lob from rafa are what it took to take that one ! set one tie-break
it 's a quick start to the game from murray , who never gives djokovic a moment to settle and pick his spot . the scot uses the court ever so well , hitting three winners before sealing the third game with an ace . meanwhile , here 's jamie murray - andy 's brother - on twitter : 2hrs 30mins for 2 sets . these guys are a different breed . who can continue to keep this level longest ? # ausopen — jamie murray ( @ jamie_murray ) february 1 , 2015
and he takes it to win his first game for over three quarters of an hour . despite that , he continues to grimace and hold his groin .
nope . a forehand from djokovic this time does n't make it into court and del potro similarly hangs on to his serve after being pegged back to 40-30 .
rochus comes back from losing the first set to hold to love . ferrer had no answer to his accurate serving and confident forehand .
what a way to record your first point . nadal attempts a passing shot at the net but rosol directs a sharp volley cross-court that nadal ca n't reach . rosol gets to 30-0 but an error and a delightful nadal forehand soon sees the spaniard back into the game . however , that 's more clinical from the czech , who steps into court to put away a couple of forehands .
djoko goes one better than the opening game by holding to love , wrapping up the game with a lovely one-two punch . he kicks a serve out to del potro 's backhand before arrowing a backhand winner down the line . gorgeous .
anderson keeps his cool after missing out on those three set points to force ferrer into taking us into a tie-break .

the serb comes through another service game without any problems , with reynolds unable to return anything on his opponent 's consistent first serve . after just four points the american is straight back under pressure on serve , with the top seed needing a single game to claim this second set .
a defiant no , from djokovic . the serb holds to love and just as the last set we 're staying with serve . it was at this point in the first , of course , that djokovic managed his break .
if anybody is in and around the wimbledon area there 's a free tennis ball sitting beside the path in your estate , because gasquet has just put it there with a terrible return that most probably flew out of the stadium . other than that , it was a solid service game and he levels up the set .
djokovic takes a little over a minute to notch up another game , with dimitrov struggling to return his serves , and the top seed adding another ace , he 's up to 15 in this match now .

there was a possibility that federer might become intimidated by the heavy-hitting of his compatriot , but he has n't wilted whatsoever . a hold to love and wawrinka must serve to remain in the set .

an efficient game from federer sees him hold to 15. the concluding point was a joy to behold , with federer finishing it off with a forehand scoop at the net that caught the line .
the two players have taken their time to find their feet since returning to court before the start of the fourth set , but an intense rally at 40-15 indicates that they are ready to up the intensity . robredo won that exchange , but he loses the game as gasquet moves back in front .
nadal runs around his forehand in the opening point to move 15-0 ahead , before a stunning backhand moves the spaniard 30-0 ahead . just stunning from both players , who are putting on some show this early evening in new york . it quickly becomes 40-0 as djokovic is unable to meet a delicate placement from the spaniard , before djokovic fires long to hand the game to nadal .
cilic records back-to-back aces for a 30-0 lead but he fires long of the baseline with a miscued backhand . it 's a momentarily lapse from the croatian though , who holds to 15 after a nishikori error .
despite the pressure from murray , janowicz comes through that tough service game to consolidate the break with another ace . he had three in that game alone . one less than he 'd had in the entire game before that .
federer seeks to lay down his attentions with aggressive attacking play at the net , but novak replies with a strong volley from the middle . the serb tries to lob federer , who returns with a brutal point on the smash . a stunning whip is then produced by djokovic down into the corner as the scores move level . novak produces a forehand error , leaving federer to claim the game when his opponent 's return finds the mesh .
shift in power once more ? ! nadal moves 15-0 ahead as djokovic nets from inside the baseline , before djokovic fires long to hand nadal a two-point lead . the world number one then misses a simple volley to hand his opponent three game points - the second of which is taken as nadal keeps this one on serve .

really strong hold from stepanek , who finishes off the game with his first ace of the set . now , can he get a look at the djokovic serve here ? he has to soon or he 's out .
matosevic takes the opening point and he should arguably move to 40-0 ahead . however , a sublime cross-court forehand from federer and miscued smash from matosevic see the second seed bring up 15-30 , but a fired-up matosevic takes three points in a row to hold serve . very impressive stuff from the underdog .

stunning from djokovic . he saves three break points before going on to hold . he 's looking very good right now . ferrer serving to stay in the set , but this one looks well beyond his reach .
nadal tries to hit back against the czech and he manages to win the first point with a good strike to force the error . however , berdych 's next two serves are right on the money are the spaniard can barely lay a racquet on them before they fly past his outstretched hand . the czech does it again before firing an ace down the middle , and there 's not much rafa can do about that , but acknowledge excellent play from berdych .
verdasco continues to show his mettle by holding to 15 , sealing the game with an ace out-wide that sends up a puff of white paint to show that it was in .

federer hangs in tight to win the second set after a thrilling tiebreak . he came back from the brink a few times in that extra period . novak might have let him off once or twice , and that could be viewed as a huge opportunity missed by the current champion .
golubev claims the first point of the game when murray fires wide , before the scot hits a forehand long to leave the server with a 30-0 lead . another wide forehand allows golubev to move 40-0 ahead and the 26-year-old secures the hold with a backhand down the line .

break back ! it 's back on serve in this one after tipsarevic hits a woeful forehand wide and long .
break and set ! oh no this is poor from wawrinka , whose service game buckles at the wrong time . brilliant tennis saw gasquet move 40-15 ahead , before a double fault from the swiss saw his french counterpart snatch the fourth set ! i honestly thought we were heading to a tiebreak . i could n't see either breaking serve ! two sets apiece and this is nicely poised . let 's have a decider !

good stuff from stakhovsky as he outhits federer from the baseline to yet again level the set .
more early aggression from berydch there but his opponent just does enough to claim an important early hold for his confidence . the seventh seed is definitely hammering the ball today at every opportunity , so expect short points at either end of the court .

tomic eats up his final challenge as he questions a call on the sideline to no avail . that error in judgement is used to full effect by berdych , who climbs ahead in the second set .
pretty casual stuff on serve proves enough for djokovic to earn his first hold to love . a pair of forehand 's slapped down the line were fairly impressive there from the top seed , who looks completely at home out on centre court .
a worthy effort at a cross-court winner sprays just wide klizan , allowing berdych off the hook as the first set stays on serve . i 'd just like to see the seventh seed show more variety by coming in to the net on crucial points like that , but he looks resistant to change and relies on a punishing array of shots at the baseline .

falla moves to 5-2 thanks to another wayward wawrinka shot , but a falla mistake and a big forehand from wawrinka moves the score to 5-4. that 's brave again from falla , who serves-and-volleys for the umpteenth time to move to two set points , and he takes the first after wawrinka goes wide ! we are heading into a fourth set on the margaret court arena .
it 's a much simpler hold for federer who puts together four successive points . we are going into a tie-break !
djokovic opens with his second ace of the match before wawrinka fails to find the target with a couple of baselines efforts . a love hold is completed with a big serve out wide . just one returning point recorded so far in three games .

a poor first point suggests that gasquet might have thrown in the towel as far as this second set is concerned , but another backhand passing shot suggests otherwise . he holds to 30 to force the world number one to serve for a two-set lead .
first set dimitrov ! the 22nd seed reels off four straight points to get out of danger and become the first person to take a grand slam set from nadal in 2014. a nerveless overhead smash made it 15-30 , before two aces and a service winner wrapped up a crucial hold to 30 .
ferrer attacks from the baseline at the start of the game , before delivering a couple of fast serves . bautista agut digs deep to get a couple of points on the board , but he then hits the ball into the net to hand the game to ferrer . could we be heading to another tiebreak ?
impressive start by dimitrov . he wins a 12-stroke rally behind his second serve to move 30-0 in front before nadal fails to return another huge first serve . the spaniard then cracks a forehand winner , but a second ace from dimitrov seals a confident hold to 15 .
murray should be 0-40 ahead , but two careless shots see rola hold a 30-15 lead . the scot then proceeds to spray a couple of shots long of the baseline and rola has avoided the bagel . he looks pleased with that .
berdych opens with a forehand error and he 's fortunate to avoid falling 0-30 behind after framing a smash . however , murray has 15-30 after a net-cord helps his return , before a wild double fault gives murray two break points . berdych gets into next rally but he eventually goes long to hand murray the break !
three games in a row for verdasco as he booms his sixth ace of the match to hold .
federer 's pace is too much for davydenko to handle , as he races to another easy service hold .
another easy hold for wawrinka . he takes the first three points without reply , and although he sends a forehand into the net , robredo misses the target on the next .
djoko is once again the man serving first in the third set and he edges ahead with a hold to 15 .
that could be the turning point in the game and does n't it mean a lot to him ? he has really stepped up his game since losing that third set and i fully expect him to see it out now .
just superb stuff from the seven-time french open champion . brands is comfortably able to return his opponents serve , but struggles to move around the court quickly enough when nadal starts looking to the sidelines . nadal races to 40-0 , before sealing the game with a perfectly placed forehand down the left-hand side of the court .

untidy start from nadal as the world number one hits the net for 0-15 , but the spaniard responds with a powerful volley from the middle of the court . the pair then exchange points for 30-30 , with nadal missing the chance to push home his advantage . the spaniard regains the advantage , however , with a brilliant forehand , but klizan shows wonderful hands at the net to level it at deuce . nadal then fires long to hand klizan advantage and the slovakian breaks when nadal hits the net .
no . it wo n't . it 's power and finesse rolled into one game for tsonga , who takes his fourth love service game with a big backhand followed by a volley into the space he had opened up . federer must hold now to take us into a tie-break .
just one point earned against janowicz 's serve in open play so far , with another procession keeping this first set deadlocked . time for one of these two unheralded quarter-finalists to make a move and wrestle control of the match .
gasquet looks on course for a comfortable opening hold , but 30-0 soon becomes 30-30. the frenchman reaches game point when djokovic misses out with a backhand , but it 's deuce after a gasquet double fault . the underdog comes through , though , after firing an ace down the middle .
set tsonga ! federer is wide with a forehand and tsonga has another look-in and this time the ball flies off the edge of the swiss 's racquet ! first blood tsonga !
strong first serves from reynolds keep this match on serve . surviving those break-point chances should be enough to ease early nerves for the 30-year-old , but he must cut those unforced errors out at the baseline as a matter of urgency .
murray will feel that he had the chance to earn a set point in that game . he could n't though and djokovic puts away a backhand winner to force the scot to serve it out . massive game coming up .
at 30-30 , murray comes into the net for a drop shot , which goffin stretches to return , but ca n't return to the other side of the court to reach murray 's volley , which gives the defending champion a chance for another break . goffin forces the game to deuce , before digging deep to see out the game with an overhead smash . he 's still a break down in this set , but is n't out of it yet .
goffin takes a rare lead in a murray service game when the brit sends his forehand just wide before the belgian beats him with a solid return . however , murray ups his game , firing the fastest serve of the match so far at 121mph past the world number 105 .

murray brilliantly converts a backhand volley at the net but a wild forehand sees djokovic back at 15-15. the 2012 winner is struggling a little now , and a double fault and a backhand into the net give djokovic two break points , and despite murray improving during the next rally , the top seed breaks after latching onto a murray drop shot .
game three is all about dimitrov , as he hits two aces , an unreturnable 219kph serve and a double fault en route to holding to 30 .
murray has struggled to read the sousa match throughout this contest but at 30-0 down , he picks one and puts it away . sousa then throws in a double fault before murray gets the better of the next exchange to earn a break point . he gets a look at a second serve and that 's enough for him to set the wheels in motion to over-power his opponent . that could be a huge moment in this match .
tsonga could do with an immediate response , and he had a glimmer of a chance when forcing federer to net at 15-15. however , that 's as good as it gets for the number 10 seed , and a forehand winner and a perfectly-timed drop-shot helps seal the game . after just 88 minutes , federer is three service holds away from the last eight .
more good defensive work from djokovic , who is just so good at getting to shots he has no right to reach . a poor attempted lob allows cilic to take the first point , however , while the big man shows a deft touch to secure the next with a pick-up shot at the net . two more quick points follow for a love game .
federer easily holds his serve again , and now needs just one game to progress to the third round .
gasquet saunters into a comfortable lead in this second set . tsonga needs to gather himself , and quick . he can still do something in this one , but at the very least ca n't let this rot last for two sets .
the two players begin the game with undoubtedly the point of the match . the rally must have exceeded 20 shots , before murray whipped a forehand winner past mayer . the next two points are shared before the scot sends down his fifth ace , following it up with a backhand winner .
how frsutrating for murray , not to mention those of us following . he slams a weak forehand into the net and lopez has a break back .
yet another berdych winner as he crashes nadal 's back past before he knows it . nadal gets himself back on track with a well worked point , but again he makes a poor mistake on double fault to give the czech control of the game . berdych wins two break points as he opens the court with a lovely backhand slice to force nadal out wide before crashing a forehand past him . nadal reduces the deficit , but yet again another double fault from the spaniard gives the number seven seed the game . this is not the nadal we are used to seeing !
it is a fairly simple hold for novak , who has to revert to some adroit play on his second service at times . an ace and brutal forehand help him on his way to a 40-15 lead , before the game is capped off with the truest of backhands straight down the line to catch cilic cold .
tsonga gets the first ace of the match , followed by the second and third as he quickly wraps up another comfortable service game . aside from in the third game of this set , goffin has shown little aggression against the frenchman 's serve .
a wonderful defensive effort earn djokovic the break of serve and sixth successive game . the pendulum has swung in the serb 's favour and he lets out a huge roar of approval after winning that game .
stan 's backhand is something else . if the whole tennis thing does n't work out he could probably be a very successful pimp . it 's that backhand which helps him into a break of serve with a few ferocious returns that has gasquet scrambling all around the court to reach the shots . he 's warming to the task now , you feel .
the key to federer getting back into this match is avoiding exchanges that advance past 10 shots , and that 's something that happened too much in the opener . despite losing a lengthy rally , he reaches 40-30 but a double fault gives djokovic deuce . federer gets back on the front foot , though , executing a one-two off his first serve to get the job done .
stepanek continues to look extremely solid on serve as he mixes up his shots with some efforts at the net as well as some groundstrokes , preventing djokovic from picking up a single point . already it feels like this set could be heading to same way as the last , ending with a tiebreak .
is there a better backhand in the men 's game than the one that wawrinka possesses ? the shot that he used to send a winner down the line to level up the score at 30 apiece would suggest that there is n't . he even gets a break point , but a wide serve from nadal forces deuce . the spaniard goes on to complete the job , but it 's a real escape .
break and set ! murray wants this set done and dusted , and he goes on the attack to move to 0-30 , but mayer strikes back with a big first serve for 30-30. however , the scot blazes a return winner past the german and he has set point , which he converts when mayer ca n't handle a barrage of groundstrokes from inside the court .
rosol looks a beaten man . nadal races into a 40-0 lead courtesy of a smash before rosol lets out his frustration in blasting another forehand wide of the mark .
first set nadal : the world number two holds to 15 and takes the opener 6-4 courtesy of a solitary break of serve .
federer opens up with the serve , but is thwarted by a poor return that hits the net . the veteran looks to rush the net at the next point , only for simon to cut another past him to send the 33-year-old 30-0 down . he 's soon back in it , though , with a comical smash at the net and he quickly moves back level with a standout ace . another beast of a serve takes federer ahead and another non-returnable service sees him close out the game .
break for golubev as the 26-year-old secures his first game . golubev gets on the board at 30-0 when murray hits the net , before producing a close-range volley to level at 30-30. a fine forehand then hands golubev break point , but he hits the net to leave another game at deuce . murray then double faults to leave golubev with another break point , but deuce two occurs when golubev fires long . eventually golubev breaks following two unforced errors from murray .
comfortable hold for sousa , who has a couple in a row on his own serve . bit of frustration from murray in that one ; i ca n't see what for , i think noise from the crowd . not sure how he heard anything , the atmosphere has been appalling today .
back on his own serve , federer takes control at 40-0 and closes the game out with a wonderful chip on the backhand that has simon all at sea . incredible dominance from the swiss in that service game .
tsonga deserves plenty of credit for remaining competitive in this match . he confidently holds to love to force federer to serve for the match . he made inroads on the swiss 's serve in his last service game . can he go one better this time around ?
yet another easy hold , this is starting to get a bit repetitive . this match needs a break point , the crowd are n't that in to it either at the moment , they need something to cheer .
brilliant play from novak to win that . wawrinka got lucky with a net cord shot , but the serb was in like a flash to dink it over the net and beyond the sprinting swiss . it 's a comprehensive first-set win and already this looks like it might be over quickly .
where has that come from ? rola plays a superb point before sending an inside-out forehand flashing past murray . it 's 15-15 , but murray responds with a flashing backhand effort of his own to edge ahead . is murray beginning to lose focus ? he concedes two points in a row to give a third break point to rola , but again , he comes up trumps with a one-two off his first serve . the minor blip is over when rola nets a return and the 27-year-old is two games away .
we go close to seeing wawrinka inflicted a broken service game , as he leads 40-30 with break point , but gasquet battles back gamely to survive ! tennis is a sport that takes a tonne of inner strength to negotiate the sternest of tests , and both players are being asked to dig deep here . very deep .
a third ace of the match gets murray back to 15-15 , but a net cord favours federer and he takes advantage to put away a forehand winner for 15-30. murray replies with a powerful backhand , before drilling another ace down the middle . murray holds with a forehand into the corner and he needed that .
some uncharacteristic errors from nadal get him into a hole at 15-30 , but he digs himself to safety with some much improved ball striking , eventually holding to 30 thanks to a trademark forehand topspin winner .

not the best start to the game from murray as the scot double faults to leave golubev 0-15 ahead . however , golubev then nets to leave the score at 15-15. golubev responds with a wonderful forehand to move ahead once more , but then misses a murray forehand as the score moves onto 30-30. the game heads for deuce when both exchange backhands and eventually golubev breaks with a powerful forehand .
verdasco does hold , forcing murray to serve the set out and send us into a decider . can he do it ?
it 's a much better service game from federer this time around . the world number two hits some fantastic shots to force errors from his opponent , and also finds a brilliant overhead forehead winner to keep the fourth set with serve .
can falla stop the rot ? the colombian continues to battle hard , but an immense backhand winner from wawrinka tells the world number 87 that he is going to need something special to stay in this match . it 's 15-30 , and wawrinka comes up with another piece of magic , blasting the ball down the line past a despondent falla . rather cheekily , wawrinka challenges a call after already playing the shot , but it goes against him , and falla is back at deuce . the colombian is forced to save another break point , but he comes through the game in superb fashion with a backhand into the corner that clipped the line .
djokovic holds to 40 following two cheap points .

nadal gets his first ace of the match , but a couple of clumsy errors allow klizan a 30-15 lead . nadal is putting much more power into his ground strokes , but gives it too much from behind the baseline to give klizan a chance to break back , which he does when nadal fires another shot long .
we are only six games in , and it feels as though nishikori is already feeling a little deflated . maybe he is still thinking about those two break points chances that he missed ? nadal cruises through the game , and it looks ominous .

aaaaaaaaaaand the swiss breaks back ! what a chance for gasquet , who trips up at the finish line as wawrinka digs very , very deep to win that game . he had a man in a pink shirt and pink trousers on his feet applauding at one stage , and he deserved it . he was 30-15 down , but three quite brilliant points saw him snatch the win . amazing .

berdych takes the lead and the mini-break with a strong forehand down the line , but the seventh seed frames a second serve to see the score return to 4-4. berdych is all over the next point , with a second smash getting the job done , but murray serves out wide to get to 5-5. this is a huge point . berdych looks in control but he nets to hand murray a set point , but it 's a superb reply from berdych , who steps in to put away a volley .
a final show of resistance perhaps on serve from tomic , who closes out a comfortable hold with a deft drop shot that has the court one crowd purring in admiration . berdych will now serve for the match , can the youngster go for broke and put a dent in the czech 's quite formidable first serve .
there it is , djokovic cruises to an unanswered game that wraps up the second set . it 's been one-way traffic for this match so far and the serb might not need too much longer before securing his spot in the next round .
likewise , a forehand into the net . he 's angry with himself , and he 's beating himself as much as ferrer is . a break at the first time of asking for ferrer , and this wo n't last much longer .
nadal holds to 15. djokovic must again serve to stay in the french open .
djokovic takes a lucky 30-0 lead as he mis-hits a cross-court volley , but sousa is n't quite fast enough as he makes the return . the serb is let down by a couple of errors at the net , hitting back-to-back backhands into the net to allow sousa to level the scores . the portuguese finally seems to be finding some rhythm as he comes into the net to smash his forehand past djokovic before a mistake from the world number two gives sousa the hold . djokovic looks a little sloppy during that game , which may have given his opponent hope of staying with him in the second set .
effortless hold to start the set for the spaniard . now he must make inroads into dodig 's serve - or at least start converting break points .
rafa consolidates his break by holding to 30. the spaniard is far from delighted though , having produced two double faults in that game .
a smash and ace take federer to 30-0 , but murray executes the perfect lob to halve the deficit . a serve-and-volley is enough for the second seed to reach two game points before a return is sent into the net .
pospisil has looked rejuvenated since the break and a double fault and baseline mistake from murray give him 0-30. murray is lucky to avoid three break points when the canadian sends a smash wide , before the world number 56 blasts a forehand return long . two more efforts into the net from pospisil hands murray the game .
mathieu is now serving very accurately . until of course a double-fault at 40-0. however , he responds magnificently with a deep , wide serve that asks too much of djokovic on the return .
djokovic is keen to get another look at the muller serve as quickly as possible as he fires three aces past the world number 42 on his way to a swift hold .
i get the impression that murray knows what he needs to do off the federer serve , but he is n't executing the plan at the moment . however , he is helped out by a couple of mistakes by his opponent , and the scot has 15-30. federer eases to 30-30 , but murray misses a huge opportunity for a break point when missing with a cross-court forehand return . that 's the chance come and gone .
it 's a 14th ace from ferrer that brings up the hold of serve . that game could prove pivotal .
that 's impressive from tsonga , who holds to 15 with three successive big serves . tsonga has n't played bad in this match , he 's just been blown away by an irresistible performance from federer . he 'll be waiting if the swiss 's level drops off .
goffin refuses to be intimidated by the figure of the serb advancing to the net and places a shot just out of his opponent 's reach . however , from 40-15 up the belgian is pegged back to deuce but he manages to hold on to take the opener .
stan the man eases to 30-0 , but for once , he misses with a forehand . murray ca n't latch onto a second serve though , and it 's two game points for wawrinka . we are just short of the two-hour mark and murray is on the verge of losing his grip on the us open trophy .
it 's a shocker of a start from wawrinka , who follows a bad mistake on a volley with a double fault , and although he halves the deficit , he gives djokovic two break points after being overpowered by the serbian . the first is saved emphatically , before djokovic squanders the second when a forehand goes long of the baseline . the swiss reaches game point , but djokovic remains active with an excellent forehand return . it 's not for long though , and an ace from wawrinka pulls him through .
federer is furious that a murray lob is n't called out , and the scot fires down a forehand winner for 0-15. that 's only gone and pumped the swiss up , and he aggressively puts away a forehand at the net . a 23-shot rally is fiercely fought , but federer prevails , only to send a backhand long . we are at 30-30. what next ? it 's set point to federer ! he missed with an attempted backhand winner after some fine work from the swiss , and federer is two sets up after murray goes long with a forehand pass . it 's an uphill task from here ...
at the moment , gasquet needs something special to break the robredo serve and two stunning baseline winners get him to 30-30. the frenchman brings up break point , and a sublime backhand winner down the line seals the break .
an error of judgement from federer allows robredo to move 0-15 ahead in the fifth game of the third set , but a smash from the former world number one then levels the score at 15-15. another federer ace makes it 30-15 , before robredo nets for 40-15. robredo gains his second point of the game when federer nets , but the swiss holds when robredo fires wide .
a hold to love . and in double-quick time too . just what was needed . this set is far from over .
wawrinka has n't given up that 's for sure . he hits a terrifyingly good return to derail nadal and force the deuce . he takes the advantage after nadal lazily swings into the net for a break point . the swiss hits his return long and out to restart the situation . after a bit of to-an-fro , nadal claims the first game of the third set . wawrinka is in trouble .
federer moves out 30-0 in front on novak 's serve following two errors from the serbian , who responds with a booming serve that undercuts federer . parity is reached with a service winner and then goes in front when federer crashes his return into the net . novak holds when federer booms long .
it 's a comfortable start for the fourth seed . nadal tries to defend from the baseline , but he hits a couple of strokes wide , before ferrer wraps his opening service game up with an ace .
it 's a comfortable hold for ferrer . he really needs to step up to the almagro serve here , because he 's not even testing it at the moment .
delicious angle on federer 's in-to-out forehand at 40-15 and he again moves within a game of the fourth . stakhovsky 's forehand is waning a little and federer may start to target it more .
it ca n't inspire the spaniard to a break though as murray finds two big serves to level the set once more .
we 've seen three big statements by gasquet already in this set . he is n't going quietly , and he dominates this fifth game on his own serve to move 3-2 ahead . he made some cracking return shots to have wawrinka running all around the court !
federer moves 15-0 ahead when djokovic hits a forehand long , before coming to the net to claim a 30-0 lead . djokovic then hits the net for 40-0 and roger holds with yet another ace .
isner continues to defy common sense by produce a blistering service game , can he deliver when returning for once ?
as expected , although monfils got a couple of points , lu wraps up the set with a bagel . he leads 2-1. monfils will continue somehow .
it 's a slow start to the set from murray who , after getting to 30-15 , slices a backhand out of court . out of nowhere , he throws in a double fault , and rola has the chance to break . guess what , though ? like last time , murray delivers an ace out wide . during the next point , which was being evenly contested , a ball drops out of murray 's pocket and they replay the point , but murray regains his composure to take the next two to hold serve .
double break ! this is really rather good from federer so early in the tournament . he makes it a double break in set two by putting away his 19th winner with a calm forehand up the line with hanescu way out of position . you ca n't even get odds on a federer victory any more .
verdasco with a much simpler hold to 15. his big serving has returned to him in this set and murray has n't looked like breaking yet . oh how murray would take an easy service game right now .
an eighth ace and a murray winner earn the number eight seed 30-0 , but djokovic reads a drop shot and fires his response . like earlier in the set , a 69mph second serve is given the treatment by djokovic for 30-30 before murray explodes into life with a crushing forehand to earn game point and he repeats the feat to force djokovic to have to serve to remain in the set .
djokovic 's semi-compliant slump continues as he falls 15-40 behind on his own serve . however , he responds by digging in to finally put a game on the board in set three .
djokovic breaks : sousa is attempting to be as aggressive as possible . that decision is pleasing the fans , as it is contributing to some attractive tennis . however , it is pleasing djokovic even more . the serb is being played at his own game and this is allowing him to pick his opponent off with superb accuracy . he breaks to 40 .
some early pressure from murray in the game ends with that outrageous diving point , and the serb wraps up the game comfortable . again he came to the net in the final point , he has done a few times so far today .
a huge roar from janowicz as a deep forehand return at the baseline pays off , earning a vital break at the fourth time of asking . the giant polish number one will now serve for the first set as kubot just gets a touch too predictable at the net .
well murray seems to have forgotten about the match point . after reaching 15-40 , he spends the point on the defensive before unleashing a ridiculous backhand passing shot from the back of the court . the reaction says it all .
wawrinka 's frustration is for all to see after missing out on an opportunity to reach 0-30 , but he gets a break point when robredo goes wide . the next rally is the longest of the match , but wawrinka comes out on top with a brute of a forehand into the corner to establish an early break .
oh my . djokovic produces the most scintillating of reactive lobs to flummox murray to lead 0-15 and it gets worse for murray as he dumps a forehand into the net . murray fights back superbly with an ace and a 129mph first serve down the middle to earn game point and he holds for the first time tonight when djokovic goes long .
sousa continues his resurgence with a confident hold to love . he 's leaving nothing to chance when the ball is fired in short and the uncompromising approach looks his best chance of getting anything out of this encounter .
ferrer is stretched behind the baseline , and dolgopolov comes in for a volley , but his completed mis-judges it and fires it long , bringing up two break points for ferrer . his first attempt to convert goes wide , but dolgopolov misses the target on the next point to give ferrer the break .
could this be the moment ? djokovic takes the first point with another winner from a drop shot , before he beats the german at the net . haas then makes an error from the baseline and it is three break points for the world number one . he wastes no time in forcing the 35-year-old back , and haas goes long to edge nearer to defeat .
wonderful from almagro . the cheekiest of sliced drop shots sees him hold to make it 4-4 .
djokovic races to a 30-0 lead , before lopez recovers with a forehand pass across court after some risky play by djokovic . the serb responds well though , and takes the game with a forehand winner .
huge pair of aces from janowicz moves the pole to 40-15 and he gets on the board with a sublime drop shot that bounced sideways because of the spin imparted .
the world number six is finding his groove at the baseline , crashing home three forehand winners in a service hold to love . all about consolidating on serve and hanging tough now for tomic , but that is certainly easier said than done against the former finalist at sw19 .
ferrer quickly gets to 30-0 , before ripping an inside out forehand winner to go within a point of holding . he finishes with an ace to go ahead . can he do anything on almagro 's serve now ?
almagro looks like he 's starting to settle after a difficult first two service games . the spaniard forces a couple of wayward returns from nadal before wrapping up the game with a well-struck forehand down the line .
murray goes after the second serve and creates an opportunity to attack , but slams into the net .
djokovic applies pressure but wawrinka mixes things up to earn the first hold of the second set .
that 's now nine games on the trot for haase , and murray does n't seem to be interested in getting the trainer out at the change of ends . he 's slumped in his chair with a towel on his head .
djokovic holds one of the best games of the match so far . both players produced stunning winners and poor errors . biggest game of the night coming up ? i think so ...
but he double faults ! d'oh !
it 's a sublime start from murray , who executes a drop shot from the back of the court , but kyrgios powers back with a forehand winner , ace , and a huge first serve out wide . the australian double faults on game point before murray gets back to deuce with another drop shot . it 's kyrgios 's game though after he sends down a second ace and second forehand winner .
a difficult start to the game for federer 30-0 down before a series of powerful serves and stunning backhands brought him through . davydenko appears to have thrown caution to the wind , and is trying all sorts to attempt to catch federer out . nothing seems to be working for him though .
nishikori makes it 11 points in a row on serve to hold to love once more . he 's having a lot of joy with the serve-and-volley . makes you wonder why we are only seeing it in set three .
federer moves ahead in the set thanks to a love hold . the crowd traditionally love an underdog but they 're all on federer 's side here .
that 's that ! stan 's serve has been much better in this set and he 's 2-1 ahead . he takes a 40-0 lead , before his hard-hitting serve proves problematic for gasquet , and the swiss volleys home a winner after gasquet 's return to take control of the match now . is there any way back for the underdog ? of course , given that wawrinka - the third seed - has blown hot and cold throughout this match . unfortunately for gasquet , though , stan is growing better as the match goes on .
as the game goes in to its third hour , murray encounters the same problem as federer , he ca n't get federer 's serve back in play . there 's a bit a sense that both player might have eased off a little in the last couple of games as they realise they may be on court for quite some time yet .
the best rally of the match thus far arrives in the opening point as nadal again reaches a djokovic drop shot before whipping a backhand into the opposite corner . it becomes 0-30 as djokovic fails to reach a forehand onto the baseline , before the serbian nets to trail 0-40. the break does indeed arrive at the first time of asking as a challenge from nadal sees the ball drop long .
djokovic will want to get this done as soon as possible now , and two forehand winners down the line get him off to the perfect start in this service game . two mistakes from gasquet give him the love hold and he 's just three games away now .
still on serve as kubot keeps providing neat touch to deny janowic chances to unleash power from deep at the baseline . the world number 130 needs to maintain this high-energy approach in the match of his life and has made a confident start .
it 's such a tentative start from murray and he 's made to pay as ferrer races into a 0-30 advantage . that becomes 0-40 when murray nets a backhand and the love break is complete when murray ca n't handle a return after a weak second serve .
tsonga holds to 30 .
an ugly shot to start the game for berdych as nadal fires a forehand to his backhand side which skews off his racquet into the crowd . nadal begins to find his form in his strokes as he powers a forehand to the back of the court , which the czech ca n't return , while an ace soon follows from the spaniard . nadal secures the hold with relative ease with a simple serve and return to the opposite corner .
another ace from lopez gives him a 30-0 lead , but djokovic recovers . lopez moves to 40-15 ahead as djokovic hits the net from the baseline - just as the world number one was beginning to rediscover his rhythm from back there - before the spaniard held his serve to win the game .
despite taking the opening point , murray does n't look comfortable and concedes two double faults in a row . he responds by taking plenty off his first serve but it at least gets him into a few rallies and he 's able to hold to 30 .
what happened there ? wawrinka attempts to rip a backhand down the line but he completely misses the ball . a huge ace makes up for the error , but another glaring miss , this time from a volley , gives murray 15-30. that 's as good as it gets for murray , who floats a return wide after two big serves had given him game point .
federer starts brightly with an ace before coming into the net to win the next two points with volleys . federer tries to volley again to wrap up the game but a superb lob from lacko catches out the former champion , but he smashed his forehand long next time around to allow federer to consolidate his break .
it 's another hold from federer . both players seem to be in quite a hurry . the match has been underway for less than half an hour , and we 're already nine games in .
another confident hold from tomic as the 20-year-old sends an ace down the middle at 40-30. you can see the australian number one 's confidence growing throughout this second set , but can he translate that to a tangible success on the scoreboard ?
superb power and accuracy from stan gives him an early lead with a pummel down the line . he ca n't quite make the next return as the scores go level . gasquet pushes forward to earn a strong point in the corner and follows it up with a game-winning point as stand ca n't quite meet his return .
murray comfortably holds serve . his serve does n't look the weapon it was in the first three sets at the moment , but it 's still strong enough that federer has to work hard to make a return , with the swiss claiming just one point off the game .
murray is so unlucky with a forehand down the line after chasing down a smash , but that 's the small margins that could cost him a place in the final . djokovic extends his advantage to 30-0 before he crushes a forehand into the open court . too good . an easy smash confirms the game and he is two away .
murray must break here or else he is out . what can he do ? federer miss-hits a backhand into the net , before federer goes wide with a forehand . the swiss comes roaring back with a big serve down the middle , but murray has two break points after a fantastic return ! finally , but can he convert ? yes ! federer saves the first , but after federer floats a shot long , murray has the break !
after the opening two points are shared , wawrinka begins to unloads from the baseline and a startling cross-court backhand earns two game points . nishikori saves the first but a smash on the second seals the game for the swiss number two .
cilic does n't seem to downhearted about losing that second set as he holds comfortably .
simply too good from berdych . his return of murray 's serve had the scot back-peddling and the czech then returned to power a forehand winner down the line .
nadal races to a 40-15 lead as he looks to consolidate his break , but a double fault gives klizan some hope . however , a series of great shots from the net give nadal the game . he really seems to have woken up since going a set down .
composure and quality once more from the world number 135 , with darcis claiming a vital break with a forehand winner than sends nadal the wrong way . has nadal got enough left in the tank to respond ? you can never count out the eight-time french open winner , but he clearly looks to be bothered by his left knee when extending to reach the ball .
maybe not half an hour ... but close . sousa stops the rot with a solid service game and murray will have to hold now to wrap up the set .
of course , that 's a big if though . an ace down the middle and a wayward return from tsonga give federer 40-0 , and another easy hold is sealed when tsonga dumps a backhand return into the net .
tomic fires a super serve straight down the middle to take the opening point , but nadal outlasts him in the first lengthy rally of the match . tomic replies with two points in a row , including an ace , but he begins to flex his legs . that did n't look great . a passing shot keeps nadal in the game , but tomic sends down a second ace to win the first game . he looks to be struggling though ...
verdasco wraps up the game and consolidates his break with a nadal-esque whipped forehand to the corner .
however , the russian looks like he means business now and has raced into a 2-0 lead in the third set . mind you , he was 4-1 up in the previous one .
brilliant from federer as the world number four comes to the net to move 15-0 ahead with an overhead volley , before moving onto 30-0 when djokovic hits the net . federer 's 12th ace of the match brings 40-0 , but a running forehand from djokovic moves the serbian onto the board . federer holds , however , with a fine volley at the net .
berdych is doing a lot of running but it pays off on the first point as murray hits a weak backhand into the net , but the scot plays a couple of smart points to gain the lead . berdych gets back to 30-30 but a drive volley from murray brings up game point , which he takes with his sixth ace .
ferrer gets off to a good start with a forehand winner down the sideline , but has to wait to be awarded the point when bautista agut challenges . the hawkeye review fails to display on the on-court screen , meaning the umpire has to put in a phone call to find out whether the ball was good , much to the amusement of the crowd . despite the delay , ferrer keeps his cool to clinically wrap up the game , with bautista agut starting to look a little weary , having spent almost two hours on court .
monfils saves a pair of break points to claim a vital hold . he is clearly fired up with that one and acknowledges the crowd 's support as he races back to his chair .
djokovic nets in the first point for 15-0 , before federer then double-faults to leave the score level at 15-15. the swiss recovers to produce a powerful serve for 30-15 , however , before moving 40-15 ahead when djokovic nets . djokovic responds in the next point , however , with a wonderful return past his opponent . federer manages to secure the hold when djokovic fires a second serve into the net . nothing separating these two .
a quite exquisite backhand slice from federer draws a chorus of approval from the crowd , that was easily the best shot we 've seen so far today . benneteau has no answer to that kind of variety as the second seed holds to love with ease .
wow , ferrer breaks again comfortably and suddenly he 's a set up . nishikori started better , but ferrer stayed true to his game and took the first set .
strong start from federer as the swiss moves 15-0 ahead and then quickly onto 30-0 with another powerful serve . the next point brings 40-0 , but djokovic does get on the board when federer puts a forehand just wide . djokovic gains his second point of the game when federer fails to return a backhand , but the swiss manages to hold with a powerful serve .
a naff slice from murray at 40-15 but he ensures that he holds with a fifth ace of the match . amazing that janowicz has just one .
kyrgios returns well early on to force a mistake from nadal , but the spaniard responds with an ace before kyrgios hits his forehand into the net .
a piece of advice to you milos , stop coming to the net ! djokovic , again , fires a shot down at the big man 's feet and all he can do is limply put it into the net . raonic uses his height to put away an over-head impressively , but , again , he fluffs his lines at the net in what should have been a simple put-away . djokovic sends a shot long though to keep him in contention at 4-3 .
a horrible backhand from djokovic gives raonic hope at the beginning of the eighth game , but that is quickly extinguished by a driving volley from the serb . a bit of luck sends novak 40-15 up , and he regains a two-game lead when a flurry of brutal forehands forces raonic to find the net .
not bad from fognini there , who dinks a deft volley over the net to give himself the hold . not too much action at the net so far .
murray latches onto a second serve to take the early advantage before rola dumps a forehand over the baseline . the slovenian shows that he still has an interest in this match with making some coverage at the net for 30-30 , but he lets himself down with an unforced error into the net . murray misses out on the break point , but he takes the second chance after rola goes long .
a super one-two from murray gets him off to a good start , but he misses out after trying to take on a federer second serve . a stunning ace out wide takes the swiss into a 2-1 advantage , but murray steps in to smash his way to 2-2. federer has the mini-break when murray hits a backhand long , and that is immense from the swiss ! he claws several murray shots back over the net , forcing murray to wilt and put the ball long .
djokovic holds to 30 .
brands seems to have rediscovered his form as the third set has gone as he comfortably holds serve , but has he left it too late ? nadal will now serve for the set .
murray gets to a haase drop shot with seconds to spare but somehow just plops it into the net . he then goes long to give haase two break points . the dutchman goes long with the first and a swerving ace brings deuce . haase notches another three points before the scot finally takes the game on his first advantage following another great rally .
he 's been a model of consistency so far has djokovic and continues to pin benneteau back before eventually holding . he 's just biding his time here , looking for the opening , and you feel that it 'll come sooner rather than later .
a loud cry of vamos from nadal as he crashes a fifth ace down the line , keeping this second set on serve in the process .
nadal puts berdych on the back foot immediately as he pins up to the back of the court with an excellent couple of forehands to take a 30-0 lead . berdych works himself back into the game as he charges the net with a serve and volley to restore parity , while an error from nadal hands him a game point as he slices the ball into the net . the spaniard makes another mistake as he loses control of his attempted backhand slice , which falls out to hand the czech the game . he has a real chance to put the pressure on nadal here .
nadal quickly takes a 40-0 lead , but kyrgios keeps himself in the game with a cheeky shot between the legs . however , he fires his forehand into the net on the next point to keep the set on serve .
the perfect hold by murray , doing so to love . again he is just one game away from the final . can berdych keep up his recent revival and force a breaker ? we 're about to find out ...
what pressure ? he holds to love and now has just one more game required to take a famous win . he would be the first south african for a decade to get into the fourth round of a slam .
a poor volley sees tsonga fall 0-15 behind before djokovic comes out on top in two rallies to earn three break points . the first two are saved , but tsonga goes long on the third and the serbian has the opening break of the match .
tsonga moves further clear , but gasquet did push it to deuce . that 's something , at least . a hold is absolutely vital now , becuase if he can end up taking the set from this point then that could just knock the stuffing out of tsonga .
the two players share a superb opening exchange , which mayer wins , but murray replies with a forehand winner . a smash takes the german to 30-15 , but a net cord helps murray back to 30-30. murray has control of the next point but the umpire wrongly steps in and overrules a call . murray is n't impressed , but he wins the re-played point to earn a break point , but he frames a forehand high into the stands . the umpire correctly overrules on the deuce point , but wrongly penalises mayer . murray wastes another break point and the german comes through what was a crazy first game .
the third set starts in similar fashion to how the second ended . djokovic breaks dimitrov to love to take an early lead in the third and at this rate final set .
and another careless forehand gifts gasquet the break . i told you he had to have a dip somewhere , but i did n't expect it to be quite this dramatic . he 's all over the place at the moment .
youzhny gets lucky with a net cord early on in the game but it does n't affect murray who holds to 15 with his seventh ace of the match .
murray is having a few issues with his back . i will keep you posted . his first serve finds the mark , but a double fault cancels it out . you get the feeling that mayer senses murray is n't at 100 % , but an unforced error and coming into the net at the wrong time contribute to him falling 40-15 down . the reigning us open champion slips up with a drop-shot , but a forehand error from mayer concedes the game .
but , murray holds again to enforce the double break . five games in a row and this set will be wrapped up inside half an hour .
tsonga 's face is not a happy one at the moment as gulbis holds to love . will the frenchman be able to ride out this pain or will he become yet another retiree ?
after being drawn at 15-15 , federer serves wonderfully to set up a rush and leave novak stranded for 30-15. an ace at 115mph leaves things at 40-15 and federer finishes the game off with more great work at the net .
he 's winning this at a canter now . not even that ; a trot . a dodgy let call stops him winning the game with an ace out wide , so he goes down the t and that one stands .
mayer eases into a 30-0 lead , but murray shows no sign of giving the game away , firing a backhand down the line that mayer can only send wide . the world number 47 then goes long , and murray has break point . mayer saves it though , and manages to grind himself to a vital service hold .
murray restarts the match with a first serve that is sent into the net by his opponent , but the scores are level when pospisil catches the line with a forehand . murray opens up a 40-15 advantage before pospisil concedes the game when sending a return long .
djokovic has to work to consolidate the break , but he manages to keep his serve intact . muller hits some solid forehand to get the game to 30-30 , but a slices backhand from the top seed followed by a long backhand return from the world number 42 allow djokovic to escape .
again after just a touch of resistance djokovic takes his service game . murray has n't had a break point yet , but has saved a handful .
isner has taken control again and is now within two points of the second round .
federer really is flying now . davydenko is struggling to return to federer serve , and will find it difficult to get the break back unless he can move in to another gear .
that was an incredible turnaround from evans , but he has to maintain this momentum because nishikori will come out firing in this second set . the number 11 seed keeps evans on the back foot to move 15-30 ahead , and he earns two break point with a sliced put-away at the net . that 's a tame start from the brit , and he nets to concede the break .

federer has yet to create a break point on the nadal serve , and that continues in this game . it 's no surprise when nadal is hitting backhand winners at will , and his ninth comes in this game . federer has n't hit a single one . a love hold is sealed with an ace .

berdych uses his first challenge of the match to question a call at the baseline , with the czech player proved right to close out a hold he scarcely deserved . klizan is simply unable to step inside and catch a first serve with any conviction , allowing berdych to earn cheap points and maintain his hold on the match .

excellent tennis from the frenchman again . he 's 40-15 up , as usual , before cleverly deceiving wawrinka by hitting it in the opposite direction from which he was travelling . fine shot and he 's two games away from victory ! he needs a break to win it in regulation though .
we have a first-set tie-break after a comfortable hold for raonic . some mega serves put this game to bed quickly , while djokovic must rue that chance two games ago now .
wawrinka was certainly in that game , but djokovic was never really in any trouble so the balls are back with the swiss .
there it is . it was important to hold , but instead he 's been broken to love . he 's had no change from the djokovic serve so far and if that continues he 'll be two sets down .
an ace for ferrer to finish and he holds to love . excellent start with the ball from both men .
this one could be over very soon in fact . cilic hustles at the baseline and finally gets the decisive break .

verdasco hits out and that 's the scot 's first snap of verdasco 's serve in the match . just what the centre court crowd needed .
anyone for a new york bagel ? i fancy that one could be on the menu in set three . nadal is really firing now and , in truth , harrison looks like he is feeling a bit sorry for himself .
klizan dives in for an attempt at a volley , but he does n't get to the net in time . nadal 's increased tempo catches the slovakian out as he fires his next two forehands well long , giving nadal three break points . he takes the game with the next point , as klizan fails to find the baseline with his forehand yet again .
nieminen strikes back . he 's looked weary in the opening few games of this set , so wo n't be keen to let haas force a fifth . some superb returning has haas on the back foot , and he 's powerless to stop the finn .
robredo comes through in strange circumstances . he guessed right from murray 's short forehand and smacked one straight at the scot , who decided to let it go but the ball fell inside the baseline .
this is a really good start with the ball from tsonga . federer just has no answer to the frenchman 's power and tsonga follows up his first love service game with another . he 's comfortably on top so far but , as we all know , he will dip .
