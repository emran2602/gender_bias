what are the main positives you can draw from today 's final ?
what 's next ahead of wimbledon in terms of what you would like to work on ?
grass is a tricky surface and you need to move and you need to sort of get down low to the balls . do you find that 's kind of a struggle at times ?
if i 'm not mistaken , you had n't won backtoback matches on grass before you came here . that 's got to give you some confidence going to eastbourne .
what made it click this year for your grass game ?
on the brink of the top 10 in the world now , is that your main target going into eastbourne ?
congratulations on the victory today . what did you feel was the best part of your game today that helped you win a grass final ?
in that first set , you obviously lost it . how did you regain your composure for the second and third sets ?
how important was your coach today ?
will your training schedule become more intense as it gets closer to wimbledon , or will it be similar ?
how does it feel now to have titles on every surface ?
it 's a quick turnaround for you now . you 're still on the list for eastbourne . what are your expectations now ? final in eastbourne in 2012 , so you 're going to have a lot of expectation on you .
you must have been very happy to get that out of the way nice and quickly today .
how hard was it to sort of settle ? there had obviously been an a lot of rain disruption . how did that affect you ?
you seem to have her number . she 's a great grasscourt player , but she 's not managed to beat you in five matches . what are some of the reasons for that , do you think ?
you seemed to have had an unusual year . there was a long spell between january and march without a win , then two titles in a row , i think . you seem to be playing well again now . what are the reasons for the ups and downs ?
and as your career has gone on , you seem to have improved on grass . you 've had good results in three tournaments now on grass . do you feel that you 're as good on this surface now as on the other surfaces ?
you mentioned on court after the match that sabine has a tricky serve to play against on grass . how will you approach pliskova 's serve in the final tomorrow ?
and what will you do to prepare for the final now ?
having won here in 2011 , do you think that gives you a little advantage psychologically in the later stages of a tournament like this ?
you 've reached the semifinal and the final in wimbledon in the past five years . do you feel doing well in tournaments like the aegon classic is important to form in a grand slam ?
your record with kerber is n't the best . do you feel like you 're in the right place mentally and physically to overcome her as an opponent ?
grass is your best surface ; however , is it your favor one ?
and your serve has been outstanding thus far in the tournament . do you feel that 's your best outlet to win this tournament and go on to wimbledon as well ?
what 's it going to be like to go up against a fed cup teammate ? does that affect how you approach the match at all ?
in terms of your general fitness , you 've had a few injuries .
exactly . i was going to say , right now you 're in real good form .
are you confident that you can turn around this awful record ?
this has nothing to do with anything today , but i 'm doing a survey . if you 're at a tournament and they played like walkon music and they said , is there a song you want us to play when you enter the court , is there one specific song that you would say , this is what i want ?
what 's the song of the moment then ?
one more question : fed cup , while i 'm thinking about it , some people were asking some atp guys earlier in the year if they thought maybe having it every year was not a good thing . maybe every other year . any thoughts on that ?
even allowing for the difficulties you had ? because two years in a row in stuttgart it 's been a very quick turnaround for you , for the german team in particular , because you 're going so deep . no thoughts on that ?
how do you feel about the match ?
what was the support like from the crowd out there ?
looking forward to the semifinal ?
feeling fit ? no niggles ?
do you believe you can go on and win this now that you 've got this far ?
well done . are you pleased with the way you 're playing ?
it was an unusual first set , was n't it ? you had a lead and then you almost lost it . three set points against you . why was it up and down like that ?
did you feel that in the second set you may not be completely in control , but you were definitely on top ?
looked as if when you played your game and played it the way you wanted to that you would win . do you feel that 's the case when you play almost anybody on this surface ?
this is just a generic question i 'm asking some of the players : if you were at tournament and they had like walkon music for the court and they said , okay , you pick a song ; we 're going to play it when you come on court . is there one particular song that you might say , this is what i want ?
it 's been a good run for you in nottingham and here ; obviously disappointing to go out today . a word about how you felt that you prepared coming out today , this morning ?
couple of words about how you felt to have to come out again this morning and try at such a stage in the match ?
heading now to eastbourne ?
you 're going down now ?
i think that 's three top 100 players you 've beaten in the last seven days or so . how much confidence does that give you ?
how great is it for you that you 've now got nottingham , birmingham , and eastbourne before wimbledon ?
have you set yourself goals for this year ?
you can share them .
you have n't got a ranking in mind ?
start with your doubles today . great win in the doubles , but was n't looking like that to begin with .
and today 's match was a good start for you . you must feel very comfortable with having a fairly good win today .
yeah .
obviously i saw you at times over the clay court season , and it was n't as good a clay court season as maybe you would 've hoped . what are you doing to put that behind you and focus on the grass and then on to the hard courts ?
how long before you picked up a tennis racquet then ?
a good long break then before you came back here .
and looking forward to your next match ?
having won in birmingham in 2007 , do you believe past winning experience in a tournament is helpful years later in doing well ?
do you think this is the toughest aegon classic there has been in years ?
we had a good chat with you yesterday and you explained the background now . is this now for you business as usual , taking the games , you know , next up kerber or ...
well , yeah . you know , first round , second round , this is the plan .
are you surprised ana has gone out ?
you 've come straight from the clay to the grass , and she 's been playing on grass . was that the principle difference in this match ?
you seem to have either worked your way out of trouble or be working your way out of trouble . was there any change in your mindset having done that , do you think ?
do you feel that you did some good things but that she played very well ?
how will you now prepare for wimbledon ?
will you stay in england now until wimbledon ?
will you have a lot of spare time or will you be training a lot then ?
which aspects of your game are you going to look to improve ?
you said you were working on a lot of things . is wimbledon too early to get the benefit of that ?
i know you have to take one match at a time , but you reached the semifinals at the last grand slam . is that too ambitious a target for wimbledon ?
and football fans like myself were pleased to see schweinsteiger there . does that help you or distract you ? it can be both , ca n't it ?
overall impressions of the match ? how do you think you played , and your opponent ?
when you say you do n't know , you ca n't elaborate on that ? you do n't know yourself ?
obviously 2015 , the form , how would you describe your mood at the moment ? are you anxious ? are you upset ? are you angry with yourself ? what adjective would you use about yourself a the moment ?
can you see it changing in the next week or two ? anything you can do to make it change ?
are you going to go to eastbourne ?
what are you and sam going to try and work on in the short term now , because it 's only a very quick turnaround .
how did you find the rain delay , and how difficult was it to play an opponent who has had a grass court tournament already ?
it can be a variable surface . if you have doubts about your form already , must be more difficult to come onto a grass court and play at your best ; would that be true ?
you did so well at wimbledon last year . can you take a lift from that , do you think ?
you said you were frustrated , but i thought you kept your cool quite well out there . did n't lose it mentally . is that difficult to do when you are frustrated , to just keep together ?
so it 's worked then ?
sorry about the result . do you think the elbow injury that you withdrew with last week was a contributory factor today ?
will you go to eastbourne ? obviously you need to put in a good show before wimbledon .
does this put you under more pressure for eastbourne ? how does it affect your wimbledon preparations ?
were you still feeling the elbow today ? you said it was not a massive contributing factor , but was it still sore when you were playing ?
you said you did n't feel relaxed out there . any reason for that ? have you tried to analyze why that was ?
do you notice when you 're out there you kind of get a feeling very early on that that 's the case and things are n't quite clicking ?
you 're confident the elbow will be fully fixed , healed by the time wimbledon comes around ?
you sometimes learn more from losing than winning . i know you 've just come off and you said too many unforced errors , but was there anything else you could put your finger on ?
obviously you were hoping for a run here . how do you plan your week now ?
how do you feel now ?
did you feel you came out a bit better prepared ?
( indiscernible . )
and it 's good preparation for wimbledon being here ?
how did you feel broady played against you as a brit ?
you said there is no pressure on you . just briefly looking ahead to wimbledon , it was a big breakthrough for you last year . do you think people will be looking for you to progress and challenge there this year ?
was it then quite good being at the french open , perversely what happened , because it gave you the opportunity to work out how to deal with something like that , the pressure and perhaps the disappointment ?
although you may not have played a lot of grass court tennis in your career , do you feel your natural game translates really very well to this surface ?
the timing of that first break of serve at 54 was pretty good as well , was n't it ? it was just the right moment to break .
how do you feel about the much longer break between the clay court grand slam and the grass court grand slam ? is that a really good thing ? what are your thoughts about that ?
will you play another week on grass ?
you 're in the doubles with heather tomorrow .
and you have n't played together before ?
what do you think of heather as a player ?
do you feel sympathy for her a little bit when there is so much spotlight and everybody is looking at the british players here now and eastbourne and then wimbledon ? do you feel sorry for her because everybody is expecting big things ?
did you learn anything from the match playing someone like that ?
taking the tournament as whole , have you exceeded your expectations this week ?
one more from me . my photographer said he got a nice shot of a b on the back of your ... is that a recent thing ?
and that 's it ? you 're not going to have any more ?
what can you learn from being out there today , aside from perhaps a disappointing second set where it got away from you a little bit ?
can you take more away from games like this ? i am sure you 're not studying them when you 're on court , but when you watch it back at all can you take pointers of what they 've done against you to then help you improve ?
that the plan for the rest of week then ?
why would it depend on the wildcards whether you go to eastbourne ?
if you get a wildcard you will play eastbourne ?
well done .
you played some very good tennis , but it was a strange first set , was n't it ? very nearly went 5love down and pulled it back . talk about the ups and downs of that match .
you stopped a rally and made a video review challenge at ...
you stopped the rally and made video review challenge which did n't work at 4love .
as it happened , that set turned around after that . i do n't know if you remember it .
you started to serve very well , did n't you ?
you 've played as many matches , tournaments , this year now as the whole of last year , 2014. is that helping you ?
do you feel in a better place now than at the start of the year ?
do you like the grass ?
just going back to the first set when you 've obviously fallen down , a bit flat as you say , not concentrating , what was it , do you think , that turned match and changed it into your favor ? what did you do to get back into it ?
on your injuries , are you completely injuryfree now ?
do you feel all things are still possible now ?
congratulations . how does that rank in some of your victories against a player ranked so much higher ?
how do you feel about your play ? seemed really confident .
did you feel nervous towards the end ? did n't look it .
tell us a bit about surbiton last week . was that a conscious choice to have plenty of time ahead of coming here ?
what do you make of your next opponent , simona halep . quite daunting .
how did you find the court ? how much did you enjoy it ? you said in your interview on the court how you 've always enjoyed playing here .
will a victory tomorrow be the biggest in your career ?
the wimbledon wildcards have n't come out yet , have they ?
on your way up to london , will you be able to look back on nottingham and here and feel you got some really good preparation behind you for wimbledon ?
it got away so quickly in the final set . can you talk us through what was happening for you .
you took a lot of chances certainly in the second set with your dropshots and your slices with the wind switching direction . i think in the final set , like you say , just very small margins , but it was enough to tip it her way very quickly .
the scoreline to somebody who had n't seen the match , they might think it was a thrashing . but it was a close match . are you happy with how you played today ?
do you think that was because you were more tired because you played a lot more than her in your last match ? two hours and she only had 13 minutes .
the chances are you 're going to play on tuesday . does that make you feel a little better that you have a bit of time now to adjust to the grass when you get back to wimbledon ?
has what you have achieved sunk in yet ?
what did your mom say ?
can you just describe how you felt in that final set ? walk us through your final set .
how important has martina hingis been to you in your career ?
she was a teenager when she won wimbledon , '97 . you 're going in on the back of two grass court finals . are you looking towards wimbledon to win it this year ?
do you really not have grass courts in switzerland ?
do you play tennis with the cows ?
besides martina hingis , is there any other player you look at for inspiration ? any other older player ?
going back to the grass , i 'm not positive , but you have probably more matches on grass than any other lady this month .
do n't quote me on , but probably it 's correct .
so i guess the downside would be are you tired ? do you have some tape on ? nope ?
i guess the upside to that would be between holland and birmingham and here , i 'm sure you have played more grass tournaments than anybody else .
looking ahead to pironkova , she 's known for coming out of the grass court season performing really well and maybe not performing so well on the other surfaces . so firstly , how are you feeling about facing her ? secondly , how confident are you now taking that form through for the rest of the season ?
the other final , you lost to camila giorgi . what do you think about her ?
back in charleston you indicated that you preferred to play matches versus practicing . so is this your new strategy as to how to avoid practice ?
what happened ?
was this precaution you 're taking rather than something that 's actually going to threaten you being at wimbledon this week ?
was it something you felt right from the start ?
are you feeling pain just in your back low back , is it ?
you were stretching out your hamstring ...
is it particularly when you 're serving or ...
you were n't tempted to fire down bombs and hope she could n't get them back ?
is there anything in the next couple of days that would stop you being there on monday or tuesday ?
is it something you 'd have to nurse through , nurse yourself through next week ?
what gave you more trouble , sloane or the seagull ?
is that the weirdest thing that 's ever happened to you on a tennis court ?
have you ever been attacked by a bird before ?
you took some risks , though . it was very windy . looked like it was coming across the court . when you were sort of slicing with those dropshots , did you think they were going to come back at you ?
you know you will be facing belinda in the final and you have never faced her before . what are your thoughts on that ?
will it be difficult maybe to play a teenager who might have no fear at all in a final ?
do you feel like you 're playing at the level you were at when you got to the final of wimbledon three years ago ?
that 's probably not the way that you wanted to reach the final . were you aware of any issues with wozniacki early on ?
i mean , you were strapping and your oncourt interview , you were fine , but ...
when you had your fall yesterday , do you think it was a bad injury or ...
probably more the shock of a fall ?
is it causing you pain when you 're moving and twisting , the injury ?
yeah .
when you 're moving .
when you came into the week , you must have had some targets in your head . i do n't suppose they included the final ?
how do you feel about facing agnieszka ? she 's a former champion here . she 's playing really well .
you say you watched tv . do you find it hard to play players you have watched growing up and coming through the juniors ?
you mentioned hingis has been helping you recently . she was obviously a great grass court player . what sort of tips and advice has she given you this week ?
she was watching you yesterday . does that give you any extra motivation when you have someone of her caliber watching you ?
what are your thoughts ahead to wimbledon ? what are your thoughts on the draw ?
you seem to be taking quite well to the grass , though . is it a surface that suits your game ?
swiss players seem to like grass a lot . what is it about that ?
that was a convincing performance from you today .
how does playing at eastbourne compare to some of the other events on tour ?
how do you feel your form is ? you won it in 2009. how much better do you feel you are coming into this year ?
what do you think of liverpool 's signing ? they 've signed quite a few more players .
do you feel you 're one of the favorites as winning the tournament now ?
does it necessarily matter either way going into wimbledon whether you win or not ? does that have some meaning ?
i read that your target for wimbledon is the quarterfinals .
do you hope to go further than that ?
as you said , 2009 is a long time ago . what do you do better now ? is there a couple of things that you really think are just a huge improvement in your game ?
there have been quite a lot of injuries from other players this week , but you seem to be in pretty good shape . is that something that could help you the next fortnight , your physical condition ?
was the heat hard today ?
having not gone past the fourth round at wimbledon before , does that become a mental test as much as it is a physical one ? is that sort of playing in the back of your mind when you 're out there ?
your assessment of that ?
first set , you certainly got up to some momentum ? some momentum in the first set ?
do you feel the second set was more of a case of her finding better form ?
tell me about that . you had a medical timeout , did n't you , at the start of the third ?
so what was the problem ?
you say you were ill all week ? you have hidden that well . when did it start ? when did you start feeling ...
how was it affecting you at that stage of the match when you asked for the medical timeout ? how were you feeling ?
the week began for you in front of the almost proverbial one man on his dog on a cold sunday evening . it 's ended with a narrow quarterfinal defeat in front of a full audience . how do you reflect on that overall ?
did the result also emphasize how much she 's improved from a year ago when you beat her in the first round here ? she 's come a long way since then ?
what inspiration will you take from this week ? will you look at videos during the rest of the season , high spots of this week ?
you have beaten a top 10 and a top 20. is that something you look back on and say , i did this ?
do memories like playing in front of a packed centre court , does that get you through the other tournaments you have been playing recently or this year , more than one man and a dog but not many more ?
a couple of the ball boys and ball girls were practicing the konta ball bounce . how cool is that that people copy what you do on court ?
it must be cool people are watching you and using you as a role model ?
has there been more of a buzz around eastbourne this week ?
but generally after eastbourne when you play here , obviously you have been on the bbc and everything , do people notice you more when you 're around ?
you 're probably quite happy with that ?
expectations ? wimbledon next week . with laura obviously not there , the responsibility lies with you to ...
obviously you started this week , people sort of see you as an underdog , whereas next week , rightly or wrongly , people will be expecting a little bit more from you . what do you sort of prefer ? to have the underdog mentality or feel more pressure ?
belinda got quite animated a couple of times on the court . does that put you off at all or do you completely disregard that ?
( question about jo 's anger . )
you seem quite level headed . is that always the case , then ?
you have got a momentum now going into wimbledon , which must make you greatly confident .
how easy is it to avoid getting fazed by losing a 51 lead ?
did you lose concentration or what ? was there a sort of reason for it ?
i was talking to petkovic and she said the key to grass court is getting that first strike in . would you agree with that , or do you think the defensive game can still work ?
when we watch men 's matches on hard and clay and then watch them on grass , there is a big difference . they use a lot more slice , big servers come to the fore more . in women 's tennis ...
is it particularly different playing on grass versus the other surfaces ?
a lot of the other top seeds have left us this week . why do you think it 's been so hard this tournament so far ?
the rankings , sometimes they can be a little bit deceptive ?
do you enjoy the extra three weeks , having the extra week , three weeks between ?
any pressure of ranking points ?
you must be feeling a bit disappointed after that .
did you feel a bit flat before the match at all ?
at the beginning of the week you said it was all about getting some time on the grass . i appreciate it 's a little too soon to ask , but how happy overall are you with the run you had here ?
what goes through your mind when , after about 10 or 15 minutes , suddenly you find yourself 3 or 4love down and it seems like everything is going against you ?
are you now a little bit excited ?
what went through your mind when you dropped serve when you were serving for the match ?
how did this performance compare to your other two this week ?
can you tell us what 's been the difference in the last couple of weeks to your form ? what 's made a difference for you ? anything off the court or anything you 're doing on the court ?
did you feel anything click though at any stage this week , a couple weeks ago , that actually lifted you to a point where you can win matches like this ?
people talk about staying healthy , and for them that 's often the turning point where they get stronger in the right places to be able to have the ability to play . has anything changed since new haven that 's helped with that ?
what was your thinking behind the coaching changes ?
do you feel in the past you put too much stress or pressure on yourself ?
is this a breakthrough then for you ? is this week particularly a breakthrough ? what would your family or your boyfriend say if we asked you how your highly strung nature manifests itself at home ? what do you do ?
you have a momentum , do n't you , this week ?
does it give you any confidence to know you beat bencic last year on grass ? you often say it 's a completely different year .
but really , you know , you have beaten her and you know you have a lot of experience behind you .
do you think you are producing the best , the best you have ever done , this week ?
great time for it , going into wimbledon with a lot of confidence ?
you are the first british woman to win three matches in the main draw here since 1983 .
when you won earlier , somebody working here said it was the biggest cheer they 'd heard from the crowd .
heather was pretty choked yesterday when she won and with the crowd behind her and it lifted her . just watching your face now , do you feel that emotion when you are trying to serve it out ?
it 's great you talk about the whole season , but we get fixated on this time of year , of course . a lot of players talk about the matches they may play in a godforsaken place with four men and a dog as a sort of buildup to something like this . but you seem to be putting it at almost the same level .
but is this then not the kind of thing you spend all those weeks for ? is this not the reward for all that ?
going back to saying you 're highly strung ...
you 're very different on court . has that always been the case ? when you were younger , would they say you 're always right at home ?
did you used to argue with umpires when you were younger ? have you changed in that sense ?
can you remember the angriest you have been on court ?
you said you have been working with your team a lot on that , so is there any particular methods or to make sure you keep that attitude on court ?
what happened with the new coaching team you have had for more or less a year ? so with the previous situation , did that just reach a natural conclusion ? what was the reason for that change ?
was that your personal reasons or the coach 's ?
have you tried transcendental meditation ?
supposed to work .
no . i 'm always agitated . ( laughter . )
how serious is the injury ?
what stage did it start ? the first set was pretty competitive .
did you feel it yesterday at all ?
any fears for wimbledon at the moment ?
do you feel the fates have been against you ?
will you have more treatments today ?
( indiscernible . )
what are your memories of last year ? obviously wimbledon was a massive highlight .
have you looked at it as an opportunity to revitalize your form , given how well you did last year ?
obviously it 's a bit soon to put it into context now , but yesterday 's performance , does that give you a lot of confidence that you are beginning to find a way through with all these tweaks you are doing to your game ?
what was the doctor 's diagnosis ?
abdominal problem ?
is that the sort of thing you can , even if you 've got a bit of discomfort , you can strap it up and play ?
anything that would stop you playing next week ?
you could have aggravated it this week and missedwimbledon altogether ?
everyone prefers winning to losing , but when you have had a run of bad results for the first time in many years , does it ever take away some of the fun of just hitting the ball ?
you talked a lot about feeling lost on court . have you been able to put your finger on why you feel you 're not you ?
have you had sports psychology to help that side and make you get better with your frame of mind ?
how do you block out these thoughts now , your thinking on court ?
do you find that you get quite easily distracted ?
has the last 18 months taught you about the value of momentum ?
do you feel your opponents are raising their game even more now when they are playing you now because you are a big name and etcetera ?
you 're going to get that a lot next week with press . they will ask the same question , how are you going to match last year . how are you going to deal with that constant speculation where actually you just want to be left alone to play ?
reach the final again ?
what 's the shake of the day ?
what 's your favorite ?
emotional finish for you . what was it about that final sort of set that brought on those emotions ?
players can sometimes get overcome by emotions . do you think that 's actually helping you at the moment ?
do you remember having that kind of reaction at the end of a match before ?
it was a big win . sloane next . this is your surface , really . so do you feel you have an advantage on grass now ?
does it make it even better that you came from behind to win ?
is that something to look at maybe making a fast start tomorrow ?
when you were playing in paris , your elbow , you looked very inhibited when you were serving . you were serving very well today . how much confidence do you take now that the elbow is rightfully back ?
did you manage to watch any of jo konta 's match earlier ?
it was a good day for british tennis allaround , really .
for the females . women . yes .
muguruza .
do you remember what it was like when you had your first top10 win ?
i know you treat every match the same , but you have just beaten a top10 player in the world . that 's got to feel different , surely .
you do appreciate it 's pretty rare for a british player to beat top 10s . does n't happen every day .
but it 's true . it 's a massive deal .
do you feel in a good place right now , playing some of your best tennis ?
did you find yourself getting more nervous or more calm as you got closer to winning ?
how much more special is it to do it in front of a home crowd and in your hometown ?
what pleases you most ? is it the win or the manner in which you achieved it ?
you do n't know who you 're going to play next , but how far do you think you can go now ?
your progression from nottingham to birmingham to here , you 're right , it 's not just about doing well in these three weeks plus wimbledon on grass , it 's how you 're going to translate into the rest of the season . you have the hard court swing but a good run here and good run at wimbledon is going to bounce you up the rankings . how are you going to sort of adjust your mindset now after this kind of profile win ?
i know you said you take each point as it comes , but are you looking forward to wimbledon or are you just totally sort of ignoring it ?
i seem to recall when we first spoke , must be a couple of years now down here , the goal , you were talking about breaking into the top 100. you did that .
i think so .
postwimbledon last year you got to 89. so going forward from here , what are you kind of looking at ?
how are you feeling ? because you have had a bit of the flu .
how long were you sick ?
a little bit of a resurrection helped then ?
obviously coming back on , it 's going to debilitate you and make you feel lethargic . is that how you felt out there today ?
are you going to stay down here and practice or head to london and actually practice in situ ?
did you feel tentative before the match because of lack of practice on the grass ?
do you feel a bit frustrated you were the defending champion and you had the illness so you 're probably not at your best to defend the title there ?
is it extra disappointing because you had an extra week of grass this year ? did it seem like you were going to have more time on grass ?
do you feel that affects your preparations for next week , then , the lack of match time you have had going into wimbledon ?
slightly happier person than when i saw you in birmingham . talk about how you feel with this win under your belt .
do you feel now something is beginning to click with the grass court season ?
how tough has it been the past few months ? you said you learned quite a lot about yourself and about life . how tough has it been in that sense ?
do you have some happy memories from here , wimbledon last year , or is it because people expect things from you it 's a little bit of a hindrance ?
have you looked at any of the videos ? would you do that from last year ? just to remember , remind yourself how well you played ?
your forehand , it 's a thing of great beauty and power when it works and sometimes it 's a thing of weakness . today did you try and control it a little bit more ? do you say to yourself , just hit it , keep hitting it ?
why do you think that happened that you went away from your natural game ?
you had a great 52 point , i think it was . you had to defend and you won it . is that the sort of point that can turn things around towards the end of the match when you served out ? those are the points where you started really playing or feeling as well as you did ?
do you feel a sense of relief now ? are you looking forward to the next game slightly more ?
would it be too simple to say you took success for granted ?
you come through it stronger ?
is that something you learned on your own or have you been getting advice from other people ?
what is in that glass ?
does it honestly taste better than it looks ?
is n't that kind of taking a risk , not knowing what 's in it ?
you changed your coach . was that part of the consistency factor ?
yeah .
looked like you were playing a much more patient day today , not necessarily as aggressive as you were trying to be in birmingham . is that the plan ?
are you happy that diego is back with you this week ?
how difficult were the conditions ? windy and the sun was a problem , was n't it ?
this is grass . wimbledon is obviously grass . but is this a good guide to form for wimbledon with the conditions being so different ?
how important is it for your confidence to get that grass court win under your belt ?
is the elbow completely right now ? everything okay ?
talk a little bit about your doubles in birmingham . you were almost down and out with simona . you came back . what was it like to play with her ? did that help getting that win even though you did n't go on any further ?
your opponent today was making some very distinct sounds . did that put you off at all ?
it was quite high pitched and long .
you were just focused ?
is there ever a reluctance to play this week , given the fact there is wimbledon next week ? we talked to andy earlier and the guys and they would n't dream of playing the week before .
that must be disappointing , but two tiebreak sets . obviously very close .
does this increase your hopes going into melbourne ?
you 've played a lot of tennis recently . how are you feeling physically ?
are you relieved that you do n't have to play the doubles final now ?
you forced petra to play a second match point by playing an outstanding volley to save it .
what are some of the things you like to do to your game to improve it ?
you said you do n't feel really comfortable at the net , but you play a lot of doubles and you seem quite good at this net . do you feel like you should be trying to do that more ?
you went to melbourne last year ranked in the 60s and now you 're top 25. where are the biggest improvements in your game in the last 12 months ?
i know you played lots of finals before , but i think this might have been the biggest one , biggest crowd , kind of biggest stadium , big opponent ?
most players have problems with the lefties , but you beat kerber last night and you matched quite the same level with petra . is it because you play with your sister ?
out of all the players on the women 's tour , who is one that you admire and look up to ? like , if i had that kind of career i would be really happy .
you mentioned guys . what are some of the guys ?
there was expectation on you heading to melbourne anyway , but now really winning sydney , how does it all fit with you ?
( question regarding the australian open draw . )
talk about the tiebreaks , which were very close . at the end you decided to be aggressive and that 's how you grabbed it , huh ?
she looked a little afraid at the end , but you did n't look afraid . did you feel scared at the end ?
no . she looked a little afraid , but you looked fine .
did you feel scared at all because you knew it was close ?
have you ever lost a tiebreak from 51 up , a match from 51 up in the tiebreak ?
so what did you tell yourself at that point to get yourself back moving the right direction ?
karolina said she was a bit tired in the final . did you feel it at all when you played her ?
so 15 titles , and 15 times you won the first set . should people start to be scared when you win the first set ?
so in australia three years ago against maria sharapova , 64 in the third . that was a very good one . last two years have been not where you usually are . talk about that a little bit .
you feel your more mature now ?
now you 're 24 .
lots of people like to take the week off before a grand slam , but you always come to sydney . or you have for the last few years . how important are the matches leading up in the week , and how important is this title to you going forward ?
you talked about having to forget about the sydney trophy and focus on australia . is it almost more beneficial to remember the sydney trophy for confidence ?
your game is obviously suited very well to grass .
fashion question : a lot of the people this year have been wearing the same kind of minty color . do you get to choose the colors or does nike choose them ?
even though pironkova is a lowerranked player , did you feel it was quite an achievement to beat here in the semifinal after she 's won so many matches here in the past couple of years ?
one step further then you got last year at this tournament . you feel like you 're a step ahead in the way you 're playing than you were at this time last year ?
i know you still have one match to go here , but do you feel like your game is ready now to play a grand slam ?
are you the kind of player that likes to get many matches under your belt in terms of these leadups ? some players , particularly some of the men , only like to play the odd match here and there before a big tournament . you have five . does that work well for you ?
karolina has been in such impressive form the last few games . what are you expecting tomorrow night ?
she kind of plays very similarly to you with the big serve and the power , very flat . when you come up against someone so similar to you , what is going to be the difference ? how will you separate yourself ?
well , yes . there is that .
is the next step for you in your career to reproduce the success you had at wimbledon at one of the other grand slams ?
so from winning wimbledon the two times you have , have you identified anything that 's the key to you being successful at a grand slam tournament ?
you talked about the match against sharapova in 2012 australian open . maybe one that got away or one of your most disappointing losses ?
does that make you more motivated to succeed at the australian open ?
your country is so strong in tennis , both men 's and women 's , with a relatively small population . why has that been in the last few years ?
you think it goes back to the lendls and the navratilovas and the kids getting into it ?
the wta is going back to prague this year . are you attending ?
there is a new rule ...
you look remarkably fresh when you played three matches more than everyone else . recovery must be good .
how excited are you to be in the semifinals again ?
were you surprised that maybe you would get your wildcard before coming in here ?
has the experience of last year helped you ?
what makes sydney feel like home for you ?
did you sense your opponent was tired a little bit tonight ?
eight wins again to win the whole thing .
are you watching tonight 's match ? going to recover and watch from the hotel ? you could be playing kvitova again .
when you got here this week were you thinking , you know what ? the same thing is going to happen . be you confident immediately when i get on the court .
what are your goals for this year ? can you tell us a little bit about what you hope to achieve by the end of 2015 ?
not getting a wildcard here , has that spurred you on ?
not receiving a wildcard this year , has that made you more determined to win here again ?
you had practiced with her before . what did you make of her game tonight ?
i was going to say , coming back from a set down is always pleasing when you can wrap those up .
so , very windy .
so overall since last week do you feel like you 're hitting okay ? you 're feeling well ?
but you 're not sick ?
ground hog day . you had semifinal last year against pironkova and you got her again this year .
have you been able to watch her ? she 's higher ranked than she was last year .
so the offseason went pretty well , i would assume .
so you feel like you 're running faster ?
very fast ?
you tell me .
so you 're saying aggressive . you 've always been aggressive . you mean you want that right at the start when you 're hitting the ball as fast as you can as hard as you can ?
of course you played a lot of matches in your career . today you were comfortably leading in the first set , and then she started hitting winner after winner . all the crowd was behind her and she was one point away from breaking you and serving for the match . what did you think at that point ?
yeah .
and you made quite a big scream after that .
what do you think about pliskova . seems to be getting better all the time .
you played her once , right ?
so might see her in a couple days , huh ?
so you have n't decided on fed cup , canada ?
yes . but are you going to play or you have n't decided ?
seems like the later you play the better it goes ?
so what was that like last night ? got there i think 12:30 something like that , played three hours , but kept going . what did it feel like ?
so tonight i think it was just after 10:00 you lost 60 in the first . so what ?
pliskova said that she would prefer to face you tomorrow because you played more times . what would you think ?
you were a finalist here last year . how much is that driving you ? you had four finals last year and did n't convert . how much does this drive you ? would you like to get a bit of revenge here ?
last night i 'm not sure what the officially translation was , but you said gavrilova was possessed and playing really , really well .
after the first set how did you mentally stay and try to fight ?
yesterday .
think you 're finally on australian time or still on a bit of german time ?
despite the loss you must be pleased with how you stretch petra and how you hit the ball ?
after the first set , jarka , did you think that maybe an upset was in the air ?
do the five matches , two in brisbane and three in sydney , tell you where you are heading into melbourne ?
did you feel any added pressure knowing you were the only australian female left ?
when things started going , you seemed really calm and collected .
on the outside .
is that a new jarka thing ?
your coach said he was pleased that you did n't get into frustration , that that 's the jarka from the past .
how was your recovery after the late match last night ?
take us through today . first set it was pretty tight . you got the break back there , but then sort of got away from you in the tiebreak .
do you feel you were maybe a little bit flat after yesterday 's match because it was so long ? was it hard to back it up ?
so where does all this leave you going into next week now , do you think ?
do you think it would make any difference to have a summer where you won a tournament or played two tournaments and won five , six more matches , do you think that would make a huge difference to you , or you do n't feel that would make that much difference ?
do n't have a break .
do you think you 're a bit of a slow starter ?
is this slow start a physical thing after the break or more mentally ?
what did simon say when you called him on court ?
what 's your routine going to be like now the next few days ?
can you get any practice matches in ?
you 're serve percentage dropped off in the second set . was that because she was pressing you a bit ?
barbora is the kind of player that does n't give you good rhythm . does that give you difficulty getting into the match ?
( question regarding pressure . )
your opponent 's gotten better over the last year or so . she 's getting pretty good , no ?
you must be tired . you were playing the last , what , nine days or something ?
so by the third set you were saying , i 'm got to go to sleep . it 's too much .
is this your first match being coached by martina ?
hopman cup ? i just wanted to ask what was that like ?
is it good motivation having martina as your coach ? does to motivate and drive you ?
can you talk a little bit about why you picked her and how you arranged to work together ?
how did you two talk ? did you approach her about coaching ?
the crowd and the conditions today , how did that feel ? the crowd were quite vocal .
so no major changes with martina because it just started a month or so ago ? nothing major at this point ? serving ? volleying ?
how much do you want that slam perhaps this year or next year ?
what do you think will be the key to you getting one ?
you won here two years ago . great performance in the final . is there a message you want to say to the people of sydney ? will you be back ?
your fans notice that have realized that you changed from your ponytail to a bun . is that another win of martina 's tactics ?
so it 's not the first time ever up here ?
your ranking sort of dropped a little bit . do you think your results in slams were n't as good as they 've been , was that physical or mental ?
well , 2014 was n't as good as the year before . do you think it was more a physical thing or a mental thing ?
congratulations on your win today . talk us through the match .
what was the difference today ?
did you think much about martina navratilova being the coach of her and this was their first match together ?
how did you find the conditions and the crowd ?
and what are you expecting for the next grand slam , for the australian open next week ?
you 're still a very young player . are you enjoying your time on the tour ? are you excited about it ?
how is sydney for you ? have you had fun here ? have you done stuff outside of just being here ?
that 's a shame . it 's a nice city . so what are you hoping to achieve this year generally moving forward ?
do you know who you 're playing next ?
yes ?
so your thoughts on playing either of them .
physically what 's happening ?
was it last week too at all ? was it hurting at all last week ?
so this was kind of surprising today .
been the last time in a while , no ?
months ?
is it something they told you it 's going to get better in a few days ?
how was the match going before that happened ?
is there any disappointment that you ca n't get to the semifinal or further like you did last year , or more just happy to continue onto the next week and focus on that ?
so what did the doctor say ? two days ? three days ? four days ?
( no microphone . )
what 's a good 2015 going to be for you ?
so you 'll see lindsay soon , i would imagine .
you 're totally ready for that ?
so when she heard about it today was she like , oh , my god , what happened to you ?
talk a little bit about why you guys get along so well .
does she get your sarcasm ?
is that a sarcastic comment ?
is she traveling with the kids ?
is that a different vibe when you have the kids around ? do you get along with them ?
so you can babysit , too .
when they 're crying you can say , okay , bye . see you .
you 're still one of the younger players on the tour and you 've got a long career ahead of you . are you having fun ? is it exciting ? is it good ? are you happy ? i do n't know what i 'm saying .
what about all the changes you see at the top of the game ? do you feel like the top players are really strong or are there some opportunities there to breakthrough ?
did you get to watch any of serena in hopman cup ? what did you think if you did ?
is that going to become a thing now ?
so you 've had coffee during matches ?
how is the wrist ?
when you said it 's something that 's happened before , is it something you typically get over fairly quickly ?
did it hurt last week at all ?
( no microphone . )
overall you should be okay for the next week ? you 're hoping that ?
how long will you stay in sydney ? will you go to melbourne and get treatment there ?
are you concerned it may keep you out ? a bit worried ?
regardless of the wrist , you feel like you 've had enough matches ?
still with one week to go to melbourne , what are your thoughts right now ?
about the wrist .
how pleased are you given the conditions and how hard you had to fight ?
you did n't have the best threeset record against her . what turned it around ?
given that you lost last week in brisbane in the first round , is a match that the kind you need going into next week ?
is the victory a little bit more significant in a way given the opponent , the venue , the way you were up in the third set again ? was it more cathartic , a confidence booster , to win in the manner you did today ?
were there any thoughts going through your head as you stepped up to the line to serve the last ace ?
( no microphone . )
( question regarding social media . )
( question regarding the name bambam . )
do you remember any of the other players ' names ?
at this tournament every year we ask you about the attention and everything else . have you changed your approach to that in any way ? are you more relaxed ?
did you do anything different with your offseason training this year than in the past ?
how was it out there for you today ?
how did you keep yourself mentally alert during all these kind of on and off periods ?
you 've had a lot of success against sam lately ; was there anything noticeably different about her today ?
having a long match like that , even though you lost , is it good preparation for next week ?
talking about going from perth to sydney , what was it like going from the hot , humid weather to the cold , rainy , and windy conditions here ?
( no microphone . )
you 've had a great sort of welldocumented coaching relationship with rob steckley . what is it about that that 's helping you a lot at this stage of your career ?
you also made a really funny video with him recently .
it 's gone viral . something to do with hashtag glitch .
how do you adapt to the heat change ? you 're from such a colder climate , and last year in melbourne was unbelievably hot . what have you done in some of your offseason to prepare you for the heat ?
what do you think it will take to get you into the top 10 this year ? i know that 's a big goal of yours .
you had four really close matches , extremely close matches , and you lost today . how does that prepare you for the australian open ?
aga , coming into this match you had some really tough battles with her . last week at hopman cup she beat you . was there some revenge in this match today perhaps ?
so what was the difference today ? was it perhaps that you played better than in the hopman cup match or was alize not quite as strong ? how do you see it ?
how much confidence did you draw from beating serena in the hopman final ?
you always seem to start strongly in australia . you won here and you 've done well at hopman cup . what is it about australia that brings out your best tennis ?
you get a bit tired .
muguruza next . you played her once or twice before .
thoughts on the match you just played .
is it one of your biggest wins since you won here last year ? flavia is seeded and not far outside the top 10 .
and you have won 12 matches in a row in sydney . what 's it about this place that brings out your best tennis ?
have you spent much time in the city ? done anything fun ?
you went through qualifying . i was wondering if you applied for a wildcard , and your thoughts on not actually getting one .
so was it upsetting for you ?
obviously coming through qualifying last year seemed to do quite well for you . some players like the match practice . is it sometimes easier coming into the main draw with three wins under your belt or starting fresh in the main draw ?
anything in particular you worked on in the offseason ? you seem to have a very good backhand .
playing madison keys next . how are you feeling about that match ?
you must be pretty happy with that win ?
what do you feel like you did better this time ?
what were you telling yourself when you were down 4love in the second set ?
pretty difficult last few years . this must be a real boost for you going into melbourne next week .
what do you think has come together for you to allow to you produce this form now ?
best result since hobart in the fed cup four years ago ?
when you were recovering from that illness , was it the fatigue that was lingering ?
just been a gradual improvement ? no turning point ? just slowly ?
when you were ill , did you have any concerns that you may not come back ?
how do you feel about being moved from the center court yesterday to court 3 ? do you prefer the bigger audience ?
what kept you going when you were n't being offered a lot of hope that you could get back ? what kept you trying ?
where ?
when was it you first became ill ?
your twitter is back open . are the fans being kinder to you ?
why the heavy sigh , jj ?
you told your coach that you were freaking out .
that 's what you said , i thought .
when did those nerves kind of creep in ? was it because you were up 31 in the second ?
how did you feel physically today compared to the others ?
your matches against her have always gone three sets . they have been very tightly contested . another one today . what is it about her ? she 's no.3 now . you have seen her rise up . what makes her special ? consistency ?
a lot of breaks of serves in this match . by product of the great returns , or do you think ...
he 's coached you on your serve before , right ?
miami ?
it 's been 14 years since you played here first time . what do you remember from that time and how do you compare yourself and like physically this tournament to then ?
do you think this tournament is going to give you more ambitions or belief for the weeks to come ?
going back to your serve , you were saying that you struggled with it . was it something you can pinpoint as to why you could n't come up with the goods on your serve ?
she 's usually a quiet player . she was making quite a bit of noise , grunting quite a bit . are you aware of this when you 're out there ?
now that the week is all over , can you reflect what 's happened for you in the last couple of weeks and how tough this tournament was to win ?
( question regarding makarova match in australia ; photographer interference . )
what were you thinking ? what were you feeling as the match went up and down , service break after service break ?
have you ever grunted that much on the court , made that much noise ? you were making a lot of noise after every shot .
yeah .
just today , yeah .
you were facing a lot of high shots . she was throwing up a lot of spins , forehand slices , and things like that . did you change anything tactically as you ...
how is your foot ?
do you think you 're going to play miami ?
as you said , this is the biggest title for your career . it 's too early to talk about , but the no.1 spot for the road to singapore , does it mean anything to you ?
$ 900,000 is a lot of money even for a tennis player . any plans on what you 'd maybe like to buy or spend it on ?
was there something you were dealing with ? seemed times you were bent over . seemed like you were hurt . you had the doctors look at your foot . were there any problems ?
you said that you did n't play well today , but in terms of winning , you just won a premier mandatory tournament without playing your best tennis throughout the past weeks . does that give you confidence , maybe relax you going forward , that you do n't have to play your best all the time ?
then before the tournament how close were you to not playing indian wells ? was it never a thought ? you always were going to play ?
last year you talked about having the goal of making singapore really kind of strong in your mind . do you have any goals this year in your mind ?
you have n't had chance to play serena or maria this season . winning two big titles in a row , does it give you more desire to play against them later this year ?
did you try to lift up that trophy ?
sorry for asking that question .
that was a great win for you . must have been frustrating that she can actually play today .
you said that before this tournament you could n't really train very much .
how much of a surprise is that then ?
back in the day , top no.1 , grand slam finals , all of the success you 've had in the past . seems like nowadays you are playing with maybe a little bit more joy , more relaxed . that 's just the sense that i get . do you feel that way ?
do you think you 're having more fun now than when you were winning buckets of matches ?
so does that mean it 's a different personality with you ? the dramas and emotions and all that ...
serious question on that point : have the two personalities chatted to one another ?
why i 'm asking is because john newcombe had another personality .
who is someone who is the same ?
looking ahead to your semifinal , one , do you know when it is , and two , what are your thoughts on pennetta or lisicki ?
you have good records against both . does that give you confidence , even though it 's way back ?
flavia is a former champion here , like you . the time you won you were playing really well here and had a lot of confidence . how does winning a title here , how much do you think that 's helped her ? she played excellent this year and last year . compare your experiences .
but has confidence helped you through some tough moments here this tournament ?
how much are you familiar with soccer ?
yeah .
you know barcelona and real madrid ?
what do you know about them ?
why i 'm asking the question ?
because we 're doing a story to know how like the stars , tennis stars , are familiar with other sports , and soccer is a big game .
your name is the fed cup list that came out today . was that a result of this week or was it in the plans ?
ana will be there , too .
what would it take for us to see you and ana on the doubles court together ?
in the locker room , what 's the atmosphere like with serena 's comeback this year ? for experienced player like you , how is the atmosphere in the locker room ?
well , yeah .
so you feel good and you 're happy , but a couple years ago obviously struggling . mentioned the back injury at the end of last year . did the r world ever come up ? ever start thinking about life after tennis ?
can you talk about adjustments you made after the first set and a little bit about your return game ? i think you broke her almost every time the next two sets , i think .
seems like you ca n't win these matches in two . you have had a lot of threeset matches . can you talk about that ?
you said you were nervous at the start . was it just because of your past performances against her ?
quite a change in the conditions today . did that affect anything at all ?
can you talk about making the semifinals two years in a row now ? you sounded pretty excited about the prospects of playing serena .
can you clarify that ? you said you feel better , but it seems like last year you had a smoother run to the semifinals .
do you feel any different on the tour this year compared to last year ? bouchard was commenting the other day saying that she now feels like the hunted rather than somebody chasing and being the hunter . do you feel that , as well ?
when you say that you 're feeling the game more in the number of threesetters you 've had , is it because you 're able to keep calm in those situations now and that 's what you mean by feeling the game ?
even when you dropped the a first set ?
just in case , can you talk about bacsinszky if you play against her ?
can you also talk about momentum ? serena 's won 14 straight matches going into tonight 's match , and bacsinszky has won 15 straight . how much do you think that helps and how much does it help mentally going into matches when you 're on streaks like that ?
if it is serena that you play , will you think back to what happened in singapore at all ?
what do you think you learned from both of those matches against her ?
what do you think you could have done better in the first set ?
did you have a conservation of energy ? you seem really calm out there despite the fact you were down a set .
what goes through your mind when you start off 03 and get broken twice ? you seemed really calm . wondering about your mindset and your thoughts .
a few days and three matches into the experience here , how are you feeling emotionally ?
as you mentioned , it 's been sort of an interesting year for sloane , up and down results . obviously she looked pretty sharp out there today . what did you see from her in terms of her potential or getting back on the right track or anything like that ?
did you have any say in the schedule ? were you surprised that it was a day match and not 7:00 ?
towards the end of the match , do you think that level that you were playing in the second and third set , was that the like best level you have played this week ?
a lot of players have been talking about the bounces here , that the ball has been flying and kicking up high . are you feeling the same thing ?
the handshake looked pretty warm . what did you say to her at the net ?
that was one of her best matches of the year . do you feel that players come up against you and they play their best tennis and raise their level against you ?
speaking of best , last week at the bnp paribas showdown in newyork , monica seles was asked who the best player was and the toughest that she 's ever played , and she said you were . put venus to one side . who is the toughest and best player that you 've faced ?
you said when you got here that you felt like you had almost already won the trophy . at this point , can you start to focus on really winning the trophy ?
is it all icing at this point ?
the serve was cranking . 125 might have been the highest . or 128. do you have any desire to beat lisicki now who holds the record for the fastest serve ?
you said that you do n't feel like you have to win the title , but it 's been a while since an american has won in singles . do you think maybe for the fans it would be good to have another american win the title here ?
what do you know about bacsinszky who you play next ? 14match winning streak right now .
do you remember anything about when you played her in rome i think it was couple years ago ? i think she hit a dropshot off a serve of yours and you were n't happy about it , if i remember .
have you thought about the prospects of if you did win this tournament going from a 19 year old the last time you won it and now at 33 to win it ? that 's unusual and kind of unique , and also says a lot about the quality of play and longevity . has that crossed your mind ?
is the kind of experience you 're having from the crowd , ambiance , setting , is it the kind of thing you want to do again ?
commiserations , but you put up a hell of a fight out there .
she 's a woman who is on the verge of getting into the top 10 and you 're toe to toe with her . must give you enormous confidence .
when you look forward miami , do the conditions suit you better there than here ? obviously the ball is not going to be bouncing six inches above your head all of the time .
so like going home .
what are your immediate plans between now and miami ? first flight there or ...
could you just tell us a little bit about diego , what he does for you , why you two work so well together ?
you 're a very different player now than before you were working with him . the change is very marked and remarkable .
what sort of bloke is he ? good sense of humor ? football fan ?
so makes it fun as well as getting the job done ?
you get the first set ; tough set . talk about your play and kind of how you felt the match went .
what do you think she did better in the second and third set that as different than what she was doing in the first set ?
serving ? better off the ground ? what you were seeing ?
overall , how happy are you with this week ? seems like a pretty good step in the right direction .
was there a turning point in the third set where you felt the match kind of changed ?
does she bring out your best ? seems like you were playing better than you have in the rest of the tournament .
did you feel you let down in the start of the second or third sets ?
what did you say to one another at the end of the match ?
she 's just a colleague , but does it feel different when you play against serena than other players ?
when did under armour start making straw hats ?
when you have to go from the desert to really humid conditions in miami , how does it affect your game ? a lot of the guys were saying yesterday that they felt yesterday that the ball , everything was moving really quickly out here .
what are you most happy with in your game from this tournament ?
had you stopped enjoying it ?
how do you tap into that joy ? what do you do ?
how enjoyable was it to win that tiebreaker ? you had to really fight to win that .
when do you think you 're going to win your first grand slam ? we know you are , but when ?
what happened there in the third set ?
did you lose your own rhythm as the match went on ? why is she a tough matchup for you ?
could you tell she was crying ?
yes .
you never saw her when she left the court after the first set ?
did you sense there was a lot of emotion in her when she left the court ? she said she left the court and had a good cry .
when you are having this kind of loss where you 're maybe not finding your best tennis , what 's going through your mind ? what 's the reaction ? how big a disappointment or not ?
in the nba , they talk about back to backs . you had a tough back to back here . was that tough ? any kind of influence tonight ?
how is your shoulder ? is it feeling good or bothering you a little ?
service game these last two nights , there were the double faults . was it anything you can put your finger on ? there have been other players talking about they were struggling with different things . anything bothering you at this tournament ?
there has been a lot of tennis for you since the start of the season . could this be an explanation why maybe this week or this match you have n't played your best ?
will you take time off before miami or go right back into business ?
big win for you . how do you feel at this moment ?
were you crying in the first set there ?
was it just kind of a panic attack or ...
can you explain that a little bit ? because we were watching it and we saw you go off the court after the first set .
you broke down . how did you
how did you do that ?
did you just go and cry ?
how willing are you to tell us what is making you so emotional ?
is everything okay in your life ?
with that emotion and letting those emotions out , was there a sense of maybe you can see your title going , as well ?
you had beaten her the last few times you had played her , maria . so your thoughts of beating her again ?
last year after every match in the first round to the end you were up and happy , and today this is a big win . you seem kind of subdued .
so you 're emotional a lot , but i hear you may not play after this year . is that true ? what are your thoughts that way ?
no , this year .
this could be the last one .
after three wins in a row against her , is there a single part of your game that kind of matches up and is the difference between you ?
yeah .
so after the first set you came back out . did you say , okay , i 'm not afraid now ?
what is her game 's biggest challenge ? obviously she 's very powerful , consistent , big server . you have beaten here twice now in about a month . what is it about her game you have been able to match up well against ?
is that something you had to learn ? i remember you said it was i think it was in doha or dubai where you were saying you need to become a fighter girl .
you said that you feel like your game has been improving as this tournament has gone along . what specifically have you seen that 's improved ?
just in your game in general .
has it been tough having a lot of different coaches in a short time , having a lot of different voices ?
you have a lot of romanian fans obviously . lepchenko match , especially . the amount of support you get all around the world now , how happy does that make you ?
i see moldovan flags and flags and bulgarian flags . everyone wants a part of you .
tough result . talk a little bit about the match , how you felt it all sort of went .
when you say you 're not happy with how you played , can you break it down ? like other than the unforced errors , specifically footwork , shot selection , whatever ?
how was it to sort of have lindsay come out , rounds of applause , etcetera , etcetera ? ( sorry i could n't hear her ?
today was not that day .
how much can you take in in that 30 seconds ? what do you try to take in in that 30 seconds ?
looking forward to the rest of the season , the u.s. is going to play fed cup in italy . can you tell us how you see the match for the u.s. ?
in that third set it looked like the backhand was n't cranking , especially down the line . when you see that happening , you just kept doing it ?
even though lindsay told you not to do it ?
your stubbornness ? explain the logic . put me in your head in that moment .
perfect .
excited for that .
realistically having been out for so long , was it unrealistic to think you 'd do well after all that time out ?
are you going to head straight to miami and try and get ready there ? take a couple days off ?
do you think that 's the best thing right now ?
talk about , if you could , the move from boca . now seems like you 're based in la , right ?
ish ?
you have spent a lot of time training out this way . does it feel different to you in terms of , i do n't know , being so comfortable in florida for so long and being based there for so long ? everything in 2015 seems pretty new ?
how big is this win for you at this point of the season ?
can you talk about the pace coming off of the racquet for madison ? what is it like ...
how was it to have your mom back courtside ?
did she miss it , the time away ?
kind of a change of pace the next round against bencic . can you talk about that , playing her , the change of pace and your thoughts ?
what were your memories of that match you guys had last year at the us open ?
in brisbane you sounded pretty pessimistic about your back and everything . how are you feeling now ? are you feeling back to good ?
in the second set it started to look like a lot of psychology out there . it was very interesting to watch . you slowed down the pace of play a lot . you 'd walk over to get the towel and walk back . it was interesting to see what you were doing . that kind of played a big factor , especially in the second and third set . she was pumped up and ready to go .
but also you did something i have never seen before . you challenged the second point of the match .
do you know that you have one of the lowest challenging success rates ?
what makes you a california girl ? what 's the most california thing about jelena jankovic ?
can you do one ?
say dude a lot .
do you complain about traffic a lot ?
it 's a big thing .
you can try doing that .
moving away from the california stereotypes . going back to madison , you mentioned her power , comparing it to serena 's power . how does it rate with petra 's power ? how does that ball feel when you hit it ?
can you talk about the difference between today and the first time you played caroline ?
did that loss , when you played her the first time , affect you , the fact it was so lopsided ?
when you talk about the game plan and executing your game plan today , what was it ? how do you attack a player like caroline ?
i think this is your first win over a top 5 player .
i think so , yeah .
how does that make you feel ?
how do you handle the pressure of being so good so young ?
how much are you working with melanie molitor ?
that relationship , do you expect that relationship to go on for a while when you 're home ?
what do you think she 's expecting out of you this year ?
you were talking about dealing with highs and lows . i know you have had tough lows . you seem to handle them maturely . what do you try to do to handle them through the bad times ?
your first win over a top 5 player was mentioned . what will this do for your confidence , do you think ?
how close do you think you are to going deep at a tournament like this , deep in the tournament or winning ?
do you feel ready ?
you 're still quite fresh off juniors . did you imagine it would be so quick coming off of juniors to beating wozniacki , getting to us open quarterfinal ?
since martina is at your matches a lot , has she ever , later in that afternoon , offer a little advice , free coaching advice ?
can you talk about the next round ? it could be jankovic or keys .
can you talk about playing each one , what your thoughts are .
had you played madison before ?
how did that match go then ?
good memory .
now that this month you turned 18 , so the age restrictions have gone . did you sort of make like a little belinda advent calendar where you cross off each day ?
after all the attention on the first round , did you get relaxed and back to normal at all ?
looking back , how draining of a day was that , going through all the emotions up and down ? what was it like yesterday and coming into this match ?
were you more relaxed than you thought you 'd be in this second match ?
many tennis experts , they consider you one of the best , if not the best , tennis player ever . what do you think of that ?
when you look at this young group of africanamerican female players following you sloane , taylor townsend , madison keys are you awed by yours and your sister 's effect on these young players ?
in this whole process since you just made the decision to come back here , what 's been the most interesting thing that 's happened ? do you think it 's been a growth experience for you ?
in what way ?
any sort of satisfaction or realization that a lot of people watching here have never seen you before in person ?
you could get sloane next . she 's up in the first set . can you talk about that , and also kuznetsova if you get her ?
would you mind reflecting on the first time you won here ? when you look back at it now , you and steffi are , by numbers , the two winningest players in terms of titles in the open era . that was one of the few times you played steffi . can you talk about your recollections of that ? looking back at it now , maybe the significance it has in terms of the history of the sport .
and at that time , what did it mean to beat steffi ? you were a teenager and she had so many grand slam title . what were the emotions of that playing her and beating her in a final ?
chris evert said yesterday the fact that you did n't have a longterm rival other than your sister early on makes what you have accomplished that much more impressive . do you wish you would have had a rival all these years ? do you think it would have made you all that better ?
can you share what your father said to you and also what venus said to you after the other night ?
how close to tournament mode are you at this point ?
the last couple of weeks was full of sentimental emotions . you mentioned that you had an xo in la before the tournament . when was the last time you went back to compton ?
have you ever been to croatia , and when will we see you playing a tournament in croatia ? ever ?
smaller tournaments , though .
very small .
when were you in croatia ?
in 2015 your schedule has been quite different from what you normally do . you went to australia , to argentina for the fed cup , you were supposed to go to the middle east , and now you have come here after not coming for so many years . can you run us through the rationale of so many changes in the way you go through your season ?
your sister already played acapulco , mexico . is it in your plans in the near future to play there ?
top 10 first win . does that make you feel happy , confident ? big moment ?
what did you think when you lost your break ? she won four straight games . you did n't panic obviously .
you seemed to be nerveless out there . what were you feeling inside ? were you nervous ?
i was surprised to hear this was your first win against a top 10 because you have always played well . was this something a long time coming ?
you played her last year
and this year . anything you learned from last year 's match and the one earlier this year that helped you today ?
so you 've got one over on radwanska . diego has now got one over on martina . diego must be chuffed .
is there something about indian wells and the desert that has , you know , provided you with more confidence ? because you 're kind of coming through the draw unexpectedly .
is there something you point to as to what clicked ?
how about your next round ? you have either suarez navarro or anastasia . could you tell us a little bit about both opponents who you might play ?
you seem very calm for having your first win against a top10 player . is that how you do feel inside ? is this just another win for you , or do you feel like this is a major moment in your career ?
with a win like this , can you start entertaining the thought that this is a tournament that you can win ?
getting it done in straight sets . what were you able to get done well today ? lucie is a tough opponent .
when the ball is flying on you a lot of players say that 's a big challenge at indian wells but when the ball is flying off your racquet and you 're having trouble controlling it , what do you do to try and get the control back ?
this is your third win i believe over a lefthanded player . is there something about lefties that gets you going or , do you like playing them ?
so what did you work on in the offseason ?
when you talk about footwork , you mean the footwork around the ball ?
or speed ?
did you think about what your goals would be at the start of the season for this season , like what are your targets ?
the cap ? aj ? what 's that ?
what does it stand for , aj ?
we wo n't mention it .
i 'm curious about when you played maria in brisbane the first set did n't go very well for you . then i think you were down like 41 in the second set , and then you started to like reel off all these games in the end . is it just because at that point you were was it they were looser ? you understand what i 'm saying ?
i saw that you like to drive cars .
if you win stuttgart you can get a porsche .
did you ever drive one ?
how fast ?
you may play makarova in the next round . the match is not over yet , but it might be another lefty for you . do you have any comments on that ?
have you had any coaching changes in the offseason or are you still working with the same coaches ?
topsyturvy match . second , third set , dropped serve . then you broke . what was going on ?
what do you feel went well in your game today ?
you have had a pretty tough draw here beating out two former top 5 at least players . how happy are you with your first week here ?
do you feel it was a result you needed at some level , that you were searching for this sort of good run ?
you 're playing serena next . what are you going to do to get ready for that match ? what are you expecting from her ?
what are you expecting from her ? did you watch her play today ?
the last couple of weeks , have you played better overall ?
with the coach , everything like that , i know it took a little while in january , february , but you seem to look better overall .
more confident overall coming in to indian wells ?
you used to be a little bit chummy with serena , and then after you beat her in the australian open 2013 she sort of cut ties with you . i 'm just wondering , what 's your relationship with her like now ?
i 'm just like have you mended fences with her ?
colleague .
so i think nick came out at least once on the court .
what kind of things was he saying to you ? what 's it like hearing that voice in a competitive environment ?
does it mean anything to you that two africanamerican women are meeting here in the fourth round after what happened to serena a long time ago ? does that sort of up the stakes for you or make it more important or interesting or special ?
there was a lot made of your relationship with serena good and bad , i guess in 2013. the three matches you played against her were all very competitive . how do you look back on that time , the attention that was there ? a lot of good and bad , i guess , during that stretch .
there has been some players when they play serena they ca n't rise up to the occasion , but you have all three times . why do you think you 're able to raise to your level to play to the no.1 player in the world and maybe other people have n't been able to ?
do you remember when you beat her aussie open 13 , beat her in the quarterfinals ? were you really , really happy ? do you remember that day ?
yeah . was it the best match you played ? you beat serena in quarters . that was a big win .
2013 was n't that long ago .
every time i have mentioned you on twitter , which i know you think is a lot ...
anyway , any time i 've mentioned you i have all these serena fans immediately criticizing you out of nowhere .
why do you think that is ?
just taking some getting used to . it 's jarring . you get it more and more directly .
if you were to estimate , how many people have you blocked ?
more than a thousand ?
are you more protective of yourself on twitter ? you obviously , early on on twitter , were much more expressive , and now it 's maybe a little more stringent .
any idea how this happens ? seems like you get the brunt of it worse than a lot of people ?
did you ever get to the point where you would just get off twitter ? what keeps you coming back when there is all this and i have n't seen them . i 'm just learning about them .
what will make you happy against serena in two days ?
and play well , i assume .
14 this a row now . how does that feel ?
down 30 , double break in the third set , do you still feel like you have forgotten how to lose and you 're going to win anyway ?
do you feel like you 're starting a really special year here ? just based on , you know , the race to singapore , now you 're 10th . so you 're really close .
yeah .
do you feel like you 're really playing , you know , that well ? that sort of top , toplevel tennis ?
do you have goals for this year ?
how do you feel physically at this point ? how much work have you put into your fitness condition ?
how much work you have putting ...
yes .
when you were a junior , top junior , how different were your expectations then to how your career has panned out now ?
i want to talk about your dog . how important is him in your life that you are traveling all the world with him ?
a lot of people ask you what 's going through your head during matches . i 'm curious , when it comes to the really critical moments , do you even formulate thoughts with words in your head or are you speaking to yourself or are your thoughts visceral reactions , you know what to do and it 's pure instinct at that juncture ?
you had great matches against azarenka in the past . how do you see the next one ?
she 's coming back from injury , and you know what it takes . is it tricky to play a player like this compared to previous years ?
is it the rivalry you enjoy ? you have had rivalries with serena . is there something special with azarenka ? something different ?
first match since australia . how did you feel out there ? scoreline did n't look too rusty , at least .
what 's the last month been like since you became madison , grand slam semifinalist ?
what advice has lindsay been giving you since australia ?
how can you not be happy with what happened in australia ?
did you feel forgotten about the last month ?
this was lindsay 's first oncourt coaching visit today . were you nervous or excited about that ? i know she talked before about being sort of nervous or reluctant to go out there .
she got a little round of applause , which most coaches do n't get walking off court .
have you thought about this rise of your players of color like yourself , how remarkable it is and maybe how it felt .
did you see serena 's match last night ? what 's your take on that whole thing ? were you pleased to see her back ?
did you come close to playing at any point since australia ? did you come close to playing anywhere at any time ?
how is the adductor ?
the adductor .
what was it like watching millionaire with sam querrey ?
can he go back on there ?
what were his highlights and his low lights ?
what other player would you nominate for millionaire matchmaker ?
madison , speaking of reality shows , on survivor now they divide it into blue collar working class is one tribe and then white collar , executives , and then there is no collar , freeform . of blue collar , white collar , no collar , what 's your tribe ? what are you most like ?
do you think fans do n't really understand all of the incredible work that has to go in day in and day out for all of the players ? it 's a bit of a gap ?
do you think if there was not venus and serena you 'd be here today ?
after this , what 's your next goal ?
as a tennis fan , did you take a look at today 's schedule ? on the outer courts there are four former no.1 players and they are playing on like courts , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6. do you have any thoughts about that as like a fan that , you know , there is an opportunity to see a former no.1 on a small , intimate court ? just your thoughts about that as a fan .
jankovic or lauren davis next . talk about each of them briefly .
conditions here ? ball flies , but fairly high bouncing . seems like it would probably suit you .
all great athletes basically focus on the immediate future , like you said today . coming back from australia , what was your inner thoughts ? did you feel , wow , i finally made a breakthrough , i can really emerge , or was it more a matter of fact ? could you just share with us what your thoughts are ?
are you having more demands on your time now for press ? how do you balance that with spending time training ?
would you go on millionaire matchmaker ?
were you surprised that sam agreed to do it ?
would you ever go on a reality tv show ?
what kind of shows would make the cut then ? cooking or ...
( indiscernible . )
talk about your baking . do you get into a reflective mood ? what 's your favorite thing to bake ?
you do n't eat what you bake ?
( question regarding bakeoff . )
how was it out there ?
heat an issue at all at this point ?
you had a really successful australia , sort of back to the grind . bring me up to date . what have you been up to ?
do you feel like a different player after australia , or do you think people see you differently ?
what 's your next goal after this one ?
what do you do to prepare for the clay court ?
what 's the toughest part to adjusting to the tour at this level ?
with the exception of one little hiccup in the first set , fairly simple opening match .
how 's it feel to be back after having such a big run last year here ?
when you come back , is it easy to banish memories of what happened last year in the final , or is that lurking always in the back of your mind ?
you spoke earlier this week about having martina as part of your team . apart from her wealth of experience , what is the one thing that stands out that makes her a good coach in your mind ?
with martina , what is she advising you with ? what are some of the things that she would like to change , things that she would like to leave as they are ? do you also talk with her about the experiences that she 's had and get some stories from the past ?
would you say she surprised you with some things storywise ? can you remember any at the moment ?
so what 's going to be the first thing that you work on when you practice later today or whenever you practice ? what will be the first thing you learn from your match today , your win today ? what would you work on first ?
if you lose a match like sydney you lost early , martina arrived and you had lost and it was all over if you lose a match , if you win a match , what are some of the things that she might say to you ? if you lose does she get angry with you or does she have a way of saying things ?
how would you assess your form so far this season ? what 's pleased you ? what has n't pleased you ?
what expectations do you have on yourself now that you 've got martina in your corner ?
when you have a win , do you have any type of celebration ? i know you have to get ready for the next match , but is there any type of celebration with that particular win ?
i 'm sure i speak for a lot of people , condolences about the tragedy in your family . was it good to get out and play a first match and get that behind you ? what did you go through to make a decision to even stay and play ?
with your win today , what would you think would be the first thing that you practice on when you practice later today or tomorrow ? what do you think you do that you would need to practice on ? what would be the first thing that you would need to practice on ?
yeah .
how are the conditions ?
one of the places where i teach there are quite a few romanians , and they are talking about halep , halep , halep . you have a lot of great support . i just wanted to let you know they are definitely , oh , my gosh . so tell us a little bit about your you still live in romania , correct ?
would you consider moving somewhere else , or romania would be the only place you would consider as far as possibly living ?
your results have gotten you a lot of attention in the past . do you feel pressure at all now ?
what does it mean for you to be able to fight back like you were able to after a little bit of a tough start in that match ?
what do you feel like was the turning point for you ?
you 're familiar , i would imagine , with both players who are going to play the big match tonight in a few hours . what are your thoughts on the match , and what are your thoughts on serena coming back to play this tournament ?
you 're on her side of the draw .
do you look at the draw as a whole , or do you ...
many people , when they think about you , they think about a smart player . they say , oh , she 's smart . she knows how to strategically play those points . do you have any comment in that regard , that people , you know , many people say , you 're a smart player .
you 're very smart .
that strategically you play the points very smart .
are you feeling 100 % better with regard to the rib injury that you had ?
how long have you felt free of pain ?
some of the players say that the balls are flying . can you comment on that and what do you think the courts are like ? are they playing slow ? fast ?
how many pounds you put on your racquet , string ?
what does it mean for you this period in your life , this period in which you have won two tournaments and now you won a lot of matches in three sets ? great moment , great matches , and so on .
how did you find the conditions outside today ?
fairly hot and sweaty night .
when you called out sven on the court in the first set , what were the words there ? what you did you need or what did you want to say to him ?
a turning point ?
i was thinking in the second set when she was up 40love and you broke her .
what does it mean for the australian open ? is this the sort of highquality match you need before a grand slam ?
two hours 40 minutes against a top 10 player . is that an indication of how the preseason has gone ?
close to no.1 ? do you care ?
what was going through your head after the second set when she took the medical timeout ? same thing happened in cincinnati .
yeah . could you please talk a little bit about your coaching with sven .
can i ask you about your schedule ? on your website says you 're going to play fed cup .
it because all the players have to play because olympics ? you have to get your fed cup up ? why are you playing fed cup basically ?
would you like to win a fedcup with russia ? it 's one thing you have n't got on your quite extensive cv .
you still like the olympics too , and obviously that 's part of what 's going on with it , too , right ?
talk a little bit about that :
chances , huh ? sort of up and down the whole way .
were you really hurt third set ? you took the medical timeout .
so it was okay ?
coming back from that 3nil , when you were 3nil down , was that the turning point ?
i know it 's only one tournament , but how does that set you up ? you 're not playing sydney ?
you will just prepare for melbourne ?
four titles in 2014 and tokyo was great for you . feel like your level is close to that ?
what would you have done today ? you were so close with her .
so if you win a grand slam in two or three weeks , would you be real happy ?
could you actually do it ? semifinals ? finals ?
pretty well overall . she pushed a little bit at the end , but got through there .
looking forward to tomorrow 's match , ana had a bit of trouble finishing off today as well . is it just par for the course at this time of the season ?
talk a little bit more . last year played her four times , 2all . you 've been playing her since 2006. you know her well . what 's the key for you ?
ana said the final is very special . do you approach the final any differently to any other match , or just the same ?
talk about 2008 aussie , beating her i believe 75 , 63 in the final . classic . pretty close overall .
do you feel like you 've gotten everything you wanted out of brisbane in terms of time on the court and a chance to work on things ?
talk us through that last few games . up 51 in the second set .
no sense of panic at all ?
lepchenko 's comeback against stosur when she was down 51 , was that in the back of your mind at all ?
how would you describe you week in terms of preparation for the australian open ?
how is the abdominal ?
you played maria sharapova four times last year pretty close . cincy was 75 in the third . kind of talk about it if you play her tomorrow .
not to call things before they happen , but same we question with svitolina . the indian wells match i remember being quite a war .
you remember in 2008 , aussie against maria in the final . talk about your memories of that .
so you were thinking , i can actually win this before you went on the court ?
you been in melbourne before you came here .
how long you been in australia ?
to do some training ?
overall just been more consistent week to week , month to month , which took a while , but why now ?
you been more consistent over the last year , much more improved . why ?
yeah , you overall .
i think if the wta had a mostlikelytofalldownduringamatch award that you would win . what 's up with that ?
played very well . talk about the match overall .
how do you see the semifinal matchup ?
are you looking forward to having a tough match leading up to the australian open . today looked like you were pretty comfortable out there . did n't have to push yourself too hard . hoping for a tougher match as we get closer to melbourne ?
were you relieved with how quickly you got momentum after the game where you needed a lot of break points to convert ?
i 'm sure you spoke about the offseason , but just talk a little bit about it . any major change or little things ?
i saw you had the ice towel on today . it was very hot last year but not as hot this year .
what was your choice behind that ?
good to see marcus weber in your corner out there today .
is he a keen supporter ?
at this time of the year heading into the grand slam , do you keep an eye on the highly ranked girls ? serena seems to have some sort of fatigue issue in perth . do you look at the main players at different tournaments and scout yourself , or do you focus on what you 're doing ?
i have been asking some people this : if you were at an event tournament and they played music when you walked on court , do you have one song where you say , i want to hear this ?
so you still want to hear that ?
if there were three songs they could play for you at australian open , what would they be ?
can i ask about bastien ? is he still around ?
you were slipping some . is it the surface , or you were just being slippery tonight ?
tough day . she 's obviously very good player .
you played recently well the last , what , three days more or less ?
the way she played today she 's a good player , huh ?
second set was very close .
you played a ton last year , huh ? almost every week ?
good thing in a way .
so you 're playing much better how ? physically ? mentally ?
but you been playing since you were a kid ?
as far as being smarter , what are you doing ?
so you know more , basically .
so overall you 're very happy you 're top 100 now for the first time ? that must be big , huh ?
what happened there ?
yeah , i would imagine . how long were you out ? weeks ?
boy , that 's rough . could n't run around or walk around ?
and you could n't swim ?
so when you got to run again , did it feel okay ?
it was n't , i 'm tired , i 'm tired ?
do you work with your mom ?
not at all ?
but she used to ...
what about your traveling ? usta people or all by yourself ?
that 's not going to be easy , though , right ? almost everyone has a coach .
what is your goal this year overall ?
top 80 ? 70s ? maybe 50 ?
but you feel like when you 're playing the best players you 're close to everyone ; you 're not getting crushed by them .
you 're in there .
okay . good luck next week .
very clinical . feel as good as it looked ?
when you 're so far ahead , 60 , is it harder to hold your concentration than if it was 4all , 5all ?
did you expect a challenge or did you just feel you were really on ?
do you keep an eye on the performances of the sort of top 20 players at this time of year ? can you judge anything by the results you see ?
must be feeling pretty good about your game overall after that performance first up .

you talk about lots of game time . is that the key to preparing for this first grand slam , really getting that match fitness ?
obviously not the result you wanted , but you fought really hard out . you must 've been proud of that effort .
the way you fought your way back into the game , and especially in the second set compared with how you started , was it just nerves ? can you explain the two different shapes of that game ?
how were the nerves at the end ? you saved a couple match points .
where does that fight come from ? it 's obviously a major strength of yours and something you develop yourself . it 's something everybody can have , but you seem to have it more than other players . where does that come from ?

makes all qualifying worthwhile when you get through the first round .
bit of a test for you concentrationwise because you had the rain stoppages ?

you played angelique many times , 5all until today . how do you rate that performance ?
do you think you won because of the way you were playing or she was n't playing up to her standard ?
you have so much variety in your game . are you happier when you hit a clean winner off of power or a strategic winner catandmouse style ?
this is the third time you qualified for the semifinals in the last five years . maybe you 're good at some tournaments at the end of the season . do you think so ?

in an instance when jovanovski is winning four games in a row like she did in the end of the match , what is your strategy in a time like that when an opponent is zoning , what do you do ?

how are you feeling about that match ? coco seemed to be getting some momentum towards the end . were you surprised she pulled out ?

how much of a problem was your shoulder ?
where exactly were you feeling the pain in the shoulder ?
was it more difficult to motivate for this year in china compared to last year ? is that something that you see as a difference between the two seasons ?
speaking of singapore , i 'm sure you have n't thought about it a ton , but when you look at the next two weeks , are you more tempted to just sit back and see whether or not you can qualify based on the other results and take the next two weeks off , or are you going to play indoors and try and qualify on your own ?
actually , you played very well today . there were a lot of winners . i want to say , how do you feel about this match ? sometimes you can win very easily , but sometimes you can lose very easily , too , especially for the key moments . why ? you came to the net , but the results were not very good . is it because of the communication with your coach or because of your own thinking to come to the net ?
just now you said that flavia is more experienced . can you be more specific ? in which areas is flavia or experienced or sophisticated ? when you meet those older players , is it only the experience ?
last time you played flavia , also in beijing , was so different .
just now you mentioned that as for the asian players , in china , we have so many toplevel matches . young players may have more chances than you when you were young . do you think it will be good for those younger players to help them to become more experienced ? as for you , what do you need to do to improve your level of play ?
you say many young players have more chances . this is your seventh time here in the china open . chinese players have more and more chances to play . as for the china open , maybe you have fewer chances than the younger players . so what do you think about it ?
just now you mentioned that you need to find your own trainer and coach . does it mean you are flying solo ?
what kind of support do you need from the national team ? what is your financial situation and what is your schedule compared with previous days ?

when you had the one breakpoint , was her serve just on today ?
petra said it 's hard to put your friendship aside sometimes , if you make a mistake or she makes a mistake . is it the same for you ?
what about the coordinating outfits ?
can you talk about going into your next match .
did this tournament give you what you expected from it ?
petra played very well today , did n't she ?
how deflating was that 12th game of the first set ?
your knee was bothering you in the second set ?
you said the difference in the second set was she elevated her game a little bit more . was she going for bigger shots ?
do you find it tough to get into a rhythm against petra , given how she hits so many winners and errors ?
you mentioned getting back to basics . what did you do in the second set to do that ?
are you feeling very good about your game right now with the run that you 're on ?
this is your first time back here since 2012 .
what kept you away and what made you decide to come back this year ?
a sister , you said ?
whereabouts ?
how many members of your family were here today ?
can you talk about your potential opponents in the final .
do you go into every tournament expecting to win , or sometimes are you just thinking to yourself , okay , i need to get into a few matches ? did you expect to go on this type of run ?
will you watch tonight 's match ?
has your success in doubles this year helped you in singles or has it been the other way around ?
we should call you the lucky winner , forget lucky loser .
what are you doing ? kind of inspired you since that happened .
did it take the pressure off ? or the fact when you got the call , you were ready to go home basically , go to new york , kind of relaxing or ...
you 've played a lot of matches from the qualifier till now . how do you feel physically ?
does winning these two matches here in the main draw make up for a little disappointment you might have had in qualifying ?
your success this year against top10 opponents , is it because you do relax , do n't feel the pressure , or do you elevate your game a little bit ?
have you been in this position before , where you 've gotten into the main draw through somebody pulling out , win some matches , make it to the semifinals ? has this happened before ?
do you feel like things are coming together any better now than you felt in the past ? do you feel like things are clicking , you 're feeling it ?
that seemed like a real grinder out there .
does she pose a lot of problems for players because she 's like a backboard ?
when you got to the end , what was your feeling ?
were you sharp today then ?
are you mentally tougher now ? is that why you can stay in there with her and just get better each time , finally break through and win today ?
what do you know about playing tomorrow ?
what 's the deal with the colored fingernails , the red ?
did the french open just give you an awful lot of confidence for this year ? i know you struggled a little bit right after that , but you said that was coming down from the clouds .
is it confidence that put you into the top 10 ?
have you stepped your game up just a little bit this year ?
threesetters , all really long matches .
what was the difference in the end ?
what 's made her a little bit better this year ? is she more mature or experienced ?
what 's the toughest part of playing her ?
when you say you 're still focused and want to play , think about the next match , do you really think you 'll be able to play next week in beijing ?
is it easy when you 're playing a match not to be thinking , okay , maybe i 'm hurting myself really badly , or is it easy to block this out ?
i 'm wondering if there was a moment maybe early in the first set where obviously there 's stress in the back of your mind physically whether or not you can play at your best , but maybe a missed shot from her or a point she played and did n't play the way she wanted that gave you kind of confidence ?
in between the lines , what were you particularly pleased with with how you were able to execute today ?
this is your biggest title since dubai back in 2010. what does that mean for you ? what do you think it means about this part of your career ?
with this result , you 'll be top 8 in the road to singapore .
yeah . so singapore is a possibility . sounds like you 're shocked by that . what would it mean to potentially be able to qualify ?
that 's our job .
watching you play this week , just the level you were able to maintain across the tournament , it kind of made a few of us think , gosh , if only she were on the other side of the draw at wimbledon or the us open . does that ever cross your mind at all ?
we noticed last night eagle eye . maybe you think that is a missjudge . how do you get into the court without eagle eye ?
i am one of your fans and also i bring my parents here to wuhan to watch you play , especially with radwanska , a very late game , and also a wonderful performance . i want to know will you be here in wuhan next year and what are your expectations ?
( no microphone . )
the first set , you were n't that far .
do you know if you 're going to be okay in a few days ?
you mentioned the leg and also the ankle , which we saw you hurt yesterday . which was it ? which was the primary reason why you decided to retire today ?
did you get any specific treatment or special treatment between yesterday 's match and today ?
can you talk about this week , just generally how pleased you were to make the final and what this sort of result means to you .
on monday you 'll make your top 5 debut .
aside from the very big smile that you have , what does that sort of mean for you and what does it say about your season ?
could you explain why you 've been late for a while .
you delayed the time for almost an hour . what did you do in the past hour ?
have you shared the news with your sister ?
about winning the game .
so you 've already shared with her ?
a tough match and a physically grueling one . talk us through the ups and downs throughout and how you were able to close it out in the final tiebreaker .
after you had the 52 lead , she started to battle back . talk a little bit about your mindset and how you turned that around , not get down on yourself and frustrated .
what does it mean to you to make the final here this week ?
you had a tough match yesterday , a tough match today . you fought very hard to get out of these situations . how do you feel for the recovery for the final ? do you feel it 's going to be fine or are you a bit worried about it ?
is playing a final now at this state of your career as exciting as it was at the start ? are the emotions different ? what does it mean for you at this stage of your career ?
during the fight , when it 's so late and tough , you still find it thrilling ? are you still enjoying the fight when it 's late , you 're tired , battling on every point ?
was the preparation for wuhan and this asian swing any different than your preparation for other tournaments at all ? did you arrive here feeling better physically or better prepared , anything like that ?
in this match you just mentioned that you have more opportunities to win , but your opponent depended on her tactics , for example the backhand slice . so for her techniques , what is your comment ?
some words on your next opponent , muguruza or kerber ?
second set tiebreak .
just now during the game when it was 25 , you were in the lead , it seemed your left leg had some injury . will that influence your following match ?
are you satisfied with the result ? it 's the same as the us open , the hard court , the opponent from the williams family . however , the result is totally different . are you satisfied with that ?
in the third set venus seemed to be inflicted with injuries . do you think that is something you should have taken advantage of ?
you came back really well in the third set , served for the match . have you any regrets on this 65 game ?
you seemed pretty angry at the time she was taking between points at the end . do you want to comment on that ?
you called your coach out quite a few times . what was it that he was telling you ?
in the first set she raced out to a 3love lead , then you seemed to be able to make some adjustments to turn it around . talk through what changed in the first set .
were you surprised by how much she was coming to the net early on ?
do you enjoy that ? you passed her quite a few times .
you 'd rather baseline ?
what do you take away from this week ? what is the lesson that you 've learned ?
in talking with your coach , since you only practiced a couple days before you got here , do you feel you need to practice anymore ?
from your eyes , what is the difference between the sisters ?
did you feel a little bit regretful that there is no grand slam left this year because you feel so good right now ?
did you feel the fire of revenge during this match ?
what is your first impression about the wuhan open ?
and playing in the new stadium ?
can you talk about the end of the match . you looked worried about the ankle . how bad is it ?
is it the same foot you had a bad injury before ?
talk through the sequence of events of what happened . you felt it , then you kept playing , then asked for the trainer ?
are you concerned at all about tomorrow and having to play a final tomorrow ?
aside from the injury , talk about the match a little bit . you have to be pleased with how you were able to play and eventually close it out .
how do you feel about playing venus in this final ?
talk about the end of the match . you were 53 down . what did you do ?
if you had n't won that second set , could you have played a third one ? would you have withdrawn ?
was the stress or worry you had once you started to have when you felt pain in your foot , was it more because you were nervous about what the injury might be or was it the pain ?
does it still hurt when you walk now ?
do you remember the first time you ever saw venus play a match ?
a lot of people kind of equate their games , say they play the same way . do you see they play any differently ? how is playing venus different than playing serena ?
what do you identify as being different with venus ?
when you arrived here in wuhan after everything from the summer , did you expect a result like this from yourself , to make the final ? what were your expectations ?
you were down a break in that final set . talk about those last few games . what were you telling yourself and how did you turn it around ?
it was impressive just how well you were defending in the last few games , really using your legs after such a grueling match . talk about balancing being aggressive and hitting your shots , going big versus she was kind of slugging away as well ?
are you thinking about singapore at all and possibly being able to qualify ?
it can happen .
quick question about serena , who pulled out of the rest of the season today . as a person who probably knows her best in the world , what do you think she 's going through right now ?
she said that she was going to withdraw from the beijing open [ sic ] and singapore .
you faced many , many players in your career . what do you think about konta , the way she 's playing lately ? how do you assess how far she can go ?
next up is roberta vinci , someone you saw last month . talk about the prospect of playing her and what you expect .
her game , petra kvitova struggled with it , karolina pliskova struggled with it , the softpaced balls . obviously against opponents like that you 're experienced . what is the mentality and game plan ?
do you feel like things feel simpler right now in your head or in your game compared to maybe a month ago on court ?
what were you confused about ? what was clouding your brain a little bit back then ?
fighting for this spot to singapore has to be the last big push of your season . how does it feel to fight for a place in the wta finals ?
how is it going with sam since you started your collaboration ? do you find it interesting ? do you feel it was what you were needing at this point in the season and your career ?
are you playing doubles today ?
you are also a good doubles players . how do you balance them ?
just a question about how your game has evolved over time . when you first started playing tennis when you were very , very young , why did you play the way that you did ? you have a very powerful game . other players might play with more variety . yours is kind of driven with power . why do you play that way , that style ?
was it difficult because you were in kind of the spanish style , and the coaches obviously know the spanish game , to find a coach that could help you play the more powerful style ?
do you think the game you have now , that it 's your personality , this is the game you like to play , as opposed to the game you have to play because your body is stronger ? do you wish you played the more spanish style or do you think , this is me ?
how much has the feedback changed around you from your country , other players , after wimbledon ? was it tough to adjust that you 're not an outsider anymore , people want to beat you , they 're not looking at you the same way ?
that was such a good fight from your side , and venus too . what is the dominating feeling ? disappointment ? or maybe satisfied because it was a really good level ?
you said you grew up watching her play tennis . was it weird to be on the same court at times ?
can you talk about the game , trying to serve out the match . do you think that was an instance where nerves got the best of you ? do you think she stepped up and played a particularly good return game ?
it looked like she played some of her best defense in that last few games .
just talk about that a little bit . were you pretty surprised after such a lengthy , physical match ? looked like it was difficult to hit through her .
what are the rest of your plans for the year ? you 're not in beijing quallies . are you headed back ? will you stay here and play tournaments in asia ?
from the very beginning , did you have a hunch or feeling that tonight was going to be quite a long battle ?
do you take anything special out of this week about your game , where you 're at , the next step ?
after these results , both in new york and now here , everything you did over the summer , is it frustrating at all to have to go back and play quallies every week ?
how do you rate your game indoors as we look forward to the european indoor season , as it were ? you 're comfortable on an indoor court ? you like the speed ?
we all know from the us open you always have a good plan . do you have some secrets to keep at a high level ?
what did you do to celebrate your first grand slam runnerup after the us open ?
girls relationship are always complicated , especially the friendship . you italian player girls are always a group . how did you make it ?
on today 's match , how did you feel the match went ? how do you feel petra was ? she seemed quite tired .
with that win over serena , now beating petra , it seems like you have right now a pretty good ability to take down the big hitters , the most aggressive players . what is the secret there ? what is the game plan you take with you when you play these players ?
do you feel like that confidence helped you through the fatigue ?
this section of the season , with asia , potentially singapore and zhuhai down the road ...
but is it easier for you to approach this portion of the season this year after what happened in new york or is it more difficult ?
can you give us an example of what it was like back home in italy when you came home .
your interview after the us open semifinal , some social media say it 's a funny interview . so i wonder , what is your character off the court ?
i think you are funny people .
such a breakthrough after the us open , flavia had such a long vacation . you come to asia to play a lot of matches . how did you celebrate it ? have dinner with your family ? how did you celebrate such a win ?
after the us open , flavia said that she was tired at the end of the season . have you ever thought the same thing after you accomplished such a great success and fame ? retiring , have you thought about that ?
you play tennis for such a long time . how do you keep your motivation on the court ?
difficult start , then like 'wow ' . you must be pleased with your match today .
it seems that quite a lot of the players are battling with tiredness at this point in the season . how are you dealing with that , keeping motivated ?
do you feel that singapore feels a bit closer now after today 's performance ?
after the first set , what do you think kind of clicked in your game ? your level in the second and third sets was incredibly high . what happened to change the match around for you ?
after your match against sloane , you said it did n't relax you , but that it reminded you you still had that quality . is this another instance of that , reaffirming that you can still play at the level you expect ?
a quick question about doubles . quite a few elite players , once they break into the top 10 , decide no more doubles , they just want to focus on singles . talk a little bit about your partnership with carla because you 're two top10 players who continue to play together , and whether you think doubles will continue to be an aspect of your career , or will you assess it after the season ?
with sam , after a match like you had against sloane , then the match you had today , what does he typically tell you after that ? what is the message you 're hearing from him with these positive performances ?
you have a doubles match to play . it 's raining . what are you going to do ?
after the match you seemed to be very excited . could you share your feelings with us right now . and second question is , what would you do if it rains the whole afternoon ?
go shopping maybe ?
it 's a very personal question . during the match , the referee said some chinese words like 'quiet ' and 'thank you ' . are you speaking a few chinese words ?
we noticed that today , the second set , you were being very aggressive and positive ; it seems more aggressive and more positive than ever before . is this because this is the end of the season so maybe you are going to try some new solid strategies ?
so in the match you were leading in the beginning , but then your opponent won . is it because of some physical reasons ? and what are your plans now ?
how much do you think yesterday 's match maybe influenced today 's match ? did you feel fresh enough on the court ?
when your coach is coming to the chair to talk to you , you have many exchanges . what can he tell you in these moments to bring you back into the match ?
speaking of david , how has your coaching relationship with him changed over time ? obviously he 's coached you for a very long time . is it more equal now than maybe before in terms of your dynamic ?
from 19 until now , what 's the biggest thing that he 's been able to do for you as a coach ?
with roberta , she obviously had the big win against serena , now this win today against you . is she one of those players on the tour that , when she 's playing well , is kind of a nightmare for players like you and serena that like to hit a big ball and try to be offensive ?
so thoughts after that match and just how you were able to turn around that third set .
did your mindset change at all tactically in that third set once you were down 15 ? it looked like you were trying to grip and rip a little bit more , trying to impose yourself . i do n't know if that was conscious thing at all .
any thoughts on tomorrow , meeting venus ?
i know it 's right after the match , but beating the world no.2 has to be something a bit special , no ?
these results you 're having since this summer , people are wondering how come did n't it happen before earlier . what kind of reason to see to that ?
against a player like simona , obviously the first time you played her .
when you talk about controlling only what you can control , what could you control against her and what could n't you control , if that makes sense ?
earlier this week you were talking about that concept of acceptance and tolerance and things like that , but also that it was a work in progress .
do you remember the last time that you played a match where you really struggled with that , accepting there were things you could n't control ?
in terms of on court , your demeanor is fairly calm . you do n't get too amped one way or the other . is that how it always has been ? if we were to go back and pull junior tapes ...
i guess when you came back at one set all , leading the third set , surely you were feeling better and better and maybe close to the win . how did it turn against you at the end ? you seemed in control since the second set .
you never faced her before . is her game surprising , the power she has ? was it tough to adjust ?
what specifically did she maybe impress you with ? movement , shots , power ? what was special about her game ?
you played on that court last night when the roof was open . today it was closed . were the conditions different ?
how were the conditions different ?
you 've had quite a packed schedule of tournaments lately . do you think that 's taken a toll on you in terms of your tiredness ?
do you think the number of tournaments you 've played have taken a toll on your tiredness ?
i would like to know are you making big decisions in big matches , do you feel you will have the right guess in the toss ?
right guess or right answer .
how frustrated are you ?
explain why .
maria gave up the china open . i remember in guangzhou you lost . so in china the three matches were not very easy . is there any upset on the china open or will that influence the wta final in singapore ?
you lost several matches like today this year . madrid or rome , i ca n't remember , to navarro , then birmingham and wimbledon . you lost like this style . why ? can you tell me why ?
i mean three sets , very close .
can you talk about the third set . and what is your next plan ?
you did n't look like you were feeling well in the second set . was it a leg injury ?
is the frustration just from losing this specific match from a micro level or is there a broader frustration of the niggles here and there , illnesses and things like that kind of derailing your season ?
did you feel okay when you woke up this morning ? did it come in the middle of the match ? was something going on before ?
the doctor came out and took your temperature . did you have a fever or anything else ?
talk about anna karolina 's game a little bit . what did you think you could exploit out there ?
do you think it can also come from the fact that it 's the end of the season , the body is tired , or is it bad luck that you caught something ?
talk a little bit about stacey allaster , her decision to step down , being a player under her tenure , what her legacy will be .
slightly off topic . do you remember the first time that you came to china ?
can you describe it ?
on the topic of friendships and things like that on tour . curious , over the course of your career , how has that changed your perspective ? i know you get asked this quite a bit . how has that changed in the locker room from your perspective in terms of how collegial it is on a whole and maybe just for yourself ?
i was going to ask about the junior relationships . do you think those friendships that you forged from those younger days are stronger or more important , or are they more difficult to maintain over time ?
congratulations on your 700th career win . how does it feel ?
how much do these sorts of milestones still mean to you ? do you care , do you not ?
did you ever think you 'd be in wuhan , china , at some point in your career , maybe back 10 , 15 years ago ?
what 's your thoughts on the facilities here , what you 've been able to see while you 've been in town ?
you mentioned your potential 800th win . what continues to motivate you ?
next year , anything particular on the horizon that 's exciting you ? the olympics ?
could you talk a little bit about stacey allaster , her decision to step down . you 've obviously known a bunch of different wta ceos . what has been her legacy and what 's it been like to work with her ?
talking about the facilities here and the fantastic new stadium they 've built , do you take it as another good sign for women 's tennis future , too ?
i would like to know your dress , your clothes , is it designed especially for the wuhan open ? it goes with your hairstyle . your hairstyle is also very special .
that must have felt pretty good , that performance . talk through the match a little bit , how you feel afterwards .
my assessment is that you 've been playing a little bit nervous through the summer up till now . does a performance like today , being able to play at that level , does that maybe relax you a little bit ?
can you talk through the coaching change and working with sam a little bit . what has that been like ? does it feel different ? what have you been working on ?
can you say stylistically how is he a different coach , how have your practices been a little bit different ?
can you tell us why you chose sam as a coach ?
he had a lot of success with vika , but not so much with eugenie .
do you remember the first time you came to china ?
can you tell me about it .
how different is it culturally for you to be here ?
what is your mentality going into the rest of this season ? does singapore , the potential of possibly qualifying , help you through this section of the season ? what is your take on it ?
what do you do to prepare for your next match against ana ivanovic ?
do you know her ?
you looked so tired in the third set . were you surprised you pulled it off ?
for the recovery , do you think it could be an issue for tomorrow ? do you think your body can get used to this ?
when you are feeling like you 're getting tired , what do you tell yourself ? what is your reaction ? are you thinking , oh , no , here we go again , or that it 's okay , keep going ?
we talk a lot about practice , how you 've changed that aspect of your game since the diagnosis . but recoverywise , what you do after matches , has that changed at all ?
quite a few players have come in here talking about this section of the season , with asia , singapore , fed cup . for you mentally , how do you approach this last few weeks of the season ?
next round you face vinci . as a us open finalist she 's in good form . how will you deal with her ?
it was a pretty entertaining match to watch today from outside . how is gavrilova as a player ? she is bouncing on the court . do you feel that vibe on the other side ?
another threeset match for you . talk about the match a little bit , how you were able to pull it out in three sets , and also what you thought about the court , how it 's playing .
the way that the stadium is built , because it has not a full roof , it 's a little bit closed at the top , does it sound different out there ? does it feel different compared to other outdoor hard courts that you play on during the season ?
is it a moment of the season when you start to feel all the matches you 've played in the legs , and it 's like , one more month , two more months , or do you still feel fresh enough ?
you said you played a lot of amazing matches this year , in us open against azarenka , and in stuttgart against maria sharapova . last night maria retired because of her injury . because you 're in the bottom part of the draw , do you think it 's your chance to win the wuhan open here ?
over the course of the last four years since you 've made the breakthrough , become a top10 player , now with a little bit more perspective , when you look back , what was the moment where you kind of believed that you were an elite player ?
or are you still waiting ?
when you believe that , when you start to understand you 're an elite player , how does that change you ? how does that change how you approach matches or your career ? or did it change you at all ?
when you look back , is there a match that stands out to you ? we talk to players and ask , what is your biggest win ? what do you consider yours ?
your match against azarenka in new york was amazing . many people were talking about it during the tournament and still since the tournament . have some players come to you and talked to you about it ?
we notice in the beginning there were ups and downs , some breakpoints , but you made adjustments very quickly . is it because you feel uncomfortable in the new stadium or are there any other reasons ?
last year in wuhan , the performance was not very good . after today 's match , we saw a lot of strong players left the wuhan open . will that mean you will be more motivated to expect the title ?
do you use this section of the season at all to just practice certain things that you want to improve in your game , seeing as how you already qualified for singapore , or are you just out here trying to win tournaments and matches ?
some of the best players , the elite players , over the course of the last five , ten years , they 've always been able to continue to improve their games , like li na or serena , maria , they 've changed their games a lot . when you look at your game , what do you see as something you want to add , how you see your game evolving ?
how hard is it at this point in the season to not think about holidays ?
are you more of a beach holiday or mountains ?
what do you expect in the next match against konta ? is she a tough player to get around because of the serve or the way she 's playing ?
when you said you used last week to practice to improve your net game , is it easy to start doing something new at this stage of the season ?
i watched a lot of games on the center court . today 's match , i felt you had a lot of strategy and you played solid . it seemed perfect to me . i would like to know are you satisfied with your condition now and do you feel you will have the title in the end ?
can you just talk about the decision to retire , the nature of the injury .
was the leg injury something sustained during training and practice before you got here ?
on court we could see you were obviously frustrated with the situation . can you articulate i guess exactly what you 're frustrated with ? i 'm at a tournament , i ca n't play the best i want to play . is it what 's happened this season ? what exactly was the frustration ?
genie bouchard a couple months ago said , yes , these experiences are learning experiences , but i 'm kind of sick of learning . i 'd like to get over it and move on . can you relate to that a little bit ?
when you talk about thinking towards next season , i assume you mean the offseason and the work you want to put in ?
do you think next year you might balance your schedule a little bit differently to allow yourself more time to recover ?
have you then talked with wim and sascha about having a more extended offseason training block or have they not happened yet ?
in the discussions with your team about what you need to do in the offseason , is it about establishing a fitness base , or are you concerned about inmatch fitness ?
not always the best way for a match to end . can you talk about the first two sets at least , how you thought you played for the match .
did you change anything in the second set tactically or improve in your game or did you notice something happening on her side ?
what do you think was the difference between the first tiebreaker and the second tiebreaker ?
against a player like her , what is the game plan ? what is the key to beating maria ?
since this is in china , we have to talk about our greatest tennis idol , li na . we all know that before her retirement you are the one ...
do you remember that match ?
yes .
can you just talk about the injury , when you felt it first , how is it feeling ? why did you make the decision to retire ?
do you chalk it up to that , being your first match back since wimbledon ? did you have any sense at all there was anything going on with your arm going into the match ?
you 've had your fair share of injuries . is today like the last straw ?
do you already know what the plan is now ? going back to the states or to beijing ?
how were you feeling in the first set ? what would you say about your opponent today ?
i 've noticed that when you sat down , you used your left arm to support your body . did you feel any discomfort with your left arm ?
setting aside the second and third sets , talking about that first set , did you feel the rust come up most during the pressure points ? you had the set points at 53. is that one of those you ca n't practice those sorts of points in practice ?
i would like to know , a lot of the spectators came to the stadium just for you , but you quit the game and people were quite sad . next year if your body allows you , will you be here again ?
just now the question was that many fans came here because of you . what would you tell the fans in wuhan ?
the first two sets are very tough . you played very well in the third set , especially in the last game . would you talk about it .
we know that you took the highspeed railway from guangzhou to wuhan . what is your feeling ?
what do you think about the way the court is playing , the speed and the bounce ? also , is the leg an injury or is it just sore ?
you 're facing kerber next . great battle coming .
it seems like the fans in china are really into your game , your personality . do you feel like you 're more liked here than other parts of the world ?
i want to ask you , the next year , brazil olympic games , i wish you can play on behalf of serbia , play olympic games .
in ghangzou and this time in wuhan , you lose both of the games . is there any reason for this ?
so after li na 's retirement and soon zheng jie and peng shuai will be retired . why do we not have any further strong players ? as a good player , what is the reason , in your opinion ?
just now you mentioned that today the notsogood performance is because of the mental pressure . why do you have such a pressure ? is it because you are here in wuhan ? where does the pressure come from ?
i have heard talk about you and errani in ghangzou . they say you were being too aggressive , and it was not a good strategy . why ?
in the tennis field , it 's very important for the cooperation between the coach and the player . if the coach can not help the player anymore , there 's no new strategy , maybe the players need to think about changing coaches . maybe chinese people tend to favor the familiar things and do n't want to change . i want to know your cooperation between you and your coach . do you still want to cooperate with him in the future ? are there any changes in the works ?
we can see in the advertisement of the wuhan open , you 're in a very important position . is there any pressure because of this ?
actually we can see that before ghangzou , you were in good condition . but now your performance is not as good as before . is it very difficult to maintain your form ?
we 've discussed the issue for a long time , the top female player in china , li na , had this pressure before . so as with peng shuai and zheng jie . now you 're the top female player in china . what are your thoughts on this ?
to be in a toplevel game playing against these professional players . it 's a rare occasion . why do you think you lost this game ?
so before this game , do you know the singles in the wuhan open , you are the only one left ?
why do you think you got the wild card when you are lower than other players ?
three years ago in shenzhen , we talked a lot . i have this feeling that you 're very motivated compared with players at your same age . how do you view your progress in recent years ?
you are transforming yourself , competing more in the wta tournaments . what 's the difference between the itf and wta ?
so the gap you mentioned , is it because of the selfdiscipline or is it because of the personalities ? what is the reason ?
for toplevel competitions , there would be different arrangements . talk about your position , for example .
i know that this year you 're only 19. this is maybe the first year of your professional career . there is still a long way ahead of you . is there any plan for your future career , like at what age , what kind of achievements would you have ? will you always try your best and see whatever stage you can achieve ? if you have a plan , do you have a goal for different steps ?
i saw that you tied your leg in the match . how is the injury now ?
you 're the first player i 've spoken to that 's actually played on the new court . how did you find it generally ?
after the us open , how long did you leave the racquets in the bag ? when did you start getting ready for the asian swing ?
you are playing johanna konta next . are you worried about this injury ?
do you remember the first time that you came to china ?
what did you think when you stepped off the plane , on the bus coming in ? what are your memories coming here ?
you actually were there in the stadium ?
big news with stacey allaster stepping down . what are your thoughts on that decision ? any memories or anything that you have of working with her ?
we can see you are not in good form this year because you never got a title . as a former world no.1 and grand slam champion , have you ever experienced a great struggle ?
this year you have never won a title .
you achieved the australian open in 2003 [ sic ] . after your injury , you underwent quite a long not good form . have you ever experienced a struggle like this year ?
yes . i just watched your match in this stadium .
i want to ask about one personal question . some people are saying that you 're gaining weight . is there any response towards this ? are you on a diet or plan to lose weight ?
did you think you would manage to turn it around at the end there ?
was it a back problem in the end of the second set ?
what 's the general emotion or feeling for you right now after that match ?
you have played the most matches on the wta so far .
is there any thought of , thinking about your schedule moving ahead , to make sure you rest ?
during the offseason , you had a very short break , so is that ...
why did you choose to come to dubai for vacation ?
when you were here , did you do anything tennis or it was totally vacation ?
monday you will be no.12 in the world and we are not even in march yet . how do you feel to accomplish that so early in the season ?
what do you think you can take as positives out of this ? because you have played against a top 5 player , you have matched her , you know you can do it . if you were to take something out for the rest of the season , what would this be ?
you have the wta tournament in prague . how important is that to you for you to be there ?
you 're no.4 in the world to singapore now . do you have an eye to be ...
how much of a mind game was this match for you tonight ?
do you think you 've come up so fast these last few weeks , the high 18 , now 12 , do you think you 're going to have to learn how to think of yourself as a top player as opposed to somebody looking to get there ?
tell us how you feel .
very tough to finish off the match , was n't it ?
that was the confidence boost you needed ?
how can you come to a tournament not in good form and finish it in very good form ? what are the processes you go through ?
did it also help you to escape against makarova from close to defeat ?
why do you think you were able to fight this week and not in australia ?
talk a little bit about the crowd .
have you been in many tournaments outside of romania with as many fans ?
i saw a lot of tweets the past few days saying that you breathe life into romanian tennis . your fans are saying that . is that how you feel ?
how does it feel to win as the top seed here ? obviously it may be a new development for you to live up to that billing ?
i saw you yesterday having a big dinner with a lot of people . friends and family ?
dos it help to have all these people with you at the tournament ?
first point to the last , to my mind the best match was when you played against makarova . do you agree or not ?
when i saw your match against makarova , you were very concentrated but i did not see this when you play against wozniacki . how can you explain ?
what does it take to improve your performance , in the grand slams , your headtohead results with the likes of serena ?
how do you plan to improve your results
in the current year and matches .
what are you going to do about it ?
some players buy themselves a present or something after a big win or something . are you one ? if so , what do you have in mind ?
buy a house ?
that 's a big present .
you mentioned you had some physical problems . how are you feeling now ?
anything specific ? we heard your hip or something .
any thought on maybe skipping doha or not ?
discouraged or frustrated or both ?
kind of the week of illness finally caught up with you , do you think ?
you 're going to doha next ?
initially you were n't , right ? you got a wildcard . any reason why you were n't going to play it and change your mind ?
what kind of medication have you been on ? serious stuff or just chemist , pharmacy stuff ?
you rattle now , do you ?
i told you it should have been whiskey .
you keep coming back to see us with a smile on your face .
how did you turn that match around after the first set ?
you said before the tournament that you were a little bit low on confidence . is it fair to say that you are feeling more confident now heading into the final ?
karolina pliskova says she remembered you played a very long time ago when you were kids and it went to 14 or it was like an eighthour match .
well , we know she 's got a very big serve . does that put pressure on you to hold your own serve ?
how do you find the conditions out there ? i do n't think it was quite as windy as it was earlier , was it ?
you mentioned that she 's taller than you .
most players are taller than you . what makes a little girl want to take up tennis when she sees all these big girls playing ? what made you think you can compete with them ?
did you used to focus on the height of your opponents when you were younger ?
in the stands there has been a specific woman every day .
have you met her ?
do you know her personally ?
is she romanian ?
did you realize there were so many romanians over here ?
now the weeks in dubai and doha will alternate , premier and premier 5. you won in doha last year . it was a premier 5. do you think coming here you need to try and make points and not lose points or these kind of things or you do n't think about it ?
do you ever think about the dollars you 're earning ?
about the dollars you 're earning .
how are you feeling ?
once you got on top of her today , you got on top of her .
simona next . your thoughts ?
you seemed to be making good progress , and yet you asked for your dad twice . what keys could he add in those situations ?
we thought you were giving your order for dinner .
are you pleased you got that second set pretty quickly ?
has it helped you focus even more ?
the knee , which you said has been around for a while , is that just wear and tear ? might marathon running have had anything to do with it ?
would doing a marathon again be something you 'd be interested in or too hard of work ?
was it just something sort of at the time or to run triathlons ? are you a good enough swimmer for that ?
have you done a run of any length since doing the marathon ?
no , no , no , just going out for ...
what was it like , the atmosphere in newyork ?
she 's tough to play , is n't she ?
what is it about dubai ? this is your seventh time . round 1 , round 2 i think four times , round 2 ?
what would be goals for this year ?
is it positive , moving on from here ?
you had a very good year last year . do you feel any pressure at all to try and at least match that or improve on it ?
will going into wimbledon this year be a burden on what you did last year ?
you say that you are a great admirer of angelina jolie ?
you have played here now several times . what do you like about being in dubai ?
does having a hotel so close make it more special than other tournaments ?
what was the difference between the match in australia and the match tonight ? because that match in australia was just 4 and love . this was different .
why do you feel it was going up and down ? first you , then her , then back again ?
were you wondering when you were going to finally convert one of those match points ?
how frustrating was it when you did n't serve out the match ?
when you were serving for the match .
if you were to take any positives out of today for the rest of the season , what would this be ?
that must have felt good .
are you feeling any better ?
you just were in bed all day , were you ?
as long as you 're winning matches , is this a new sort of regime ?
you went on court knowing there were so many upsets , i assume ? did it make you a little nervous or you do n't think about it ?
any plan you came with to meet with her ?
tomorrow should be a good match , should n't it ?
obviously you seemed a little upset when you had lost your serve , whatever . your dad came out on the court . what did he tell you ? how did you turn it around ?
when you are expecting long rallies tomorrow and with the condition of your health , it 's not ideal .
you appeared to be taking something out there on court . is it just sort of throat lozenges ?
whiskey is good for that .
if you felt so awful today , was there ever a thought of not playing or pulling out ?
what are your thoughts on that ?
how tough are the conditions out there ? seems like today is particularly hot .
you were the only player who had a day off . everyone else played . does that affect your rhythm at all ?
when you 've got a winning streak like you had here , which is the best by far of anyone else who has played here , does that play on your mind at all ? do you want to keep it going ?
you would have gotten back to the top 10 to defend the title here . your plans regarding that ? you 're playing doha , right ?
will you stay here for a few more days or go straight there ?
have you set yourself any targets for this year ?
i think you probably addressed this in the round tables , but can i just clear up , you 're not playing indian wells whereas your sister is ?
is that purely a decision that you need to rest after an arduous round of tournaments ?
did they ask you to play indian wells ?
when did serena tell you she made that decision ? did she ask your opinion ? what 's your thoughts on her decision to play ?
can you understand why after all this time ? bygones be bygones and why not ?
can you see yourself playing there in the future , maybe next year ?
do you like more to play indoors or outdoors ?
i saw you last time in press conference in russia , kremlin cup . it was many , many years ago . you were there with your sister . it was indoors . that 's why i ask you . it 's so hot , if you compare the climates , this one . do you prefer to play indoors or outdoors ? what will be the better ?
no difference ?
is there any difference because they obviously swapped these . we are used to going to doha and then dubai . do you sense any difference , or is it ...
did you get around in dubai this time , do anything you have n't done before ?
i see those mall visits in your future .
you always said that your mood is reflected in the clothes you design , your shoes . your 35th year in june . have you any special plans in your design for wimbledon perhaps with your clothing ?
designed for the fall of 2016 ?
would you ever be thinking a year from now i do n't like that style anymore but i already prepared it ?
did you wear the design anyway ?
can you tell us which one ?
the most recent one ?
dare we ask if you made a design in case you play the wta finals in singapore ?
she says you always give her a hard time .
yesterday you played almost three hours .
then doubles . and today in this heat . how do you explain ...
what do you think you do in particular that bothers her ?
this is your first quarterfinal in dubai .
she had like 16 consecutive wins here . when you step on the court , does that play in your mind at all ?
i did n't get to see your whole match yesterday . were there any match points against you ?
does that give you extra confidence when you win a tiring match like that ?
you have either ana ivanovic next or karolina pliskova . can you talk about both of those players ?
a lot of them .
winning a grand slam doubles last month , does that really boost your confidence for singles ?
karolina obviously served your country well in fed cup in quebec . first time out she won her matches .
did you talk to her at all in antwerp about that experience ?
i was there .
is it your plan to play in the semis or you do n't know yet ? fed cup ?
i think i saw a match against serena earlier in the year where you ran her really close . obviously you beat venus here . what is it about the williams sisters which ...
you were close .
last time out . what is it about them that seemingly brings the best out in you , would you say ?
what are your thoughts on that ?
how difficult was it to play in such hot conditions for the second day running ? you were first on again at midday .
did you think of asking for an evening match ?
how are you feeling ?
how come martina could n't come this week ?
is she supposed to go every place with you or just cherrypick certain tournaments ?
it looked as if you enjoyed that out there today .
what do you think you did particularly well ?
when you come in to a tournament with so many top players , do you realistically think you have a chance of winning the final ?
how much confidence do you take from beating someone like aga , a top seed in this tournament , going forward ?
are you feeling at this point your career is moving along how you wanted it to , like you 're where you anticipated being at this point in time ?
did you ever live in venezuela , or your mother is just venezuelan ? what 's the deal ?
and your family is where now , spain ?
you 're kind of a citizen of both ?
you 're like a citizen of venezuela and citizen of spain ?
what 's your passport ?
have you had a chance to look around dubai ? have you done anything ?
how do you like the tournament ?
what do you think you need to improve in your game to move to the next level ?
regular ? you mean consistent ?
what do you like to do away from tennis ?
when did you decide to play tennis ?
where did you start ?
why did you start playing tennis ? did your family play or you saw people play ?
you got back into the match , and in the end it seemed very small differences . what do you think made the difference in the end ?
were you nervous ? you hit a double fault , and that was right before you got broken . was that nerves or ...
you kind of started in the heat , but i think it probably cooled down some a little bit after . how was it ?
you have had difficult matches with her . what makes her game tough to deal with ?
so many seeds lost today . aga , ana , you , venus . the only top 8 seed to win today is makarova . why do you think it is ? is it difficult to come to dubai and do so well because of conditions ? what do you think ?
are you getting the sense that the gap is closing between the other players ? is it happening more now than before ?
what 's next for you ?
what are your thoughts on that ?
what makes her difficult ? she seems to really be picking up now .
it 's very hot this month in dubai , even more than usual . i think it was 41 degrees at one point today . can you explain what it 's like playing in that type of temperature ?
aga and venus both lost before you as top seeds . when you 're preparing and in the buildup for your preparations , does that sort of unnerve a seed seeing fellow seeded players lose ?
in those crucial moments , crucial points towards the end of the match , is it really just a matter of confidence ?
you had mentioned before the tournament that you wanted to focus on the bigger events more . in light of this loss , are you disappointed or are you happy with the way ...
how was the toe today ?
you 're going to doha ?
why that kind of schedule ? it would seem more like , you know , direct to go to doha .
so when you were seeing all those seeds getting upset , does it go through your head when you were going on the court at all ? like venus lost ...
did you know they had all lost before you took the court ?
it looked like a comfortable match but not an easy one for you .
after the australian open , did you go back to that quarterfinal with makarova and analyze what went wrong there ? you 're playing her next .
you have had the benefit of playing at night .
when you prepare for a match and you 're with your coach , do you watch lots of videos and you then discuss with your coach ?
so what do you do to prepare for a match , say , against makarova tomorrow ?
what about your input with your coach ?
yeah . he 's telling you what to do , but do you actually say , well , do n't you think i should be doing this as well ?
i remember last year in doha you had quite a lot of romanian fans in the stands . today as well . they are saying it 's one of the bestattended wednesday match .
does it surprise you that you 're in the middle east and you have all this following ?
how often do you have to serve for a match three times before you get the job done ?
can you tell us what 's wrong with your leg ?
is it the knee ?
what do you think made it difficult for you to close it out ? was it more her or you ?
what else is going on here ?
you play every day .
you have had some very close matches against sam . why is it always difficult in a sense of both of you when you play each other ?
you get to play cornet in the next match . she did well here last year . she 's sometimes a player that explodes on the court and talks to the umpires . when you play a player like that , do you go in wary of that ?
when did this develop ? you sounded okay on saturday .
do you enjoy facing someone with sam 's style ? it 's maybe similar to yourself , your style of play . do you enjoy playing that , or do you get a kick out of playing someone different ?
you mentioned before that no matter the draw , you 're playing someone tough earlier or later , it does n't matter . will it give you a certain type of confidence now moving forward that you went through that kind of match ?
when you 're not feeling great and you know you 're playing tomorrow , would you go and ask to try and play later in the day , or ...
thanks for coming straight in . would we be right in thinking you 're not that well ?
did you think you may not have been able to finish at one stage ?
what was difficult ? breathing or ...
you sound pretty congested . is it just the nose or is there fever , as well ?
have you been able to practice , or were you resting more the last couple of days ?
you play muguruza next . what are your feelings about playing her ?
looks like fed cup has meant so many people are so tired and sick and they went to different continents in very small time . venus yesterday was telling us that perhaps it should be done in a different way . do you agree ?
do you think it 's wrong to play davis cup and fed cup so soon after a slam ?
it wo n't encourage the top players to ...
we saw you in australia obviously with martina . she 's not here . how does the relationship/partnership work when she 's not here ?
on the phone , text ?
so you 'll speak in a couple of hours ? well , she 's in the states . it will be more than a couple of hours ?
you will speak before the next match ?
can i just ask the significance of that yellow ribbon around your wrist ?
the ribbon is part of the jewelry ?
you said it was going to be a tough match and it was . what did she do in the first set that troubled you , and how did you turn it around ?
what 's it going to be against carla ?
court 1. does it make a difference for you that today you played on center ; tomorrow it 's on another court ?
third match .
did you feel in the first set that maybe you were trying to rush , like rush really good points ? then obviously in the second and third it was maybe more ...
you mentioned your match with carla last year . it was 76 in the third . it was really tight . does any of the stuff creep in your mind when you find yourself in an opening match here in a threesetter ?
barring that last break at the end , that seemed like a perfect match from your end . how did you feel about it ?
she had 16 aces in her first match but she had 0 this time . was that more you and your return game , or did you sense she was n't serving well ?
how did you feel with the heat out there ? did it affect your play ?
what 's the secret to keeping a good focus like that ?
how did you feel with your toe today ? did it hamper you in any way ?
you looked so positive out there . you really appear to be i can remember sitting here and watching you three years ago when nigel was with you and you were uncertain . out there you just seemed straight down the middle .
karolina pliskova next match . talk about that match .
is there a sense of wanting to make up for lost time ?
in your career .
but , you know , you were no.1 . you won the french open . then things went down . they have been coming back gradually . do you view those as lost years , or do you view them ...
you said you had n't played for a month . what did you do during that month ?
was that switzerland ?
do you sense a lot of people want you to make this recovery ?
you mentioned being in the public eye . over the past year in particular it seems that you have embraced more being in the spotlight than perhaps in the past . is that a fair assessment ?
how difficult is it to focus against a player who obviously is not playing at her very best ?
i was wondering , how are your ribs feeling ? i heard they might be hurting a little bit ?
a 3love record against daniela . what is it about her game that suits your style ?
what do you like about being in dubai ?
as you said , you have n't played that many matches here in the past . are you comfortable on center court here in these conditions ?
that was okay , was n't it ?
you 've been improving , as well ?
tell us about the improvement .
the way you were hitting tonight , how does that compare to , say , five or six years ago ?
she 's half your age . do you just even think about that at all , or like , hey , i just beat this girl ? she 's 17 ? and a protg of martina hingis ?
when a player gets to over 30 , they have to make some kind of compromise somewhere usually in the way they practice and prepare . what have you done ?
but how do you maintain such terrific athleticism ?
do you think any of this saving of energy has to do with the fact that you guys did n't play juniors and like , you know , that kind of thing ?
can you compare the enjoyment levels of 17yearold venus williams beating bigtime players and 34yearold venus williams beating younger players ?
you must feel that you have been something of a trailblazer in raising the level of the game for youngsters .
are you aware of daniela hantuchova 's story in the last 24 hours ?
she played a final in pattaya yesterday .
traveled straight here overnight , maybe got an hour of sleep everywhere until walking on court tonight and won .
you have had quite a sort of hectic travel schedule .
how do you guys do it , seriously ?
would you like to see it the way it used to be ?
other players come here first round and they struggle with the change in temperature , courts , ball , everything . you , in the first set today , were hitting the ball so clean . how do you explain that and how did you manage to be so ready for this tournament ?
you hit with omar behroozian , he 's a local guy from here , for a few days . can you talk about that ? it 's not every day someone from here gets this kind of experience .
i know you are a world teamtennis person . i know you 're not playing indian wells , but they will have the 40th anniversary party for that . will you go out for that ?
have you told billie ?
we are concerned about you . can you explain what your problem is ?
what have the medical staff told you about that discomfort ? they said it could be a result of ...
silly question probably , but you 're not using orthotics in your shoes or anything ?
are you given any sort of medical guidelines on how many antiinflammatories , so forth , you should take ?
is it a matter of rest for you now or are you going to start back playing again ?
we always ask you this , but could it be connected to the glandular fever ?
what have been your global movements since fed cup ? where did you go ?
tenniswise , do you feel any concern ? because you have had such a fantastic junior career . do you feel you 've lived up to the potential that you were supposed to ?
can you say what these things are , what you can do better ?
you have had a bit of a rough time healthwise with glandular fever , what happened in australia , now obviously here . do you think that if you were to take time out or took time away from the game to get yourself fully healthy and then you came back , would that be something you would consider from here ?
laura has had to pull out for her projected comeback .
next week . have you had much dialogue with her ? you have been struggling with health things . she 's been struggling with injury things . it 's been unfortunate .
she 's quite a bouncy character .
you know her as well as anybody . is she still up ?
did you hit together in florida or work out together ?
we were told she was hitting .
when was this ? i 've got you now ( smiling ) .
so what do you girls talk about ?
what movies did you see ?
it must have made a big impression on you .
did you get a chance to hit with martina since she 's here ?
did you get a chance to talk to her in the locker room ?
anything about tennis ?
are you in the doubles here ?
and do you know when you 're playing ?
it was n't anything to do with the heat ? it was really hot out there .
so burning or cramping ?
talking about boys , do you like the same kind of boys ? are you going to fight over them ?
who is your taste of a young star ?
and laura ?
so fantastic last year . then last week was not exactly what you would have expected in bangkok ? what are your feelings like ?
the australian open fourth round was maria sharapova . is there anything that you learned from that match ?
now that li na is , you know , phasing out and you are among those who are supposed to take over , do you feel that you 're doing justice to this role that you have to play ?
you think you can do better ? you think you can do better than li na ?
li na .
so can you talk us through hour by hour your last 24 hours ? so you finished the match in pattaya , what , 5:00 ?
you could have done without three sets like this tonight ?
you said something about you got an hour 's sleep ? when was that ? after breakfast when you went to your room ?
you must be very proud of what you have achieved .
what kept you going in the third set ?
i 'm just curious , what did you do between melbourne in terms of travel between melbourne and pattaya ?
you 've got a tough one again tomorrow night .
we are making the assumption you flew in a more comfortable part of the airplane .
the players who made the final in antwerp were given something called a performance bye .
apparently it 's just for the premier tournaments and not the internationals . do you think that 's fair ? do you think it should be ...
do you drink a lot of coffee ?
are you going to sleep now ?
do you ever remember playing a match without having slept ?
you were facing match points and then everything changed . how did you turn it around ?
how did you keep yourself from crying and back to fighting mode ?
did you see her do something different when all those match points went away ? could you feel her go away , as well ?
talk about the conditions . you faced 19 break points today . so was it difficult on serving in these conditions ?
now that you had over two hours you spent on court , do you think this will give you a bit of advantage going into the next match ?
you talked about last year you had a very good start to last year . you won a very big title . tennis changes really quickly .
how do you deal with that ?
is this a late valentine 's day gift ?
how long do you think till you reach your ...
tenth appearance in dubai .
well done today . congratulations . an eighth title . how does it feel ?
how does it compare to the other seven ?
i notice that you 've been through so much these last few weeks with the knee pain , not sure if you 're going to play or not . seemed like your celebration was a tad understated . was it because you beat her so badly , almost like c.c . earlier in the week ?
i know you dedicated this win to your dad . is he okay healthwise ? why would n't be here from palm beach ?
what are your thoughts looking forward to the clay court season in europe ?
on thursday you mentioned that you needed to get some rest and practice on your day off . did you practice something specifically that helped you play so well today , or was the rest the big thing ?
2001 was the last time anybody pulled of the australianfrench double ; that was jennifer . obviously it 's a tough thing to do . why do you think it 's so difficult ?
where are you playing between now and the french ?
and also , i think martina won 12 titles at one tournament , if i 'm not mistaken , in chicago . think you might get to 12 in miami ?
you indicated in some of your previous matches that you were unhappy with your serve and struggling with it . talk about how you felt about it today and where you are with that .
you 're sort of in uncharted waters : 33 , no.1 in the world for two years now , and just alluded to at some point it 's going to end . how far do you think you can keep dominating women 's tennis like this ? how much longer ?
she has one of the nicest onehanded topspin backhands in the game .
you seemed to take it away from her early . was that your plan , and did you think once you broke that down you kind of broke her spirit ?
did you go after it at all ?
you have n't lost this year . do you think this could be the year for the pure grand slam ?
is there a mantra or something you tell yourself when you need to kind of get refocused and build your confidence ? is there something you tell yourself , a mantra , something that keeps you pumped ?
do you feel you understand tennis better now than you did a few years ago in terms of patterns , play , everything else ? talk about that a little bit .
you and martina seem to be having a good time up there . what were you talking about ?
previously you have talked about how you like the vibe the and energy in miami . do you think that helped you in your semifinal run here ?
was there anything today about your opponent in the match this surprised you ?
( no microphone . )
when you say she is humble , what does that mean for you ? in what regard ?
carla has been playing really well all year . the surface here i 've been told is playing more slow , more like clay . can you comment some on the surface ? and also , your thoughts on how that might work in carla 's favor possibly tomorrow .
she 's back in the top 10 ; you would 've been too with this match . did that play on your mind at all ? and talk about the onehanded backhand . there are not that many that play with that style in the top 10. what does that mean for tennis ?
last thing : the fact that you do n't see it very often at the high level , does that make it harder to play ? you 're not used to it ? does that throw you off ?
hearing your team today , it was all idemos and ajdes . were they trying to get your serbian blood flowing ?
just your thoughts on the game . you almost got there , but did n't work out to your advantage at the end .
it was a really good fight . can we expect now to see more ? serena has n't had anyone that 's pushed her very hard all the time like you have the last few ones . can we expect more matches like this between you two ?
she 's won here seven times . the fans are very used to seeing her excel here . tonight it seemed pretty clear from the crowd that they were in your corner . the fans seemed to be behind you tonight . how much did that help you ? or did you even notice ?
i think the television suggested that at the end of the second set you did n't realize it was over .
watching the match from the side , looked like in the beginning of the match she was playing unbelievably well .
do you feel like you have a solution in a situation like that , or you have to wait for her to drop her level ?
there was a point where she hit a backhand lob over you . incredible point . backhand lob winner and you were running back and smiling .
why ?
serena said she 's a fan of yours , your tennis . how do you feel about her tennis ? are you a fan of her tennis and her ?
we talk a lot about serena 's serve , how fast it is or how powerful she is . some players say she 's a good player because she has really good defense or her serve is really tough to read . how do you explain or describe the strengths of her tennis ?
first quarterfinal here . first set was like a baseline war . talk about just the overall quality of that , the baseline battle you two had tonight .
talk about the second set . take me through it a little bit . the tiebreaker , what happened in the tiebreaker ?
can you kind of describe your feelings about getting to the quarterfinal ?
we do n't know yet .
i wo n't . but can you just kind of grab your feelings of getting there and what it means to you to make the quarterfinals of a tournament near your home ?
we talked to venus earlier . could you imaging 35 , almost 35 years old and still doing what she does ? you know , she started very young and here she is still at 35. can you sort of talk to what it must take to be where she is at her age ?
talk about the comfort level . nick is here ; you train at plantation . i imagine you 're sleeping in your apartment in fort lauderdale . does it lead up to the perfect storm for you , possibly ?
talk about your sense of accomplishment now . i know it 's just the quarterfinals , but you had some disappointing results last year . obviously the last three weeks have been wonderful . sense of accomplishment . nice little move this last month .
can you win this ?
you 're one of three new first timers in the quarterfinals here . just kind of what are your thoughts about the new , fresh faces advancing in this tournament now ?
first of all , it 's amazing how i 'm sitting here and there are just i was talking to my teacher and she 's comparing you to serena and venus . to just to be amongst those names , how do you deal with the pressure coming out and being on the big stage every day or weekend and just competing to your best ability ?
what kind of goal is that first title ? you must be starving for it . 22 now . you must be starving for it . how big would that be , getting that first one ?
you 're okay with that ?
that was kind of hard to watch . was it hard to play ?
what did you say to her at the net ?
it seemed like you were n't you love , i know , beating your opponents very soundly . it just seemed like you really did n't love it today . am i right ?
do you remember when you were really young and your first time against one of the biggest players in the world and what that felt like and what she may have been going through today on the other side ?
i saw this incredible documentary of you and venus . i 'm looking at your opponent today , and i 'm thinking back of everything that you guys have accomplished . so my question to you is : have you had time to think and sit there and think everything that you have accomplished and know the doors that you have opened for other players ?
well , because it was just a long question . i know we are in a different it 's just the first time i get to ask it since i have seen the documentary . congratulations , because i thought it was great .
before all this started , you tried to set expectations for yourself in terms of your knee injury . can you give us an update on that ?
we all talk about how special your serve is . have you ever thought about what it would be like to return your own serve , and what do you think makes your serve so special ?
as lopsided as it was today , could you see some potential in cc 's game ? what , if anything , impressed you to think she 's got room to really grow as a player ?
who was that against ?
you guys did n't play any juniors and it clearly worked for venus and you , yet it does n't seem like anyone decided that would be a smart idea to follow the williams family line in that respect . most of the players come through the juniors . does it surprise you at all that some of the juniors do n't skip the juniors ?
how much of a factor is it that venus and you had each other to play ?
did she pay you ?
when you were saying before that when it 's another young american across the court you kind of want to see her do well . in the few moments where she had an ace or she had a big point and the crowd cheered , was part of you happy for her ? i know you would never be happy for someone scoring a point against you , but in a match like today , is it different ?
a very upanddown match , particularly towards the end . in the second set there were like seven breaks . finally you were the one to get the seventh one . can you talk a little bit about that ?
it 's the first time you reached the fourth round here , i think . talk a little bit about i know you have been in the third round a couple of times , but miami and your feelings about the event , talk about that .
talk a little bit about i mean , being the champion at indian wells , whether it 's the men 's tour or the women 's tour , players have found it pretty difficult to play these two major events back to back and come out of both as a champion .
is it difficult because you 're just fatigued from having won , or you 're on such a high , and then to go and be like back in the first round again ?
azarenka or pennetta ; just talk about that next .
did you expect as much support as you had in the grandstand today ? giorgi is argentinian in part , being miami and a lot of south americans , seems like you were just ...
so can you try to describe for those of us who will never play serena on a center court what 's it like and to be your age and to be going up against serena williams on a center court ? what was it like ?
when you first walked out there and you see her , i mean , she 's an imposing figure , obviously . what was going through your mind at that moment when you first saw her , first got on the court ?
i 'm wondering , how about just the stadium itself ? i ca n't imagine you had ever played on anything like that . the us open you were probably on the outer courts , right ?
what was that like getting adjusted ?
the other thing was you did n't show what you had today really . i imagine when you go home and look at the tape , if you ever look at this again , you will say , how did i miss all those shots . talk about how you actually felt you played . not about serena , just about how you played .
how did that ace feel ? that got a big ovation .
were you ready to stop right then ?
how did the conversation at the net go afterwards ?
i 'm from england . have you ever played on grass ? what are your plans for this summer ?
so you played junior wimbledon ?
how did you find that in your game ? i guess it 's a pretty unusual experience where you 're from .
did anything surprise you about serena today ?
i want to ask you just about her power . being on the other side of the net from those shots that are coming , how is that different from most of the players that you play ?
you probably visualized in your mind , oh , you know , i 'm going to maybe play serena one day . how did it compare to your dreams or thoughts of what it might be like to be in that situation ?
what 's your next tournament ?
so when you see how good she was , what does it tell you about your game ? what do you think you need to improve to maybe compete better against her next time ?
do you think you 'll remember this match next week , or do you think or will it be a blur ?
obviously windy conditions . was n't quite your day today . what went wrong for you out there today ?
future of american tennis . were you thinking about that when you went out ? we look at the two of you as the potential future of american tennis .
few years ago , australian open semis ; toast of america . this year it 's you . you 're like following the same path . she had a rough time last year . do you ever think what she 's gone through and maybe what 's ahead for you ?
has it been tough since australia or wonderful ? or it 's like a combination ?
you 're not based here anymore ; based out of california ?
do you have a place in south florida that you live in ?
5love down in the second set your coach came out and you seemed to play a little better , but also you were in tears . every match i 'm sure means a lot to you . can you tell us what was said and how you 're feeling ?
who was that ?
you said you have an apartment in coconut creek . is that on your own ?
sloane just talked about having an apartment in fort lauderdale and how sometimes it 's kind of boring and lonely . what 's it like for you ? i assume this is your first time living on your own .
you have done it for years in boca raton .
so they are in iowa ; dad 's in chicago still ?
( indiscernible . )
looks like you kind of davenport , seems like you guys get along .
jon , he used to work in finance .
and they are splitting it ?
in all the years in south florida you never played sloane in anything ?
your movement seemed to be off today . was it the conditions or just sloane playing so well and putting you in uncomfortable conditions ?
what do you tomorrow ? practice ? sort of put this out of your mind ?
are you looking forward to the clay season ?
what 's next for you ?
have you heard from mj about fed cup ?
how was it different from your match against her at the us open ?
there is going to be hype here , obviously . do you think it 's going to be different for you ?
it 's totally normal , winning on the tour now ?
have you decided to be professional ?
it depends on maybe if you break top 100 ?
if you meet serena next , what would it mean for you ?
the power she has , the atmosphere , what kind of mindset do you have to be in on court against her ?
comparing to the us open , what have you improved on in your game ?
do you know your schedule after this tournament ?
61 , 61 , but was n't that ordinary when it came to that last game . talk about what you were going through mentally that last game .
you know , obviously two world no.1 , former no.1s ; no one is going to give up , right ?
( indiscernible . )
( question regarding facing another yearend no.1 player . )
you had to save 13 break points . that was obviously the key to the match . what do you think was the difference in those moments ?
staying calm , focusing on the moments that you 're down , also seems like today you did that very well ?
on twitter you said seven match points . oh , my lucky number .
seven . why is seven your lucky number ? any rhyme or reason ?
do you play craps in vegas a lot ?
my wife says the same thing .
can you just talk about how you 're feeling ? you 're having this resurgence at this point in your career . are you just going out there playing with a whole lot of confidence and joy right now ?
serena said the other day playing down here , does it just feel so much like home for you , being so close to home ?
i know over the years you want nothing but the best for serena , but at one point , how tough was it mentally to adjust from like being the best in the world and better than serena to now taking a little bit of a she 's kind of on top and you 're trying to get there where she 's at .
were there any highlights of today 's game , any moments you were especially proud of ?
when something like that happens and you ca n't predict , how do you physically and mentally adjust to that , the weather conditions ?
what do you say to the people that have kind of written you off and you 've come back in the tournament and you 're winning ?
so obviously you motivate yourself . what do you tell yourself like before you go out into a match ? how do you motivate yourself ?
agnieszka radwanska was talking today about having a sister who played on the tour , and how when you have a sister on tour she said it 's really a special feeling because , a , you feel like you always have a part of home traveling with you and you have someone truly , truly understands you . do you relate to that ? does having serena around all these years , do you spend time together at a tournament or are you on your separate paths ?
you have both had so much success , olympic golds and grand slams . in their case , aga has had all the success and urszula has n't . ( indiscernible . )
in a couple of weeks there will be the rival between the usa and italy in fed cup . yesterday serena said she plans to come . is true ? are you planning , too ?
( indiscernible . )
just in general , are you as surprised as you all the fans are of what happened out there ? what did you know about her coming in ? what do you think about tonight ?
both sets you came back and had chances . what was the difference in her game that you ...
little more disappointing that this loss happened the first round ?
what do you do to kind of bounce back from an early loss like this ?
what did she do really well in your mind ? what was her strength ?
how much does the missed overhead in the tiebreaker stand out in your mind or the swinging volley , i guess ?
did it affect you that the crowd was so against you ? seemed like the crowd was really cheering her on throughout the whole match .
sorry .
just sort of cheering for an upset ? they like underdogs ?
losing is never fun , but is it kind of a little bit i guess better to see it 's a fellow countrywoman of yours to get the win and move on ?
have you seen her play before ? did you know much about her ?
what 's next for you ?
how would you rate your performance today ?
what 's it like being back here ? you have won it twice but you have n't been here for two years .
i remember covering you in that big match against serena where you really had your big breakthrough several years ago . does it feel like a place that your career really took another step here ?
do you feel it from the fans ? because they have sort of seen you grow up at this tournament . do you feel when you come here the fans remember you from those other previous matches ?
playing with this weather a factor for you ? how do you see your next match ?
how do you see your next match ?
how tough are you finding the process of , like , going as an unseeded player , trying to work your way back up to obviously the top 10 ?
you have come to the net again today . is this something that is more natural for you ? is that something you feel comfortable doing against any opponent ?
what 's been the hardest part of your game to come back from this injury ?
during the time when you had those long layoffs , do you watch tennis ? do you avoid it ? how difficult is it to sort of see the tour going on without you ? how hard is that ?
you recently added someone new to your team : sascha . what part of your game do you think he 's going to add to ?
are you going to dance again ?
congratulations for the title . madrid suits your game . when you won here , you won wimbledon . what is this ? is clay the same as grass for you or what ?
must have been frustrating playing svetlana knowing she was struggling with an injury .
your record in finals now i think 165. what 's your secret ? it 's really good .
i 'm sorry to ask you in the beginning of the week if you were awake . you are awake . so sorry .
after all you 've been through these couple of months , i know it 's the second time you win this trophy , but does this one have a special feeling for you and it gives you more motivation for the rest of the season ?
what are your expectations for rome and paris after this impressive run ? do you think you can take the form even if the conditions are a bit different ?
we 've seen you play like this a lot . you 're just hitting winners everywhere . what 's going through your mind when you 're doing that ? do you feel like you can do anything ? we saw you serve and volley at one point , hit a few dropshots , aces , everything .
following your win today , media back in the czech republic are starting to talk about the french open and your hopes of winning that title . do you see yourself as a favorite for the title , and how do you cope with the media pressure ?
following your win , more people ...
now you know what 's coming . are you dating the clay do you feel ?
i would like to know if you like the trophy ?
when you saw svetlana getting a medical timeout and her injury , what was going through your mind then ? we 've seen with some players , for example stan wawrinka in the australian open final when nadal got injured , it kind of put him off . obviously did n't put you off because you won . what was going through your mind at that point in time ?
you served very well today . i do n't think anyone has asked you about when your changed your service motion . first of all , why did you change it and how difficult was it to do that ?
tough luck , but it 's a great week for you , is it ?
at the i end of the first set you took a medical timeout for an injury . talk us through that .
when you felt the pain , do you feel it yesterday or this morning ? did you ever consider pulling out of the final ?
petra played amazing , like you said , so what was going through your mind when she returned winner after winner ?
if you play , can you make the injury worse ?
i do n't know how these things work , but i saw you today and you seem really physical bad . do you think it 's the best option with the french open in the final month to go to rome and another big competition ? do n't you think that could harm you physically ?
did you ever have any doubts that you would get back to this place , even just like the smallest doubt that you thought maybe you would n't be in a big final , would n't be able to beat people like sharapova again ?
normally you did n't play well here in madrid . what happened ?
do you think you can be in shape also in roland garros , and do you think you 're one the favorites to win roland garros after doing really well here in madrid ?
now with carlos martinez , how is your relationship ? you started training in barcelona ; now you live in st. petersburg . where do you train with him ?
what do you think has changed in this tournament so you played so well ?
with the result you 're again in the top 20. is it important for you or not really important for you ?
i saw that blanca had a message on her skirt . can you tell us something about that ?
i 'll take the hit for the team . leaving the match aside , can i come back to something you said in the last press conference about petra and your admiration about that bold step to take time out . what made you admire her for doing it ?
which obviously now leads me to the question that everybody wants me to ask , which is could you talk about today and what made the difference in her game ? why did n't it work for you ?
what are the reasons for you feeling like this today ? fatigue ? tough match against azarenka ? anything going on physically ?
so you 're going to rome ?
how would you assess your tournament on the whole ?
you said you were n't serena today . what do you have to do to get back to being serena ?
we 've thrown a lot of numbers at you this week . there has been 19 matches in the winning streak ; 50 in premiers . if you had to choose one number that was your ...
just trying to read my shorthand and it 's not working .
there is 27 in total ; 19 here i think it was . but if you had to pick one number that was the ultimate milestone for you , what would it be ?
would it be the age you were with your first win ? your first slam ?
115 , is n't it ?
so the weeks at no.1 would be your ...
today it was a pretty lopsided win . what aspect of her game has changed from the last time you played her ?
at this point , who would you say are the favorites for the french open ?
we had different players doing really well over the last two or three weeks , and now with coming rome . you do n't see anyone in particular or the usual suspects ?
sorry to start it off , but your reflections on the match and svetlana 's form .
sveta has n't beaten you for seven years before today . did her form catch you by surprise at all ?
is it different to play her on clay because of her topspin ? is it maybe the reason why it was a bit more difficult for you today ?
can you be satisfied with your week after the injuries and the little preparation you had , making the semifinals ?
what are your feelings about your performance in the tournament ?
regarding the previous injury , no setback this week ? you feel 100 % going to rome ?
i would like to ask you how you are out of tennis ? how is your day ? how are you feeling out of tennis ? how are you these days ? and if you 're going to watch the quarterfinal between rafa and grigor ?
how did you feel in the second set ? you started to make a little bit more errors . how nervous were you feeling and how do you think that impacted the match ?
do i even have to say the words ? are you dating the clay now ?
how does it feel knowing you got your first win over her ?
what do you expect from tomorrow 's final ? you had a great match last year at the french open against svetlana .
served for the match at 52 and serena broke back . what went through your mind when she broke back ? do you feel like , oh , god , here we go ; i 've got to close this out ?
you played very well . do you feel there was any area of your game in particular that was on fire today ?
at one point you hit an angled dropshot and then ran to the net and hit a winner off a dropshot . what was going through your mind then ? that 's not the usual for you .
it worked .
also on serena , she said she really likes you and you had a nice handshake . is it i guess surprising how kind of warm she is compared to how people see her from the outside ?
in the beginning of the week i asked you if you were back , and obviously you are .
welcome back . this week svetlana has had a tough schedule with the time . most of their games are in three sets . do you think that physically this could be an advantage for you tomorrow ?
when you took your break you said you did n't miss tennis much . now that you 're back , was it easy for you to fall in love with the game again ?
it 's an interesting thing you say about friends on the tour . last year when you won wimbledon and beat genie , she said before in the conference that she did n't feel she needed friends . is that a big part of it for you , that you 've got a nice relationship with people outside or in the locker room as well as fighting them on the court ?
going back to an earlier question , obviously beating serena was a big milestone for you . how is that compared to other milestones ? first wta title ? first grand slam title ? is it on the same level , or is it a very different feeling ?
do you think beating serena today is the biggest mental peace you 've had for a long time ?
a week ago you lost to zhang 63 , 62. a week later you 're here in the final . we 're still trying to figure you out . can you explain how this happened ?
what was the difference today against maria ? first of all , perhaps the surface ? serving ? your variety ?
thank you .
how were you feeling physically after the match yesterday ?
quite a few players have come back after repetitive injuries , and you 've had a couple years where you suffered with injuries and coming back . they always say they feel blessed about having another chance and do n't take anything for granted . is that how you feel ?
people love you because of that sort of lack of consistency for lack of a better ...
yeah , that is a better word .
that 's one of the reasons you 're an enduring favorite with the fans . in terms of your experience , do you think that 's helped pull you through this week , especially after a firstround loss in the clay season in prague ?
no .
you talked about your inconsistency on the court . how do you think your mentality affect that in a way ?
you 've played five matches , two of them against the two top 10 players who , and they were quite quick . the other ones were very long . is there a reason for that ? maybe less pressure when you come up against makarova and sharapova ?
and on maria , after the fed cup , the one she played , you posted a video on instagram . you were on the streets and you were yelling stuff and she was laughing in the background . what is she like as a person when you 're on the same side ?
about the inconsistency , if i asked you a question now would you rather be a consistent player now making finals and ...
obviously you 're coming up to the french open . you 've got a great vein of form here ; into the final rome to follow . you 've won the french open . do you feel you could be a contender this year ?
yesterday maria sharapova said wozniacki likes to play with the crowd and the umpire . when you 've played wozniacki before , have you experienced any similarities to this ?
i was going to ask about tomorrow , serena and petra are playing now . petra has served for the match , but serena is coming back . do you have a preference ?
but would you prefer to play serena ?
how would you assess the start to your clay season so far ?
there has been a few disgruntled players about line calls and stuff . there was something about the net cord that bugged you at the start . do you think that threw you off ?
maria got off to an incredible start . did that force you to change how you approach the match at all ?
where do you go from here ?
in the third set seems that you have all under control , and suddenly you get the break down . what happened ?
she played well at the end to take the final break . is it easier to take when a player steps up like that or is winning and losing black and white to you ?
may i ask you what you were saying to maria at the net at the end ?
you seemed to have a chat about something .
after the start to the season , what would be your definitive ranking of your favorite surfaces ?
you 've got an impressive record against carla , but this time she actually managed to put up a little bit of a fight in the second set . against you it would be very mental for her . give us some thoughts on the match ?
on the subject of fist pumps , what do you think makes a good one ? real vigor or just perhaps quiet determination ?
really ?
this is your 50th straight premier mandatory win . you did n't know that ?
now you do . thinking back to five or ten years ago when you played in these events , how did you approach them ? back then your record in these kinds of events was n't as good .
you said at the start of the week that your preparation was n't as perfect as you hoped it would be . given this week you 've had a tough draw and come through some very tough matches , do you think that you 're getting into sort of optimal condition on the clay ?
so 24 hours later and what did you learn after the azarenka match , and if the lesson gave you some clues for improvement ?
the next match , petra kvitova or begu . what are your thoughts about that match ?
petra said she had to take the time out because she felt the constant grind of the four years since her wimbledon breakthrough had become too much . it was a bold decision to make . what are your thoughts on having the courage to do that at that stage in her career ?
you said it was n't quite 24 hours between the two games . yesterday andy was playing until 3:00 a.m. do you think something needs to be done about the organization at the tournament here and not have six games on the same court every day ?
were you dancing at the end when you put your racquet away ? you did a weird thing .
are you feeling like the favorite for the tournament now ? you said no at the beginning , and now sharapova is playing quite well , too .
more than you ?
21 down in the third set , break down , and you 're calling for your coach . momentum totally switched again .
caroline talked about the net calls in the first set . do you have any comments on that ?
back to oncourt coaching , do you just use it because you can ? because at the end of the day at a slam it 's just you and your opponent . what are your thoughts ?
people have talked a lot about wozniacki 's resurgence over the last two years . they have said this is a brand new , more aggressive wozniacki . do you agree with that , or do you think it 's just the same old wozniacki who puts the ball in the court , makes you play longer rallies , and tries to grind you down ?
yesterday the last match of the day on center court started at 1:12 a.m. what do you think about those late starts ? do you think there should be a rule to prevent that ?
there is nothing to do ? have top players an influence on that ?
on a slightly lighter note , what do you think makes a good definitive fist pump : the quiet steely determination or fullon adrenaline spin your arms around ?
i see you steely determined most of the time .
looking back to last year when you played caroline , lost in three sets . how would you assess your performance today compared to your two performances last year ? do anything differently ?
how do you disconnect between your matches since you win until your next match ?
you have seen training very early this morning , 9:30 i think . how important for you is to get a good result here in madrid for the season ?
what were you telling caroline at the end of the match at the net ? you seemed to be chatting .
can we get back to the game ? after that first set , that amazing first set , you lose the second set .
what goes on in your mind when you lose the second set ? you think , okay i got to go with the third set again with this player ?
looked like your easiest win so far , but still a bit of a battle . she played very well .
i was n't going to ask because i did n't want to throw you off . no , looked like a better win . looked like you were much more settled this time round . was that the case ?
serena next . you must be quite excited for that .
did you watch serena a lot when you were kind of a junior ?
do you watch tennis now ?
yeah .
on a slightly lighter note , what is the definitive fist pump for you ?
like motivating yourself ?
you said you prefer to watch men . any particular men you like watching ?
and good result on clay here making semifinals . grass has proved to be your best surface so far with two wimbledon titles . do you feel like your clay game is catching up to your grass game ?
because we are from the romanian press , i 'm going to ask you how would you characterize irina begu 's game . you said she did an early good game . what do you think happened , after and was it maybe physical ?
we covered in stuttgart the reasons why you decided to take the two months off . you 're now in your second semifinal since i think sydney at the beginning of the year . does that vindicate what you did in taking time off ? do you feel that 's a good indication of the results of that ?
many wta players change coaches quite a lot . you 've obviously been with david for quite a long time . over like the past four years , since wimbledon 2011 , have your routines and training changed ? how much has it changed ?
how do you feel physically after two tough matches yesterday and today ?
she was serving for the match and then you won the match . actually , you are from russia , not the czech republic .
how did you feel when she was serving for the match ?
the match against sharapova , we all know your headtohead . how will you prepare for that ? how will you recover ?
does it suit you that there is no pressure on you at all ? will you be able to just hit free tomorrow , or do you think that playing maria and knowing she is the defending champion is going to make you maybe a little tighter ?
so twice now you 've been on the same court as andy and played a long three setter . do you think you owe him a nice big wedding present for keeping him away from the court until , what was it , 1:00 a.m. yesterday ?
how do you feel the scheduling has gone this year and how tough is it ?
seems that you want to be up there again . what does carlos martnez help with ? how does he help ?
great start . you 're obviously building some momentum after stuttgart . sort of give us a rundown of how you felt you played today , especially against radwanska .
i have n't got my wingman here with the stats of your clay court season from last year to this year , but it 's got to give you a lot of confidence .
i did n't want to draw attention to that . have you been able to touch base with arantxa and see how that 's progressing against your map for the clay court season ?
you play maria sharapova next . her clay record has been exceptional . how do you feel about that match ?
it always feels like there is an extra bit of fire when you play maria . do you feel it from your side of the court ?
for arantxa , what specifically do you think she 's advised you on or brought to your clay court game so far ?
looking towards wimbledon , you 're playing one grasscourt tournament . any reason ?
do you think working with sanchez vicario will better fit you in grass ? you were a semifinalist in wimbledon two years in a row .
you debuted the headband in stuttgart . it got quite good reviews .
will you be bringing it back ? really important question here .
what a match . it was incredible .
what was your first impression after that ? what 's your opinion about the match in general ?
you 've done so many matches around in your career . does it give you extra confidence when you 're back is on the wall like 65 , 40love ? do you keep the hope because you 've done that so many times already ?
did you at all believe that you could still win at that point ?
you and victoria were at the start of a really good , enduring rivalry before injury sort of pretty much took her out last year . the fact that you 're saying you thought you were down and out is very interesting . so you think you 'll be at a stage to pick up that rivalry ? looks like she 's very much on her way back .
do you think she did anything different today with the new coach ? anything particularly special ?
what exactly were you thinking when you were 40love in the last game , 65 ? you started to play such amazing points with so much power and so inspirational . did you think something before that point when you were three match points down ?
you said that you got fed up with yourself and you were feeling it was n't your day . how did you see it when suddenly victoria started to really mess up and start double faulting ? i do n't know , i almost lost count . what were your feelings at that point ?
you have any memories of pull out of any other situation like this ? is today the greatest escape of your career that you are remind of ?
how do you recover mentally and physically for your next match ?
you saved three match points . are you now more mentally strong for the rest of the tournament ?
you 're such a champion . you 've won almost everything . where do you get such strength and how do you keep motivated tournament after tournament year after year ?
that was a close one . do you think the break point you saved at the start of the third set was maybe the key moment ?
she was obviously disappointed at the end . you did give her a look after getting a hand slap . from the point of view of the younger players coming up , do you feel that sometimes they react badly , or do you just brush it off ?
when she hits , takes so many things on and is aggressive , is it easier to take than maybe when you 're the one playing badly and you 're making errors ?
caroline has never managed to defeat any of the top 5 players . today she proved to be a tough opponent . were you surprised by the fact that she was able to put that much pressure on you ?
sorry to talk about clay , but was there a moment in the past where you put that away and stopped being selfdeprecating and started believing you could succeed on this surface ? was there a match or a certain point ?
i would like to know if you enjoy playing your matches , or is it just hard and serious work that ca n't be enjoyed ?
feels like your mental strength and determination has become one of the , if not the , key components of your game . would you agree with that ?
you spoke yesterday about hitting with a lot of depth . today you said you had to take a bit off the ball and be more consistent . is that something you learned , or have you always thought like that on the court ?
caroline 's father is her coach , and he says she tends to respect you too much . players tend to respect you serena , and even vika too . when you started your career were you in this position , fighting a great player and thinking , wow ?
it 's been a tough couple weeks i think parting ways with martina and not a great start in stuttgart . how are you easing into your clay court season after the loss to caroline today ?
how is your shoulder ? i notice it 's been strapped for a couple weeks .
did the split with martina come as a surprise , or had you seen to coming for a while ?
what you did you learn from her in the time you were together ? what 's the lingering legacy ?
at the risk of being terribly british about this , to look forward to wimbledon with all should that she achieved there , what you learned from her , can that help you when you get to wimbledon ?
you 're not the only person that 's parted with a coach . ana did this last weekend . she felt that it was down to her ; there was nobody else to blame . did you feel that when you played your firstround match ? in the past you seemed conflicted when martina came in . your instincts seemed to have deserted you . first round match you seem to have that back .
yesterday you said that you were getting to be friends with the clay . are you dating the clay yet ?
thinking about clay , your first big result was at the french open in '08 . what were your thoughts on it then ? was it a surprise ?
it was about begu , the question . did you play with her ? yes . and you do n't remember .
so it will be a total surprise for you ?
like in a relationship . ( laughter . )
can you remember much about the french open in 2008 when you made the fourth round there ?
no , no .
2008 french open .
you stop for a while just to i think get some focus and some rest . you lose some rhythm i think . we have petra back , 100 % petra ?
obviously a tough loss . you played good tennis during two sets , but then in the third your intensity dropped a bit . do you agree with that ?
we 're halfway through the clay court season . you have to go to rome . what positives can you take out of this , especially after such a turbulent week ?
is that just because it 's taken you a while to get the broken toe fixed and back to that level of fitness that you need ?
you both looked friendly at the net at the end . did you say something to carla ?
what do you think about carla ? do you think we will see her in the future top 5 or 3 ?
i do n't want to be the one that keeps coming back to the coaching , but just trying to find a positive for you . do you think it 'll help you build your own internal strength having to go on your own now for maybe the rest of the clay court season before you put something in place for grass ?
just a followup question on that . i know andrea petkovic said coming into slam she would try not to have the coach come on court just to make herself selfreliant because in the slams you ca n't .
darren cahill was there today . are you getting some help from him ?
if organization is the issue , should we all have a whip around and buy you an organizer ? would that help ?
because i 've got 20 euros i can lend you .
on the minute ?
you set any goals for the clay season , rome , roland garros , or just go and try to play as much as you can ?
your brother was here this week with you . it is important for you to have him around ?
how would you summarize the match for us ?
you definitely should , because you were at the start of a very enduring rivalry with serena before the injury took you out . you must take a lot out of being on court that long and pushing her that hard . just a shame that your serving let you down right when you really needed it .
is that something you 've gained a lot more with wim fissette this year , being able to look back and be a lot more positive after these outcomes , especially as you 're coming back ?
from 51 the break of the first set and 65 , 40love in the last set , would it be fair to say emotions got the best of you in those moments ?
yes .
what was the game plan going into the match ? anything different ?
no , but ...
okay . you looked quite in control . obviously there was a moment in the second set where it was tough , but then you came back . having seen you through the years , you looked really in control . i felt , wow . what was it do , you think that suddenly because there was a moment when that final millimeter of getting the ball just in started to leave . what were you thinking in those moments ?
it was your first time playing serena since your return . is it possible during the match to enjoy the battle , the good tension during the match ?
serena won 23 matches this year . do you feel that you 're the toughest opponent that serena has to face ?
but do you feel like that ?
serena told us that on that famous last point when you came close to an ace , she thought if were going to challenge it you were going to double fault . what would you say about that ? she raised her finger and you went forward and challenged the call . did that put you off , that moment ?
as you know , rankings can be deceiving at times . do you see yourself as a top player at the moment , or do you feel you 're a bit lower down ?
at the moment you 're 31 in the rankings . they 're deceiving . where do you see yourself at the moment ? do you think you can be as good as the top 5 , top 3 , or do you feel lower down ?
do you feel like a top10 player ?
do you feel inside yourself that you 're a top10 player no matter what the ranking says ?
obviously you had a big injury that kept you out most of last season . do you feel with coming very , very close to beating serena that you 're back on the right track to getting back to the level you were previously ?
indian wells you were wearing bright , mixmatched fruit , and at night clashing colors . happy with nike 's choice for the european season ?
yeah , we think more blueberry actually .
safe to say you 're feeling much more comfortable now on the clay after today .
how different is it defending a tournament ? you 've obviously won so many . is it just another regular tournament to you now ?
is miami injury completely in the past , and have you been able to train how you want to since ?
what do you think exactly failed from your opponent , duque marino , in this match ?
you said recently that wta ranking is not your concern . it 's not so important . it 's more important how you feel on the court . is it from the distance a fight distance , a fight between you and simona halep ? now she 's gone and you will become again no.2 .
gulbis recently talked about top players in general ?
top players can intimidate lower players with your presence . do you feel that when you stride into a room and everyone is looking at you ? do you feel that you 're intimidating ?
do you feel any more pressure to defending titles ? you have to defending in germany ; you lost early . now you have to defending here and you have to defend roland garros . do you feel more pressure when you have to defend these titles ?
how is your mentality since the start of the year ? obviously you 've been injured . are you feeling less confidence or more confidence going towards the french open ?
no , compared to the start of the year . you got injuries ; lost in first round in germany . has that affected your confidence in any way ?
this is better than stuttgart then .
pleasing signs of aggression coming back into your game . talk a little bit about what you think has changed or the last couple weeks .
did you feel you had some confidence coming back from such a tight firstround match ? could have gone very badly for you .
did that give you a lot more confidence coming into this one ?
this is your best win in terms of ranking of the year . do you think that this is the confidence boost that you needed for the rest of the clay season ?
your coach was not there today . any problem ?
so you 're going to go it alone now for the rest of clay court season ?
going to try to get somebody in place for the grass court season ? you 're defending in birmingham as well .
how did you feel the crowd today ? there was a full stadium and they were going for you .
your next opponent will be carl suarez navarro or julia goerges . opinions about both ? carla has had an amazing year . she 's fifth in the race .
on the topic of your coach , is there any chance at all that you will turn like a lot of the other professionals to a super coach in the future ?
we spoke to you last year after you parted with nigel and you went on to win ; you 've switched coaches twice now . you 're a nice person . what is it about you that is resulting in you and coaches parting company ?
in all seriousness though , do you feel it 's making you stronger as a person having to go through the adjustments and changes , especially at this point in your career ?
martina navratilova and radwanska broke up . would you ever consider navratilova to be your coach ? do you think she would bring anything to your game ?
no .
who would be ideal if you could have anyone in the world ?
tell us something about the match . can you give us your opinion of it ?
there was a moment in the match where you were 63 , 43 down with set point for kuznetsova . i talked about it with you , with your trainer . before in those matches you let them go , and now you have like a plan b. even if you play bad , you 're still there . do you think this match is on the right path ?
yesterday you were talking about the consistency . for younger players it 's a little bit more difficult . do you think you were lacking a little bit of consistency ? the second set you were doing really well , but not in the third .
let 's talk about the positive things of the day . last year you made it far in the doubles . do you think this year you can win ? do you want to do well in the doubles here in spain ? can you talk about the tournament ?
what do you learn from a loss like today ?
you 're no.15 in this year 's race . is the top 10 a goal for you ?
the other day i was interviewing serena 's trainer and we were talking about you and last year 's match . he said that you were a great player . so are you working on being more consistent ? if you 're working on that , how do you see yourself ? do you think that you 're doing things well ?
you were talking that you like the show , the central court , all the media on top of you . you have a lot of media on you . here in spain we 're waiting for players like you that make tennis big again . what do you think about that ? how do you handle the pressure of the media ? is this a little bit difficult for you ? have you talked about this with your trainer ?
the season so far is going as you were expecting at the beginning of the year ?
you were talking about stability , but i would like to know tennistically , technically , what do you think you have to develop ? your backhand ? can you say something about that ? what would you like to be better at in your game ?
a very difficult match today . tell us what happened basically . vika was just better on the day or did you feel like you were a bit off form ?
just the incident towards the end of the first set , just from perspective , do you feel that changed the momentum of the match or anything like that ?
just lastly , next week you 're heading to kuala lumpur , so the plan is to just head there and get some good matches before u.s. tournaments ?
i wonder if you could draw on your experience over the years going up in rankings and then down and bringing it back again . what were some of the tactics you used sort of when you were kind of in that low and trying to regain again ?
do you remember any instances where you felt you were very low , like what is sort of feels like ? does it affect your sleep , your eating ?
andrea , so you had three straight threeset matches , two in stanford , one here and then now you finally got one in straits . so talk about your progression over the course of the last couple of weeks and where do you think do you come out of this one positive ?
can you set aside i know you 've in the past been incredibly complimentary about serena . things like that . if you step on the court against her tomorrow , can you set all that aside ?
a lot of when she 's written about or when you talk to other players about her , everybody focuses on the power , obviously the serve ?
forehand , things . do you think that i mean there 's more to her game than that .
given the wind conditions here and in new york it 'll be much worse actually .
yeah . when you play serena tomorrow , would you try to change a little bit with your hits or would it be flatter or more top spin to put the ball in play ?
so you tweeted last week that you saw `` whiplash ? ''
like a lot of athletes that i 've talked to that have seen it ?
there 's similarities that they can take out of it with respect to the coach , people , relationship . and i 'm just kind of curious what your thoughts are on that .
on the ownership , and also whether or not
yeah . a little bit , you know . i mean if greatness can be found that way , is it okay ? i mean
it looked like a tough one in the second set there and you were able to rally back . how was your back feeling and also how were you able to turn that set around ?
and you mentioned some changes in preparation . can you talk us through what your post wimbledon has been like and how you 've prepared for the u. s. hardcourt season ?
could you just talk about your time so far in toronto ? i know that you seem to like the city . you were at the players ' party . just want to talk about your experience in toronto so far .
and just want to get your thoughts on how you 'd like to do in this tournament .
you 've been able to do something that not a lot of players have been able to do . you were no.1 in the world , dropped down to about 65 and have been able to make it back . what tactics have you used over the years to be able to reemerge the way you have ?
what advice would you have for somebody like genie who experienced such a rise at a young age like you did and is experiencing a tougher season now ?
when you were down in the mid 60s there , what did you tell yourself to keep going when you were going through some coaches , and you had some injury problems and the losses seemed to keep piling up ? how did you get back on that rise ?
when you 've been no.1 before , can you ever be satisfied with less , and how do you sort of reset your goals ?
you sort of had your first big win here . i mean it was in montreal . but at this tournament . what do you remember about that , and how do you compare yourself now and then ?
at this point going into the rest of the season , how would you compare the last , i guess , eight months of the seven or eight months of the season compared to the first seven or eight months of last season , like how do you compare these two seasons so far ?
and do you think that the foot injury still from january kind of do you feel that still affected that ?
when you were working with some serbian coaches , you talked about how it 's easier when you can communicate in your own language and share your culture . now you 're sort of working with someone else from somewhere else . can you still talk about that ?
and can you just talk a little bit about why you picked going back to nigel ?
for the top players on the tour contending for grand slams , does it ever get a little frustrating knowing that one player well into her mid 30s is still playing at such a dominant , high level and she 's always looming in the slams ?
solid win today against a very dangerous opponent , facing your first match of the tournament . how do you feel about your play today ?
so after the break , is it a little bit easier to come in and play stress free and sort of start from scratch on the hardcourts ?
were you surprised by the number of romanian tennis fans in the crowd today and how does that affect you on court ?
simona , what were you most pleased with today in your game and how much did this help your confidence ?
and when you spend so much time practicing and then you come back to your first match , what 's the biggest difference for you between practice matches and actual matches ?
how did you feel you played in your match ?
has this year been more tiring for you just given that you have higher seeds , because you have to play a lot more in the tournaments and you have tougher matches earlier on ? has the year been more tiring than previous years when you had a higher seed ?
what 's the weirdest thing like when you spend a specific training block , just training and practicing and then stepping on to the match court you were saying it can be a little bit , it takes some time to get the rhythm , but is it physical , is it mental , is it tactical ? what is the biggest difference between your practice court game and what happens in the match ?
when you 've been healthy you 've been one of the players who 's been able to challenge serena the most consistently . what do you recall most about those two us open finals you played against her ?
is there something that comes back to you just when you think about the occasion of playing her on that stage ?
when you 're out there , your game , does it feel like it 's getting back to that level where you were at ? i know you just said you do n't look back , but when you 're playing does it feel like you 're at that level when you were playing in 2012 and 2013 ?
have you thought about your next match at all ?
after as well as you played on the clay and then into the grass , when you kind of sat down with sascha and with winn afterwards and hit into this training block , was it like , okay , let 's just keep doing what we 've been doing and making the gradual progression forward or were there certain more drastic changes or anything that maybe you thought let 's definitely key in on this before we head into the hard court stretch ?
when you came back on tour having been kind of injured for a while , was there like a sense of freshness and newness to the tour again which maybe had gone away when you were playing in europe ?
just sort of freshness , newness like you were starting again , like you were young again almost ?
what are some of those things off the court ?
and what are some of the areas you still kind of looking to get better , either on court or off court ?
what 's next for you after this ?
and you know yourself , you 're one of the rising stars for canada . what does that mean to you to have this experience this week ?
what changes are you planning to make for vancouver ?
any changes that you have in mind ?
yes . for your next tournament .
what is your biggest struggle ? what are some of your struggles at this point in your career ? what is the biggest struggle that you 're encountering ?
that 's not what i mean , struggling . a challenge or something that you 're
having fought so hard to get back into that match from 41 down leading 2 nil . what do you take that , a feeling of frustration or are you very proud of the way you fought back ?
how were you feeling playing your first grand slam final ? were you nervous ? excited ? what was it like being on that court at that time ?
when serena gets on a roll like she did in the third set , is she olympic impossible to stop ?
that game in the second set at 65 when she was serving for the match when you broke her , was it a game where you thought a lot or did n't think at all ? how would you describe how you handled that game ?
serena was ill in the couple of days before the match . did you notice anything different about her level physically ? did she seem to be less than 100 % ?
you also have a final tomorrow . how are you going to prepare yourself to this final ?
what did you learn or what did you prove to yourself over the course of the last two weeks ? just in singles , obviously . your tournament is n't over . but it was an impressive two weeks .
a lot of talk for serena will turn to the calendar slam , trying to win all four of the majors this year . is that something you think she can do ? and also , did your perspective of her change at all this tournament , being in a grand slam for all seven matches along with serena ?
we were speaking to bethanie yesterday , and she was saying you 're doing great in tiebreaks . she feels you 're loving them and feel confident in them . you won all six you have played in singles here . do you feel that confident that in the tight moments you can actually break through , or is this something new for you ?
just a word on this incredible atmosphere , in the end of the second set , particularly . the crowd was for you and they cheered for you all the time .
you said earlier that serena elevated her game . she raised her game at the end and probably in the beginning of the match , as well . do you see this after the match as saying , well , too good , serena was just too good today , or were there moments or opportunities that you look back on where you think maybe you could have turned things around ?
you got to a grand slam final . how do you think you 'll cope with the next tournaments where people will be coming for you because you have been in a grand slam final ? you 'll have a new status on the circuit .
do you realize you 're in the first grand slam final here in paris ?
can you talk about the two biggest moments of this match . you had a slow start and then you came back , and then you had to close it out in the second set ?
how are has your coach , rob , helped you get to this point ?
your game suits any kind of court , also clay , because in covered courts you are dangerous , grass . how is this possible ?
you are on a very good dynamic . what will you work for the final ? will you keep it that way and see what 's going on ?
what do you prefer , serena or timea ?
you must have received a lot of congratulations from other players . i just saw safina tweeted you 're the nicest girl on the tour .
do you believe the good girl can win the title ? ( laughter . )
it will be your first grand slam final . how do you think you are going to deal with it mentally ? are you going to try to talk to some other players ? petra already did finals . does it help you to maybe prepare for the pressure ?
you had a pretty good start of the match today . can you explain why it turned this way and maybe why you lost a bit of momentum ?
you think it 's all the matches before that maybe drained you a little bit , or change of the weather ?
at the end of the second set , did you feel maybe it could turn again because she was getting nervous ?
it was a nervy match for both . you were amazing in the beginning . a strange match , or is safarova that more control in of the ball ?
do you think this tournament is going to maybe change the other part of your season , that it 's going to give you maybe a second breath ?
what are your plans for the coming grass season ?
just a quick word on the game yesterday between novak and rafa nadal . wanted to know if you watched it . what do you think about what novak is accomplishing this season , and what kind of inspiration he is for serbian players and people ?
was it difficult to play against a player who seems to be not really well but then hitting serves of 200 kilometers when she needs to ?
up a set and a break . do you feel that you let that go a little bit in those next couple of games , or was this an instance of serena completely raising her level ? was any of this on your racquet , do you think ?
how do you think you handled the occasion of the first grand slam semifinal on chatrier against serena , no.1 , all of that ? what was that like for you ? how do you feel you handled it ?
were you very aware that serena williams was struggling between points on the other side of the net , or did you just try and block that out ? i imagine that is quite difficult to do .
there was a couple of points in the third set when you hit the two forehands , two unforced errors . how much did that affect your concentration for the rest of the match ?
i know you said you 're very focused on your side of the court and what you had to do , but how much , if at all , does it come into your mind that you 're playing serena williams , and does it feel like her limit is limitless , that she can bring another gear when she needs to ?
did you have the impression that the fifth game of the second set , that is when you broke her , it was the sixth break point , but what 's paradoxical is that it was in the court , and therefore the question is what did you say when you shook hands ?
what about your tears when you left the court ? what was there in these tears ?
i 'd like to know about serena and how theatrical she was when she was showing people she was perhaps sick . do you think it 's natural for her to do this , or do you think it was a tactic that she had come up with to destabilize the other player ? is it physical or mental ? i do n't know .
you were saying you were coolheaded . 64 , 32 when you were sitting down , did you think at that moment you would reach the finals ? i do n't know . you know , it was only three more games for you to win the match .
we were talking about how that last match against sara errani last month was such a tough one . what was the difference for you today ? you really took it to her .
do you feel back to yourself now ? i mean , after the three previous matches dropping first set each time , not sort of feeling comfortable from the get go ; today , 61 , first set , you looked a lot more comfortable out there .
we talk about how you 're such a tough opponent to play in the second week of a major for anyone you face . do you feel that ? do you feel a new gear for yourself once you get deep into a tournament that you 're on lockdown and you 're focused on winning the title ?
what has she changed up or what did she change up at the fed cup and today ?
or before fed cup .
is this your fourth semifinal here now . fewer than the other grand slams . is that of some significance for you , getting this far in this tournament , considering how tough it 's been ?
you have been like the player to beat for so long . how do you handle that pressure when you 've been the person to beat for more than like 10 , 12 years now ? how do you handle that pressure ?
you 'll be the favorite again in the semifinal against bacsinszky , who you played in indian wells . what are your memories of that match , and what do you expect from her coming up ?
earlier in the tournament you were talking about how you try not to look ahead in the draw , who you play next , etcetera . at this point , are you aware of what else is happening in the tournament overall by people you 're seeing in the locker room and that kind of thing ?
after monday 's match you said that you needed to get off the edge . did you feel off that today , back more in control ?
bacsinszky stepped away from tennis for a couple of years and went to hotel management school and was n't sure tennis was for her anymore . was there ever a moment you thought about walking away from tennis ? obviously it 's been an intense part of your life . was there ever a moment where you came close to saying , no more ?
to that point , do you feel like those breaks , whether it be personal or when you 've had those injuries or illnesses , do you feel like those have prolonged your career and made you hungry at 33 to still win these majors ?
thoughts on the match going on right now , nadal and djokovic ? what do you expect ? it 's 5all in the first .
you had played serena very closely in that fed cup match last month . what was the difference today ? what did she do differently ?
you have played serena in many different settings . what makes her particularly tough , say , in the second week of a grand slam ?
in the later part of a grand slam , quarterfinal or semifinal , how is serena so tough in those matches ?
is it just a question of serena 's power that is the trouble , or do you think she is moving better on clay ? what is it about her game ?
do you think you did what you set out to do , what you wanted to do today ?
seemed like you handled the occasion of being a favorite in a grand slam quarterfinal pretty well . did it feel like a whole new experience for you , or did it feel like something you were ready for ?
in a grand slam quarterfinal .
being into a semifinal of a grand slam and against serena , too what do you expect from this occasion ? do you think you 're going to hit any dropshot returns ?
and the dropshots ?
what was it like when you left the tour and you went into hotel management and you were working in restaurants and things like that ? what did you learn from that that translates into how you 're playing now ?
did that also make you say , look , i need to take advantage ; i can play tennis , and really give it another shot ? and also , does it make you tip the maid better when you 're in a hotel ?
do you tip the maid better now than ...
what is a proper amount to tip ?
with all the growing and learning you did about yourself while you were away from the game , when you came back , did you have any sense that it was going to be enough of an improvement to put you in the semifinals of a grand slam ? did you sense that you were going to be a much better tennis player now , or are you surprised by this ?
you were talking about the players , the fact that you were not a favorite , but you 're going to play against a player with 19 grand slams under her belt . are we on equal footing ?
you played twice against her in march . can you tell us about this match , the impressions of this match , and especially the matches in march ?
today you have put in a good showing , even though your opponent came back . you are quite serene and calm . when you do n't play between matches , what do you do to stay in the tournament , to remain focused on the tournament ?
what type of music do you listen to ?
what have you written on the camera ? what about your family ? will they turn up ?
how proud are you of yourself and the way you managed to back up yesterday 's win with another spectacular win ?
is paris becoming your favorite city ? because in 2007 you played the final in coubertin , beating three top 10 players . and here in roland garros you beat amlie mauresmo ; that was also in 2007. and today this semifinal .
today how did you manage to play with this wind which was very difficult ?
can you explain the buildup , the tournaments you played leading into this , and how it turned out how you played so well when you got here ?
how would you compare the wind to other conditions you 've played in ? on chatrier there was an incident where part of the scoreboard was blown down and fell on the crowd . does it seem like an especially terrible wind today ?
usually when it 's this windy the quality of play is not high , but you and garbie in the first set were just amazing . did you manage to take it in , like during the first set and after you won the tiebreak and realized just how good of an example of women 's tennis you guys were giving ?
what about the semifinals with ana ? how do you feel about that ?
do you have to make sure that you still realize the goal is to win the tournament ?
what can you say about your match ? how do you feel ?
would you say that the conditions on the court were negative or bad for you ?
the other day you were saying that last year against sharapova you had learned that the point is not just to play well but also to have a steellike mental .
what are the things you will take home from this roland garros tournament ?
well , the fact that she 's a lefty , is this something that had an impact on you ? what about the impact of her being a lefty on the whole match ?
i suppose you 're going to leave the tournament being rather satisfied , which is what you said , but then halep and sharapova are out , and therefore the draw is much more open . what do you think about this ? is this not getting on your nerves ?
now , maybe you will not want to answer this question but if you do n't , it does n't matter . will you watch this match tomorrow , that is , rafa against novak ? rafa was saying it was not `` the '' match of the year , but what do you think about this , please ?
sorry for perhaps talking about this again . coming back to this loss , is it this one that 's bitter or the one last year sharapova ?
well , you told safarova that you hope she 's going to win the tournament . do you think that she can win the tournament here ?
what did this win mean to you ? obviously it was another emotional one , but this one was fairly straightforward . you showed a lot of poise despite the occasion .
how pleased are you with yourself in terms of handling it mentally and emotionally ? because you mentioned you 're a combustible person , but at the same time , like i ben said , you were very poised .
you came into this tournament and said that you had no idea what to expect from yourself here . looking back on your tournament so far , i mean , can you talk about that a little bit ? like what has it been like match to match , day to day for you ?
does this feel like a familiar feeling for you when you 're winning a grand slam quarterfinal match ? you have done it before , but because of the time does it feel like a whole new thing or like something , oh , yeah i remember this ?
you spoke earlier in the week about how it 's difficult to find the right coach and right team and people you are comfortable with . what kind of things are clicking between you and mats ? what 's special about this partnership ?
several years ago you talked about how you had lost confidence . what did you do to get it back ?
how are you different today than you were as the same woman sitting in that chair seven years ago in 2008 ?
on to the next one , safarova ? you have had tough matches against her . you won your last match . what do you make of that matchup , and what it 's going to be like in a grand slam semifinal against her ?
similar to what you were just asked , what do you think yourself today would tell yourself in 2008 ? or what piece of advice would you give that young girl seven years ago ?
do you think you 're easier on yourself these days ?
it 's obviously been a long road from 2008 to now . what kind of support are you sensing out there ? do you feel people are really rooting for you to get back to where you were ?
it 's just the second time in your career that you have come back from a set down three times in a row in a major . what do you attribute that to , those slow starts , and also , what do you attribute the fight to come back in each of those three matches ?
yes , it was . do you know which tournament ?
well done .
i 'm curious what you think the slow starts are attributed to , and then also , you have been able to flip the switch really right when you 've needed to in those matches .
one fight after the other . is it taking a lot out of you or are you gaining confidence ?
not only in roland garros you lose the first set and then you win at the end , also in fed cup versus sara errani , which is your next opponent . what do you remember of that match ? because you had two points from defeat and you came back at the end . is it going to happen again the same ?
in general terms , what changed in her game ? that was obviously a tough match but you have had some not so tough matches against her in the past also .
is the elbow playing at 100 % or are you at a point where you 're maintaining whatever ache it is ?
when you fell behind , how much do you think mentally is them feeling the pressure of trying to beat the no.1 player and how much of it might be just you are really tough when it comes down to it ?
more general question . obviously this year a little different because there will be three weeks between here and wimbledon . i 'm just wondering , your general impressions of that , and what are positives and maybe some of the negatives of that ?
you said in french at the end that experience helps you get through these kind of things , and also the crowd was part of it , as well . how do you reflect on the change , your relationship with the crowd over the past decade or so ? it has been a bit edgy in the past .
a question on errani . for the fourth time in a row she 's in the quarterfinals at roland garros , and everybody says that she probably has the weakest serve on the top 100 girls . how do you explain that that can happen ? i mean , what is your reaction to that ? what are her strengths ? finals in 2012 , semifinals 2013 , quarterfinals here 2014 , and quarterfinals now .
tomorrow night you 'll be named the itf champion from last year , not the first time and everything , but what do those kind of awards mean to you , those kind of honors ?
two things . do you feel like you 're living dangerously in this tournament so far ? and secondly , there was a point at 23 in the second set , a long point , and what were you thinking before and after that point ? things seemed to shift in that moment .
what do you think about the changes the olympics made regarding fed cup play , affecting players who have a hectic schedule as it is ?
all these long matches , do they get you battle tested or are you worried about running out of gas at this point ? what 's the tradeoff there ?
obviously a great start for you to the match . do you think anything made that change or was it her finding her range more ?
from our perspective , it looked like a pretty highquality match . how did you feel about the strokes out there with serena today ?
overall , 2015 french open , diary entry for sloane stephens , how would it go ?
did you surprise yourself with your bouncebackability ?
now that you 've been back with nick for a while and stuff , can you just talk about how it seems to be working well ? does it seem like there was never a break , like it was always with nick ? just talk about that .
i know you always talk about the selfbelief , but why do you say you would be surprised or happy with this result from a couple weeks ago or a couple months ago ?
i have a multiple question . how do you rate the interest of people in the usa for tennis among the huge sports you have ? and for instance personally , are you famous there ? do people stop you in the street ? i want to have your impression about this .
you 're not the only player , but when you have had a lot of success in the juniors and then when you come out and you have really early , great success as a younger player , that that kind of situation does n't prepare you necessarily thinking how hard it actually is going to be to find a steady momentum and move up , that because you 're young and enthusiastic you do n't realize that ?
how much better did serena play toward the end than she was playing at the beginning ?
you had a better a closer view .
it did n't feel different , or did it ?
you kind of touched on this , but how much does this motivate you ? i know there is a fire within , but to have this experience and be out there on chatrier , like you said , does this sort of reignite that fire ?
you sound so believable there .
you talked about having the joy or this fire . it maybe always was n't visible from the outside . it seems more visible now . so have you been working on showcasing the fire wherever it was , better , you think ?
maria was in here . she said you have improved so much . you 're more consistent than maybe few years ago , playing so fast . have you got this feeling in the last couple of three years you really improved again and ...
you had to be very consistent mentally , very strong . did you doubt ?
beating the world no.2 , taking out a defending champion , you 're probably going to be in the top 10 making your first quarterfinal . many things . how are you able to take this all in but without getting too excited , because you still have a match ?
in the first part of both sets you seemed to hit your forehand really well . you hit your forehand well throughout the match , but you did a lot of rallies where you went crosscourt , crosscourt , and sometimes you stuck in a short angle to her backhand . you did that more than usual . was that part of your game plan or did it just come right then , right there ?
as you said , you used the short angle from your forehand quite often today , which is very efficient . could you talk advantage of being lefty , especially on this clay court ?
you have already big wins in grand slams and big disappointments like li na in melbourne . was it always easy to believe you could beat these players ? you could go quarters , semis ? we keep saying you have a lot of potential and a lot of talent . is it really easy to still keep going ?
when the top seeds in your half of the draw are going out , do you notice what 's happening like in the other matches , or are you just focused on what 's happening for your next match ?
obviously in your first main draw appearance here in roland garros . overall what do you take from the experience ?
after beating pliskova in the second round , did you feel you had any more pressure on you after that win ?
and you 're projected to hopefully crack the top 50 after this run . is this a goal you had set for yourself , or have you exceeded your expectations ?
it was a good start for you obviously in the first set , and then what do you think changed the rest of the match ?
does that feel like a big missed opportunity for you when you look at the draw , when you look at you were playing well coming to this tournament ?
what is it that she does well ? i mean , there is a lot of people who maybe have n't seen timea play before . you have obviously seen her twice this year . what is it she does that causes you problems ?
mentally and physically how do you feel heading into the grass season now considering it 's one of your favorite parts of the year ?
are you excited about a threeweek grass season ? adding any extra tournaments this year ? seems like an opportunity if you want to .
on monday you will be no.2 in the rankings ; first time since 2012. it 's likely that that will probably get you a no.2 seed , i would think , at wimbledon . what 's your reaction to both of those , just being back up at no.2 ? and also , is it important to be seeded no.2 possibly across the draw from serena ?
as the sun started to go down and the temperature dropped out there , did you notice any change of conditions ? was it more difficult for you to hit through the court , or was that just timea playing better ?
what do you think was the key to turning around that match so quickly in your favor in the second ?
have you surprised yourself at all at what you 've done for the last week , week and a half here in paris ? what are your kind of overall emotions after a big win like this ?
going back to two years ago when you came here for qualifying , did you have any thought that now , just two years later , you 'd be in the quarterfinals at least ?
you said that you continue to surprise yourself every day . i 'm wondering , what is it exactly you 're surprised about ? your quality ? that you are even on the court ? that these wins , you are getting the results ? what is surprising ?
as surprised as you are to be here , i 'm guessing your next opponent is even more surprised . i do n't know if you know who are you playing . alison . what are your thoughts on that and this sort of opportunity that the two of you have in this quarterfinal against each other ?
that 's not as good an expression in english .
i turned to commentators before the match , and they told me that her ranking does n't reflect her level , but she does n't know about her level because her level is quite big . have you noticed that you 've improved significantly ?
so you did n't serve well in the first set ; you tried to move . is it because you started the match at 7:30 p.m. , the court was empty , totally different to the ambience and atmosphere of the day ? was it difficult to handle that , this late start ?
so you mentioned being relaxed . on court from the outside we are under the impression that you 're relaxed with these good results . how can you be relaxed ? because you have to manage your emotions and feelings ; first quarterfinal in a grand slam tournament . we are under the impression that you are used to pressure from the outside .
you surprised at that scoreline ? with all the matches you 're played and everything , i do n't know if you expected it to be so straightforward .
are you surprised you were able to play what was the best match now this deep in the tournament ?
go back to the end of last year . obviously serena next , but you played exceptionally well against her the first time you played . did everything work that day ?
going to try and replicate that game plan from then tomorrow ?
have you learned anything about yourself over the course of the last two , three weeks ? taking four weeks off after wimbledon and then the last couple of weeks on court , what have you ...
how often do you watch serena ?
no ?
you mentioned you 're relaxed and refreshed . given that and your results the last two weeks , is this maybe what you might look to do next year , maybe take a tournament or two off that you 'd planned on playing because you come back refreshed and playing so well ?
how comforting is it to have darren come out there and have him tell you you 're doing everything well ?
what makes you guys get along ?
going back to you watching roger play , do you take any aspects and elements ...
what does it mean to `` pull a serena '' ? if you could define that for you us , we 'd appreciate it .
reel off 6 straight games ?
sounds like you were pretty happy with that final set that you played , but can you talk about the first two sets and what was maybe not going great for you and how you were able to turn it around ?
you talked about a little bit of rust in canada . all credit to ana in the first set as you mentioned . if you were playing the full schedule and did n't have that rust , do you think you would have won that first set today ?
was there anything extra in this match just because you played ana for the championship here last year ?
you said you did a serena .
i know . i 'm just wondering , does it surprise you on any level when you do that , when you are yourself , or are you just used to doing it ?
yeah .
it 's already in there .
what are you feeling when you get on a roll like you did ? it 's got to feel really good that everything is going well for you and just rolling . how does that feel ?
when specifically did you feel it on that roll , in particular ?
obviously a tough match . you talked about being poised on the court . how happy were you today with how positive you were able to stay in such a tough match ?
on espn you said that was the best six games you had played this summer . what specifically were you happy with ? and do you think that it kind of now you 're kind of us open preparation your us open preparation clicks in ?
back there or clicked ?
are there points in a match when you go into serena drive ? you kind of flip that switch , that you actively say , i 'm going to take it to the next level ?
talk about the match . how did it trend towards the end there ?
what do you think it is about your game that seems to trouble her and has troubled her the last couple of years ? what do you do particularly well ?
after you won the first set were you feeling , i 'm almost there ?
physically when did you start to feel it ? it looked like you were kind of laboring through the third set .
yesterday with that long match you had with sloane , did that take anything out of you for today , do you think ?
going into newyork , how is your confidence right now ?
on the subject of nigel , obviously you have had some results with him and moved on to other coaches . what made you decide to come back to him ?
do you think in newyork that women will have a feel of an added incentive to try to stop serena ?
are you concerned at all about kind of the fading in the third set , the physicality issues ?
is there a time between now and the offseason where you wo n't be able to have a training block , or are you already looking at the offseason like that 's when it 's going to happen ?
are you managing expectations then for the rest of the year , or are your expectations and the pressure ...
serena talked yesterday about not playing stanford and was a little rusty in canada , did n't have the matches , and then obviously coming here . you have played her a number of times , but were there areas of her game that maybe were n't working as well against you that really did in the past when you played her today ?
on the subject of your training block , iptl coming in , how will you fit that in as well as prepare for the following season ?
you brought a lot of power to the game when you started coming up . is it hard to figure out how far to go trying to keep up with the williams sisters , serena in particular ?
do you ever fight not getting too bulky ?
your favorite memory of playing fed cup for serbia ?
i never watched the iptl , because it was like payperview here , but understand that if you toss up the ball you have to hit it .
was that a problem ?
did you get used to that shot clock thing and the countdown ?
we have to ask about the eighth game in the second set . do n't go through all of it , but the highlights .
with sloane , she 's incredibly fast and a good athlete , moves around the court , and has effortless power . how do you hurt her ? how do you hurt her ? what 's the game plan against her ?
with you coaching the last couple of years , do you feel that much more settled now ?
after that game , do you really need him ? you managed to find it from within .
serena next .
talking about serena , people think she hits the ball harder than everybody else , but obviously you have played her many times and you know ...
obviously you are popular anywhere , but even though you played against an american today you got a lot of support here . any thoughts on the support here ?
this was your first match of the week . how difficult is it , you know , not playing until thursday when everybody else is still playing ?
speaking of serbian fans , how do you compare how some of the fan support from your countrymen and countrywomen was back in 2006 , 2007 , 2008 , compared to how it is now ?
you always are very complimentary about serena . you respect her quite a bit . is there ever a concern that that respect is detrimental , having to take the court and playing against her and competing ?
could you just talk about the injury ? is it a precaution to stop or something that really bothered you ? how do you feel for the open ?
do you plan on playing new haven next week ?
what 's the nature of the injury ?
what is the nature of your injury ?
has it been bothering you for quite a while , or is it something that just cropped up recently ?
you have been playing a lot lately . do you feel like physically and mentally it was becoming a little too much ?
kept your composure . you were down . there was rain .
the level , not your best tennis but playing well enough to win again and again . was that sort of what you were feeling out there ?
how did you feel about your net approaches today ?
no , but you were moving in . taking chances . they did n't all turn out great , but ...
are you enjoying the battle ? was it fun ?
on a scale of 1 to 10 , how would you rate your competitiveness ? are you super competitive in every single thing you do ...
always have been ?
some friends you have had for a long time and you have n't seen them for ages , but you 're there and you click right back in . other friends you have you have to warm back up to them . what is it like with coaches ? what 's it like with nick ?
so you worked with him before and did n't work with him for a while . do you have to warm each other up or ...
do you have to warm up before you start clicking again ?
( indiscernible . )
i was talking to your good friend mallory burdette a couple weeks ago in stanford and she says hi . but she was saying that when she was working with nick , you know , a lot of those lessons about competing and battling and not being able to control the result , all these sort of messages he was telling her when she was younger , i ca n't deal with this right now , i ca n't accept it as like a fact ?
so like the jumping off point about clicking , was that one of the things when you started working with him at the beginning of the year and beginning of the season , kind of hearing these same messages you were back in the day ? it took you kind of time to embrace it and internalize it ?
is your mom here ?
traveling you with you less this year ?
it 's all support ?
ivanovic ?
we 'll fill in all the blanks .
that 's a quality win over a tough opponent . talk about it .
was winning a title important to you , and does it make you feel any different as a tennis player ?
atp ?
but obviously you have gone deep in majors . can you compare and contrast those levels of satisfaction , or was it , yay , we 're moving on ?
what makes you feel really satisfied ?
that 's tennis , right ?
have your grandparents got the trophy yet ?
( indiscernible . )
you have had some close calls prior to getting the title in washington . you did get it and you said you have already moved on . at that point in time was there a sense of relief of winning ?
do you think there is a level of clarity in terms of like your game plan these days and what you feel like you need to do on the court and what is like the right thing for sloane stephens to play or what 's comfortable for you ?
was there like a switch that was flipped or something when that happened , or just positive reinforcement of , okay , i 'm winning matches playing this way , so just keep doing this ?
you mentioned getting that feeling . was there a point in the year that specifically you really started to feel better and having that confidence on court and the results started coming ?
gradual ?
is your service something you have been working on ?
talk about your serve . you have a bigger serve . it 's becoming a weapon . you really go for it on the first serve , definitely .
a lot more players are using headphones on the court now , men and women both , the big , whatever . have you ever thought about doing that ?
why do you like doing that ?
a lot of people used to do that and then took them off before walking on . do you have thoughts why you take them off after you 're already on court ?
couple years ago when you went into newyork you talked about the onslaught and the people and the chaos . is that still sort of the feeling you bring when you go there , or has that changed ?
sounds terrifying .
managing that part of the way you succeed , then ?
in terms of managing hecticness , does playing new haven kind of the calm before the storm ?
( question regarding sponsors . )
what 's it feel like to be on a campus like that ?
he 's going to be a senior this year ?
where do you want him to go ?
how difficult was it to play your biggest match ever on sunday night and tuesday you have to start all over again ?
how did you feel about your game today ?
did you feel the crowd support ? i heard a lot of cheering for you in the crowd ?
you have played fed cup quite a bit as a youngster . how much has that experience helped get you where you are today ?
congratulations on your victory . please tell us how was to beat in backtoback matches serena and also in the final simona halep ?
as a result of winning in canada , have you readjusted your goals for the year ?
at what point did you know you were playing angelique ?
did that play into your mind at all , higher caliber player like that coming out of the gates ...
will you take time out to celebrate your win ?
can you talk about how martina hingis has helped you throughout your career and become the player you are today ?
how are you feeling about your season so far ?
how are you feeling just day to day and mentally ? obviously you have come a long way since last year .
what was the process ?
diet ? gluten ? other things ?
anything else you can share about it ?
canada or somewhere else ?
with respect to the process and gradual process , do you have a time frame where you want to hit to where you 're back to where you are or where you feel confident about winning tournaments and majors ?
given that obviously every match is different and every day in practice you 're working on things you have played serena very tough this year do you look at that as sort of a barometer of where your game is ?
how serious is the leg injury , or is that just for protection ?
does n't look like it 's hampering you . looks like you were moving pretty decent today .
do you feel that you get great preparation here ? you won it a couple years ago . is that feeling coming back to you while you 're on court ?
can you talk about some of your fed cup experiences recently and some of your teammates ?
you 're one of the players who pushed serena consistently this year . do you look at that as a way of seeing how close you are to being back to where you want to be ?
can you also talk about your recent move from lagardre to img ?
will there be dancing involved ?
i think a couple years ago you were here talking about doing something with a shirt and the clothing company really liked it . are you still designing clothes ?
can you just talk about caro ? you have had success so far .
congratulations . how are you feeling after only one match ? how are you feeling about your form for this weekend and longer term ?
is there anything you do differently now during a long delay that you might have not done before ?
talk about some of the selftalk . say you have a massive lead in the first set and you start to lose it . what do you say to yourself to get back on track ?
you mentioned that you do n't worry about form so much anymore . i assume because of the condition you 've had to deal with , but yet you still show tremendous athleticism . first game in the second set , you got to an awful lot in that game . what allows you to overcome those physical problems to maintain that at this age ?
i know your goal is obviously to win in new york , but what are your , i guess , expectations going into the slam ?
do you have any more confidence there since new york has been good to you historically ?
does this tournament serve as a good precursor to the open for you ?
second serve seems a little different . have you been tinkering with it to get more impact , i guess ?
i have a question about your legacy . so there is the movement cohort of the original nine in women 's tennis , and then the bridge cohort of evert/navratilova and that group , and then you 're in the professional cohort . are you a throwback to the previous generations where you 're doing activism as well as being an athlete .
pam shriver told me you were a throwback . i thought , interesting . i 'm going to have to ask . or maybe you 're moving it forward like a new cohort that 's going to be an activist and athletic .
i have a friend who found an old copy she had of the tennis monthly recap . i 'm wondering what you remember about that and your first thoughts looking back on that now ?
do you remember what sort of software you used or something like that ?
i 'm here from new york writing a story prior to the open . i was wondering , within your family , what 's the sense of anticipation at the circumstances of serena having a shot to make the grand slam ? how important is that ?
and as people though , one of the hallmarks of what the two of you have achieved has a lot to do with mental toughness , and you referred to that earlier . how critical do you feel that 's been to get this level of success ?
that was , in some circles , a fairly anticipated rematch . what were you thinking when you saw the draw , when you saw who the qualifier was ? what did you have on your mind today ?
what were you thinking out there as the match progressed ?
you did that .
you did n't seem to have too much trouble more or less there ?
) question regarding something to prove . )
especially against her .
if you had n't been so in control of the match and if there were some antics from her end , would you be tempted to ...
more mature than her or more mature than two years ago ?
why does it get under your skin so much ?
that being said , what do you make of what 's been going on on the other side of the tour in the last week or so ?
( question regarding confidence level . )
( indiscernible . )
when there is a match that is contentious or there is a history , i think a lot of people look forward to the handshake , what it will be like . when you 're on court and you win that match and you 're walking towards the net , are you holding your breath seeing what 'll happen ?
do you feel then with your preparation for the hard courts that you 're playing catchup a little bit ?
next match thoughts ?
safarova .
must be an unbelievable feeling right now . can you describe the emotions getting to this point from the start of the day ? what do you think of the term 'serena slam ' now ?
how can you make the mental switch after a tough roland garros ?
you come across to us as kind of ageless .
do you notice any difference in your body or your ability , work ethic , from years ago ?
can you give us a word on garbine muguruza and what you see for her future ?
you 've won 88 % in the first five rounds , 87 % in the last five rounds . you 're basically just as good against the best players in semis and finals as earlier . why do you think that is ?
i know you stay in the present or do your best to stay in the present ...
when did you first think of new york or have you not maybe ?
could you give us a bit of detail ? when you said you reinvented your workouts ? i 've been reinventing mine for a long time .
what 's the latest you 've done ?
any particular style ?
describe that a bit to me . i do n't do that , i 'm too old .
when you were dancing around centre court after you won , you thought of new york , what were you thinking ?
what 's been the key of winning four majors in a row ?
what has this process of the serena slam , what has it taught you about yourself ?
after the last point of the match , there was a pause . it seemed like there was a little bit of confusion as to what was happening . what did you think was happening in that moment ? what did it feel like ?
there 's a lot of aspects to this victory , history made . 21 , six wimbledons , serena slam . what speaks loudest to you ?
with all that you 've achieved , with what you might achieve in the future , what do you consider the toughest thing to accomplish ?
how do you do it ?
throughout the match today , at any stage did you feel or think , i 'm going to lose this ?
which one was the toughest , this one or watson ?
it 's been a long time in tennis , 27 years , since we 've had someone going to new york with a chance to win the grand slam . a lot of attention and hype . what are you expecting from that ?
in terms of alltime great sporting accomplishments , how much are you able to put into perspective what you 're in the midst of ?
you mentioned your coach . what has he brought to everything that you do that you did n't have before ?
is it difficult to get to that position ? easy to say . how difficult is it to keep that focus all year round ?
it took you some time before you were finally able to win one more wimbledon than venus . i 'd like to know to remind you with your age , there will be somebody that tomorrow could be 33 years old and win wimbledon . do you think that is probable or difficult ?
roger . another guy who is same age as you . he may win wimbledon , too . is it probable ?
favorite or not ?
you wear very pretty outfits the days after and the parties . when you 're choosing the outfit , did you have doubts , if i do n't win , i 'll wear that outfit someplace else ?

what do you remember , though , about when you were first on this stage and what you need to overcome that she might be going through now ?

can you describe how hard it is when she 's serving 120 up the middle , then can serve out wide also ?
how much thought have you given to radical changes and tactics when you play her ?
i do n't know . since things have not worked for the last number of matches , what thoughts have you given to making really drastic changes in your approach to playing her tactically ?
how about as far as positioning against her serve , what was your approach today ?
when you 're in baseline rallies with her , do you feel even ? is she physically stronger there , too ?
you 're a huge competitor . you hate losing . what is the mindset because it seems like it hurts more than previous ones ?

getting closer to beating her .
patrick mouratoglou was quoted saying that victoria azarenka was a much better player than you . what is your response to that ?
why do you think that is ?
obviously they showed the videos from 2004. that was 11 years ago . you 've enjoyed a long career , longer than henin , clijsters . do you think you 'd still be here if you did n't have the shoulder injury that maybe drove you to continue for a longer period of time ?
you 've enjoyed a longer career than most players .
do you think if you enjoyed the success of 2004 without any obstacles , you 'd still be here today ?
my question is also about your injury , which obviously was a devastating one . few if any others have ever come back from an injury like that . overall , how do you think that has impacted your level of play on court , stroke production , so forth ?
after these repeated losses to serena , do you ever think to yourself , is there a coach perhaps , other than richard williams , that can get you past her ?
what 's your general reaction after that match ?
could you talk us through what happened right at the end from your point of view . was your box telling you to challenge ?
she started so well . how do you feel you came back into the match ?
the turning points in the second and third sets . more question of mental doubts or tactical things in the game ?
how do you compare garbine 's game against serena 's or sharapova 's as far as how hard that ball is coming at you ? were you surprised how she handled the late moments of coming through under pressure ?
even though you lost , do n't you think there 's a lot to cheer because you made arguably the semifinals of the best grand slam of the year ?
tactically can you explain a little bit about what your game plan was going into the match . also around the second set , tactically you started to switch things up a little bit , keep the ball a little bit lower to her . can you give us some insight into how you wanted to play that match .
she said she was pretty nervous in the second set . were you nervous , too ? i know you 've been at this stage several times before , but it 's been a while .
can i clarify on the challenge at the end , did you hear a shout urging you to challenge or had you made the decision to challenge it ?
after the start to your year , this is obviously a great result for you . what do you think about this result looking forward ? do you think it could be the spark for your year ?
when you dropped out of the top 10 earlier this year , you sent out a tweet to kind of laugh about it . yes , okay , i get it , i 've dropped out of the top 10. now that you 're back into the top 10 , how much does that actually matter to you ?
you and martina navratilova split up earlier this year . i understand she was helping you a little bit here these two weeks .
do you think garbine can win the title here ?
what does it mean to you to be in the wimbledon final ?
it should be mentioned sometime back you were having problems with your knees . now you 're in the finals of wimbledon . you got a text from conchita . could you tell us about that text .
yes .
did she give you any tips about the finals ?
have you surprised yourself at how well you 've played on grass here ?
you 're now on your longest run on grass . your last run was 'shertogenbosch coming into today . what has been the difference between two years ago and now ?
speaking of mental toughness , the momentum seemed to shift significantly in the second set . you got it back again . can you describe how you managed to regain your composure there ?
did she change the tactics on you , try to make you run more ? what did you feel she was doing differently ?
last year after your win against serena in paris , someone was asking you if you are more famous in venezuela or spain . you said , i 'm not famous at all . same question now .
how would you describe serena williams , and what would be the challenge for you if it is serena in the final ?
what is it about her that makes her one of the best ever in your mind ?
where have your parents been watching from ? are you going to have to tell them to stay away now ?
they 're in barcelona ?
are they going to come ?
can you tell us some things about yourself away from tennis that you like to do ? for example , do you like football or cooking ?
you talk a lot about your poker face , your need to keep a poker face . how hard is that for you ? why do you feel the need to keep it kind of all kept in ?
this is your first big run at wimbledon , but you 've had the big runs at the french open . how have those taught you about yourself and how to handle the pressure , the media pressure , and how to handle a grand slam coming into the later stages ?
you 're very calm in a great way in this situation . deep down inside , what are you trying to find ? obviously a final is a whole different story . what are you going to try to dig deep in and try to find that maybe you have n't had before ?
emotionally , what do you want to get out of yourself ? this is going to be the stage of all time for you .
you have many challenges now , even if you want to think only about sunday . sanchez and martinez winning a lot . the top spanish players are getting older . nadal , ferrer , robredo . do you see yourself in a way to be able to replace the image of all these players who may end their career while you are taking off ?
talk a little bit about changing your tactics and game . obviously something aga does well and did in that match . do you have a good planb when plan a is not working ?
you 've often said you enjoy playing maria sharapova . that will come in the next round . do you approach playing victoria azarenka in the same way ?
what do you feel made the difference today ? obviously a very highquality match . victoria was saying you pretty much won a set just on aces .
was that as well as you feel like you can serve , especially towards the end of the match ? do you feel like you were relying on those big serves to come through for you ?
you put on a very highquality match out there , very entertaining . caroline wozniacki said she did n't think enough of the women 's matches were on the main courts . do you agree with her with that ?
what do you mean you made progress ?
caroline said a lot of the women feel the same way . is there an agreement among the women ?
as far as the match with maria goes , it 's wellknown you 're not the best of friends , as it were . people call it a grudge match . i suppose it actually has to be even sided for it to be a grudge match . you have n't lost to her in 11 years . how are you feeling about it ?
when you step on centre court and are pursuing the championship here , what is the connection that you feel with the game 's greats who have preceded you , althea gibson , billie jean king , steffi graf and the others ?
when you see your name on the trophy , and it 's there a lot , what is the connection you feel with the people who preceded you ? what is the feeling in general ?
you 're having all this fantastic success . do you ever say to yourself , this is kind of fun ? are you enjoying the process ?
does that help you to relax on court and know everything is going to be okay no matter what ?
at different stages in the match , the crowd actually started laughing quite loudly about some of the grunting on the court . do you find that distracting when you 're actually playing ?
do you feel it 's disrespectful ?
victoria said it seemed a bit unfair because she was training next to nadal the other day and said he grunts much louder than she does . it seems like it 's something that happens when women play rather than the men .
i hope this is n't controversial . when you get into a third set , do you feel as though you ca n't lose at this point ?
the match , you did n't really have a chance to have ups and downs in this match because she was very on . how hard was it for you to be focused in every point ? you had to dig in deep . i think it 's one of the best matches i 've seen you play .
it was consistent with no ups and downs .
you had a great moment at the net with victoria . talk a little bit about how you and victoria get on off the court , a few words about her and her comeback this year .
muguruza was not that wellknown when she beat you in paris . she 's in the semifinals here . did you see anything in her game at that point that made you thing she would be a shortlist great player at that time or did it feel like out of nowhere ?
how would you describe the inspiration that you draw from the historic figures in women 's tennis , from the people we 've discussed before like billie jean , althea gibson and others ?
you said you 're in the moment . during a big tournament like wimbledon , what are the things you do to stay in the moment ?
threehour match . how would you sum up the fight you had out there ? first time playing in that sort of occasion for you .
what was it like walking onto centre court ? did you take a moment to take it in or was it just all about the match for you ?
it seems as though it 's quite noisy out there . how did you deal with that ? was it a distraction , hearing the grunts from the other side of the net ?
her .
when you spoke to the umpire at 31 ...
what did she say ?
did you ?
did you think she was scared to talk to maria ?
how would you describe this experience here during the fortnight for you , and what does it tell you about your future ?
obviously she can be an intimidating presence out there . you are n't easily intimidated . i know you had problems with your serves . all in all , do you think there was any nervousness in playing her specifically ?
so at no point did you say anything directly to maria about it ?
do you think she heard you when you were talking to the umpire ?
after this , i know it just ended , but how much are you looking forward to the us open ?
it was pretty good theater today . what are some of the plays that you 've enjoyed ?
do you think some umpires struggle to speak to the bigname players ?
do you get a sense of that ?
you did today , though ?
this obviously has been a big run for you . but you 've kind of said it did n't faze you a lot . was there a moment out there that you felt like , this is motivation to go further in my career , i 'm battling with maria for a chance in the semifinals of wimbledon ?
how do you reckon you sustained the enthusiasm , determination and optimism you 've had here ?
was there anything you learned from this going forward ? anything surprise you about grand slam quarterfinals ?
i know you say that maria 's grunts did n't distract you . were there any other aspects of her game , other than her moving during your service , that you found a distraction or you thought was on the boundaries of the way the sport should be gone about ?
how many family members did you have here ?
what other times , if any , had you experienced where a player was moving during your serve motion , and how have you reacted on those occasions ?
then here , what was your immediate reaction when you first saw maria doing this ?
you 've been talking the last few days about how much you 've been working on your physical training . how much do you think that helped you in a match like this ? how much confidence does that give you ?
not too many people have the experience of going up against serena and maria . could you talk about how the two differ and what it 's like . secondly , how would you respond to people who said , hey , moving during a second serve is legal , it 's okay ?
yesterday caroline wozniacki spoke about a lot of the women 's matches being staged sort of on the edges rather than on the big stages . do you agree with that ? do you think the women 's game has been slightly moved aside ?
did you find out how your brother got his ticket to get here ?
getting to the semis , you have to be pleased . is there any part of the game as we move on in the semis you would like to be concentrating more ?
coco complained a few times to the chair umpire she thought you were moving her during service motion . did you hear her saying that ?
did you feel like you were doing anything different than you usually do on your return ?
she actually said what you did was unsportsmanlike . how do you react to that ?
what does knowing the history of wimbledon and the women who were here before you , whether it be as far back as althea gibson , billie jean king , steffi graf , all those players , what does that mean to you ? are there players from whom you take specific images and memories ?
when you 've seen your name on that trophy with these greatest names in the history of the sport , what are the feelings that that evokes for you ?
is there a special feeling coming back to the semifinal here ?
how crucial is that third week of grass gap between the french and wimbledon for you ? would you be here now without that third week ?
were there times when you were still getting better that you thought wimbledon might not be your year this year ?
you 'll play serena possibly . how exciting is that ?
do you feel in yourself that you 're playing really well ? you 're having some struggles in matches which is absolutely normal . how do you feel your tennis is ?
when you 've seen vika go through the injuries she has , you know your own experience , what goes through your mind as you 've watched her progression from being at her lowest point to where she is today ?
when you played serena here 11 years ago , you were a big underdog . you would be an underdog again this time . anything about your mindset going into that match 11 years ago that you can rekindle or is it so far long ago ?
11 years is a very long time . do you ever find yourself replaying memories of 2004 , when you were on centre court ? is it a feeling that you 're very restless to recapture ?
what do you say to people who are critical of how vocal you are and the noise you make on court ? quite a reaction on twitter today as there generally is . what do you say to that ?
it 's up to you .
you have a pretty special rivalry with azarenka . if it 's vika in the semifinal , what do you think of it ?
after roland garros , did you see yourself so few weeks later in the semifinal of a slam ?
is it just a matter of the change in surface or is there something different that you 're doing while you 're here in terms of your game that 's helping you get these results ?
you still did n't expect the semifinal ?
you have had the experience of being here at wimbledon , standing on centre court for the final . what would it mean to you to be back there with the chance to see your name on the trophy ?
are there any images that you take with you that inspire you when you walk out on the court here ?
madison hit 45 winners against you , but you were able to get an awful lot back . how would you rate her in terms of her game ?
when you 're playing someone as aggressive as madison , how hard is it to think you 're controlling the match ? do you feel sometimes you have control and sometimes you do n't ?
it was a bit of the struggle at the start of the year in terms of consistency and results . how disappointing was it when the coaching relationship with martina did n't work out ?
what is it about this particular period that 's really sort of come together for you ? you got to the final of eastbourne . you 've had a good run here . how much do you think experience is going to help when you meet muguruza ?
you played well in the leadup tournaments , but overall do you think you played this tournament with a little bit less pressure than when you 've come here as a top five player ?
muguruza has beaten you your last two matches that you 've played . is she the favorite ?
i 'm interested if you know about your followers in venezuela ?
you have a big following in venezuela ?
are you surprised this came here at wimbledon ? you made the french open quarterfinals twice before . are you at all surprised that your first semifinal is at wimbledon ?
how did you find it out there today ?
how did you find being out on the big court ? secondly , yesterday caroline wozniacki said there are too few women 's matches on the big courts here . do you agree ?
what does the opportunity to make history mean to you ?
so many great players have been on centre court at wimbledon . billie jean king , martina navratilova , steffi graf , many others . who are some of the others you have admired most who have played at centre court at wimbledon and what are your images of them ?
what does centre court at wimbledon mean to you , though ?
did antonio banderas have any words for you when you met him in the dining room ?
who are the great players in women 's tennis history who have had an impact on you and what are some of the things that you 've drawn from them ?
can you be more specific ? what are some of those little parts and who are the players ?
you beat a couple of top10 players in earlier rounds . in the bottom half there are no top10 players left . does that influence your thinking going into the next couple matches of playing somebody who has n't won a grand slam before , does n't have that much to their name ?
what do you think of both keys and radwanska ?
when you see the wimbledon championship trophy , what goes through your mind ?
what was the difference in that match today ?
when you look at the stat sheet , you have so many more winners than her and so many more unforced errors . does it feel like the game is on your racquet with her or does it feel she 's still in control of things also ?
is that a match you think you should have won ?
is there anything you would have done differently with hindsight , looking back at the match ?
what did you think of your opponent ? her defense is so remarkable . she 's tough for any opponent in that regard .
you won more points than her . but 40 unforced errors is quite a total , was n't it ?
you 're obviously a wonderful talent , improving all the time . semifinals in australia , quarters here . what is the plan to take it to the next level ?
what are you most pleased about with your two weeks at wimbledon , and what are you most disappointed about ?
what are the things that you learned to win when things are n't going so well ?
three slams now for the year . feeling pretty good about your performances at them ? are you pleased overall with that run ?
how about the internal dialogue compared to a couple years ago in big matches ? how do you feel you 're doing with that ? is it a different sort of place you 're in during a match ?
is that particularly difficult against a player like radwanska ? does she really test your patience with those defensive skills ?
how is your summer shaping up schedulewise ? what are you expecting after all these big things you 're doing overseas ? what will the us open be like ?
stanford ?
you said you want more . what does that mean in your own mind ?
you were out on one of the two biggest courts today . tell us how that felt . secondly , caroline wozniacki yesterday said she felt the women do not play enough matches on the two big courts , too many men 's games . do you agree ?
despite today 's result , this has been a big comeback for you . did you enjoy wimbledon this year all in all ?
it was a match today of such small margins . what do you think was the difference in the end ?
why do you think it did n't happen today when it has been happening for you so much ? you 've had such a good winning record . do you think maybe there 's been an element of some fatigue and tiredness ? was there anything different today ?
how did you feel about that ? it was obviously a highquality match .
what did you feel was the difference ? you mentioned that 's why serena has done what she 's done in the game . what is that kind of quality ?
how do you feel about your own form ? you seem back to nearly where you were when you won the australian open twice . do you feel a little bit more to get to serena 's level ?
you know when you 're playing her , she 's probably going to lift her level . did she surprise you at all today at her highest points or not ?
can you say it even a little bit further . there were breathless points out there , athletic , corner to corner . what went through your mind as you saw the level get so high ?
you said you 're the type of player that 's not going to give up , try to find a way to beat serena williams . what do you do now ? do you go back and look at the video , take lessons from that ?
we saw in the final set , even when you were 3love down , you were pumping yourself up . did you sort of still believe there was a way back ?
the problem you were worried about before the tournament , did that pose any problem to you during the tournament ?
the crowd was reacting to both your sounds and serena 's sounds . i do n't know if you noticed that . when serena raises her volume on big points like that , are you aware of that or you do n't even hear her ?
i appreciate what you 're saying , but did you find it distracting from the crowd ? they were actually laughing during points . i think it was directed at both you and serena . they 're laughing while the point is being played . did you find that distracting ?
the hug that you shared with serena at the end of the match , was that in part recognition for the high standard of the match ?
how does it work in terms of that setpoint call in paris which you were not happy with ? are you upset about that for a few hours ? does it still piss you off ?
serena does n't like to talk about the grand slam she 's going for , a chance to win all four . from your perspective , what do you make of what she 's trying to do , what it would be like if you were to play her at the us open trying to stop her from getting all four ?
if you had to give one tip to maria sharapova facing serena williams in the next round , what would it be ?
you have your stats there . how do you think you played ?
how do you think you played today ?
do you enjoy playing venus ?
what do you hope for the future as far as the possibilities of playing with venus on such a grand stage ?
when you were interviewed when you came off the court , you said you did n't know how many more opportunities there will be . what are your thoughts about that and the future for opportunities ?
for the future , what do you hope there will be given you 're both playing at such a high level right now ?
now that it 's over , did you dread facing her this early in the tournament , with all the stuff around it , the grand slam possibility , and she seemed to be playing pretty well ?
seeing how venus has come back and what you 've seen from her today , what can you expect from her ?
do you head out there trying to tell yourself that you 're not playing venus , you 're just playing another opponent ? has your thinking about that changed over the years from when you first played her ?
where do you feel you are emotionally and physically at this point ? you had a tough match with heather , then facing venus in the fourth round . there 's all this pomp and circumstance . do you feel you 'll recover well for tomorrow ?
i remember you saying in paris at this point in the tournament , you have an idea of what else is going on in the tournament . the top half of this draw has been strong . how does it feel when you 're in a tournament that looks lopsided from the outside , more opportunities in some parts than others ?
this is the first time in over 10 years we 've had three american women in the quarters here , coco and madison making it through . thoughts on getting some support late in the tournament ?
how much of an internal struggle was it for you in that final game to make the challenge ? it seemed like both of you throughout the match were reluctant to make the challenge . as i asked venus , she said she used to beat you quite a lot when you were younger . did you ever cheat on the line calling to move it your way when you were a kid ?
is that yes ?
the serve was well out . you seemed to pause before you challenged .
how does it make you feel when you hear some of the younger generation , the next generation of american players , talk about the inspiration they 've drawn from you and venus ?
venus said afterwards you looked in pretty good shape to win this tournament . she said it 's going to take something pretty special to beat you . what are your thoughts on that ?
it 's said of siblings , like bob and mike , you and venus , that they know the next move , the next tendency . talk about being so close to venus , sensing what she 's going to do off court and on court .
what shot do you particularly know ?

how would you sum up your game today ? good ? bad ?
do you ever look forward to playing serena in any tournament ?
does that make you think when you 're contemplating your life and the hand you 've been dealt , that if it was n't for this woman called serena williams , there may have been many more finals and grand slams to your name ?
so looking forward , your sister was interviewed when she walked off the court and she said she thought about the fact that there may not be that many more opportunities on the grandest of stages to have matchups with you . what are your thoughts of playing against and with serena ?
you and serena have had an incredible run . has there been one time when you 've ever been upset with serena or annoyed with her ? can you share something on the human side , please ?
do you fight ?
aside from fighting , does she not do the dishes ? does she leave music on loud ? something somewhere ?

fans of him have taken to putting chocolate on their face . do you think that 's an appropriate thing for fans to do ?
you said she was playing really well , serena today . do you think she 's playing well enough now to win this tournament ? is she looking in good shape to win now ?

has that changed at all over the years , the way you view a matchup against her ?
what do you hope your matches with serena will be remembered for , and what do you hope your respective careers will be remembered for ?
what do you think serena has shown with the way she 's conducted herself and the way she 's performed ?

when you were kids , did you think that serena would get 20 slams ?
i wonder if you spoke to your dad and your mom before this game ? what did they say to you ?

you 've obviously had illnesses , and fought back . where do you think you are now physically compared to , say , a year or two or three years ago ? looks like you 're having a bit of a renaissance , is that fair ?
yes . you 're top 16 again . top 10 is n't out of the question .
congratulations . quarterfinals .
felt pretty good out there ?
does that make it an even better upset for you if you were n't playing what you felt was best , and obviously she 's ...
if you were upset with yourself , you hit it pretty well . watching , you were smiling and looking like you were in control and having fun . you come in here smiling . looks like you 're having a pretty good time .
there seems to be a new maturity about you . it 's taken you a while to sort of find your game .

in the independent on sunday .

you grew up in chicago ?
you have a lot of english supporters here . i wonder if you could explain to me what you found particularly difficult about playing victoria today ?
we are getting used to seeing you in quarterfinals of grand slams now . are you used to this yet ?
same sort of thing at the french . you had a quarterfinal against van uytvanck , who was also lower ranked than here . there are no players in the top 10 left in the bottom half of the draw . looks like an open draw from the outside . how does that feel as a player knowing that at least on paper there is a big opportunity ?
you had a very emotional reaction in the end . do you have the feeling you 're dreaming these last days , weeks , months ?
where did you get that confidence ?
yes .
wimbledon is sort of a special place . one point , working in hotels , fed up with tennis . did this sort of dream of coming back here , was that part of the reason why you came back to tennis ?
at that point when you were working i think in restaurants and cafes , what was the thing that made you most fed up with that to then come back to tennis ?
all the matches with serena have been extremely competitive . the next match that you have with her will be tomorrow . do you think it 's going to help you to win having sascha in your corner or does that have nothing to do with it whatsoever ?
well , you can guess .
when you have challenged serena , and you have had some terrific matches with her , what 's been the key for you ?
when you have challenged serena , and you have had some great matches with her , what has been the key for you ?
it was quite a feisty encounter when you played at roland garros . do you expect a fiery encounter again against serena ? it 's often how it is on court .
so we 're doing our jobs well ?
how well do you think you 're playing over the last , whatever , those nine days ? you had a good win today . bencic is a good player . talk about that .
confidencewise , are you almost there now ? 100 % confidencewise ?
when you 're on the court .
you tell me for you . 100 % ? do you feel like you 're still working ?
i know you hear a lot about serena . you have played serena a ton of times . but 2012 , i think , was the semis here . you were close there , too , no , against serena ?
you were close .
but do you feel like you 're pretty close to her if you do it the right way ?
what sort of satisfaction and developing confidence have you derived from working so hard to get back from the injuries that you had ? because you have had some really debilitating situations and you 've made this this far back . what does that do for you ?
has that helped you psychologically on the court , to have overcome these hurdles , to have gotten as far as you 've gotten ?
what are some of those lessons that you just alluded to ?
seemed like a bit more progress today . another round and improving still .
this is a key stage for you because the next round is the stage you got to several times and not gone further . i 'm surprised that you have that record here because obviously you won the girl 's tournament . are you surprised , too ?
i was reading in the week about the key , which is very pretty , your incentive for running the marathon . clever idea . the shops are open in london tomorrow . would you dare try to give yourself the same incentive for getting through on monday ?
your friend serena is also in a pretty big match coming up on monday . how do you see that ?
tactically do you have any thoughts on it ?
garbine muguruza is next . can you assess her ?
serena came through against heather watson yesterday . did you watch that match ? how impressed were you with heather watson ? there 's talk today of her becoming a top10 player , grand slam winner .
your match begins at 1:00. muguruza begins at 11:30. almost at the same time finish two matches . you think you have a little advantage because of the short time ?
on monday all of the round of 16 matches will take place . it 's a unique scheduling for grand slams . can you talk about that and the excitement of all the men , all the women playing on one day .
yes .
from a fan 's perspective , what would that day of tennis be like watching at home ?
you were speaking before about serena 's match against heather . thinking about what serena and venus both mean to the sport and to the players who have come up since they have , how would you put that in perspective , what these two women have meant to their sport and everybody who 's come since ?
frontrunners .
just talk about you 're playing great again and why ?
i remember talking about it at roland garros when you lost early , you seemed to be upset . but then you left roland garros and you came to england and all of a sudden you changed . what happened there ?
did you tell yourself something different when you got home and you were having problems ? did you say , i need to do something different ?
so do you feel like you 're doing a little bit different ? looks almost the same , but you have always been very smart anyways on the court , whether you 're creative or all of that ?
so is the confidence all there now ?
that was after last week or just this week here ?
you might have to play petra who has been playing well . you know her extremely well . talk about that . maybe on grass , maybe in front .
but you must feel like if you 're playing great , you can beat her , anyways ?
talk us through all that . how do you describe that performance ?
does it seem , looking back on the match , like a blur ? like do you remember like how intense that first set was and how well you played those set points in particular ?
let me make sure about the last point . the line judge called it out and you challenged it ?
you challenged it ?
what kind of thought went through your mind when you see some ball mark got in and you realize you won ?
your next opponent is wozniacki . how do you see that match ?
how do you see her as a player and her tennis style ?
you have played against her sometimes . what do you remember ?
was that the best grass court match you think you 've played ? and then also , how comfortable are you on the surface ?
what 's the most difficult thing for you on grass that you have to adjust to ?
what does wimbledon mean to you ? for a lot of the players , they say this one is one of their favorite tournaments because of tradition and history . what is this tournament about for you ?
you looked in control of that match for a set and a half , then it turned . how do you explain what happened ?
there was a point towards the end of the third set when you were in a winning position in the rally , but you decided to challenge . it was just in . is that the kind of point you 'll think about later ?
how well she started playing in the second half of the match , do you think you were unprepared for that because how easy the first two matches were for you ?
were you surprised by how well she served ?
when you went off court after the second set , what were you telling yourself ? how do you try to motivate yourself to come back out on court in the third set ?
must be tough so soon after losing , but can you tell us a little bit about what it 's meant to have been a wimbledon champion for the last year and how it feels to lose it ?
have you any plan of what you do now ? i presume you expected to be here all next week .
earlier in the week you spoke about when you first won wimbledon , what it was like to come back , all the pressures at that time . what has it been like for you this time as the defending champion and what do you think you 'll take from this particular experience ?
do you expect serena to win this now ?
did you feel unable to play as well as you wanted to in the third set ? were you tired or feeling weak at all ?
a match where you played pretty well . is it tough to get over a match like that , that you played well but ended up losing ?
when you say you were n't feeling 100 % , is it because of lack of preparation you had with the sickness or nothing to do with it ?
you go to the u.s. now , not your favorite part of the year . what are you hoping happens there ?
you said you 'll need some time to get over this and to move on . what exactly do you do to put these sorts of results behind you ?
how did that one feel today ?
how different do you feel now compared to that first match when you were down and things were n't kind of clicking ?
you lead in aces now or you have been . how much do you kind of look at that as a gauge for how well you 're playing , and your power game , is that kind of indicative of how it 's all going ?
how do you sort of define power , your power game ? people talk about how important it is here in particular . petra and serena and maria are kind of at the top with you . how do you kind of define the power game and how important it is ?
is it a blessing and a curse , the power tennis ?
has this always been your style of play even when you were young , 13 , 12 ? was that how you played tennis ?
what have you been proudest of after week 1 ?
with three matches now under your belt and coming in , you know , not really sure what your grass court form would be , do you now go into the second week like more relaxed than otherwise , or obviously now that the stakes are higher , less so ? how do you feel ?
maybe some of us forget after the australian , like this is still a really big thing getting into a second week for you , is n't it ?
is this the first time that you have spent july 4 away from home , like of your pro career ?
do you have barbecue plans ?
back to one more power question . when we talk about that and some of the other players we mentioned , like kvitova and maria and serena , do you watch them specifically maybe because they are the type of player that you are ?
have you found yourself in a latenight lindsay davenport youtube binge at any point ?
how would you assess your mixed doubles performance yesterday ?
you never played mixed doubles before ?
did it feel different ?
nick is a very divisive sort of creature on the court because he brings all this charisma , and that sort of puts people on one side or the other . what do you think about him ?
have you stopped smiling in the last two hours or so ? you seem pretty happy .
tactically , did you make adjustments the middle of the second set to turn things around ? petra was at a bit of a loss to explain what happened out there . gamewise , how did you do it ?
grass is not your favorite surface , it 's hers . you 're down a set and a break . having all these things against you , does it bring something out in you ?
the stats before this match had keys , vandeweghe , all these top servers . you were right next to them .
we remember you from way back .
it was not your best shot , but ...
was there a point where you thought that you wanted it to become a weapon ?
you mentioned getting older , problems with consistency , partly because of injuries this season . you 've been no.1 in the world , made it to a final at a grand slam tournament . was there any point where you wondered whether you could get back to those levels ?
are days like this the reason that you are still playing and are still determined to get back to where you were ?
you have radwanska next .
can you put some words on the match today ?
is it because of she surprised you or something ? how did she play , caroline ?
what positive things did you take from wimbledon now and what negative things ? do you understand ?
the other thing is your dress . your dress , your clothes with the lace was much spoken about . somebody said it was from a wedding dress ?
there 's nothing special ? the lace is not from something ?
in my opinion , it 's the most beautiful tennis dress i have ever seen . it 's so beautiful . this is a new dress for this year for wimbledon ?
you hope to come back again here next year ?
did she raise her play at all from the matches where you succeeded against her ?
so was her game very much the same as when you had beaten her ?
is it possible to take in all of that yet , the drama that unfolded this afternoon ?
even though you lost , was it still the greatest day of your career ?
how would you describe the feeling out there , going toetotoe with a player who may be the greatest of all time ?
what was the difference between you ?
yes . what did she have that you did n't today ?
the game in the third set when you were up 3love , how important was that one game ?
what have you learnt about yourself today and what will you take from this experience moving forward positively ?
you seemed to have quite a slow start , then wild swings in momentum . what do you put those two things down to ?
did the crowd help you to find another level today ?
you spoke a moment ago of what you learned about yourself . what did you learn about serena from going facetoface with her for the first time ?
what does the ball feel like coming from her ?
having played her today and taken what you have , if you played her tomorrow , could you beat her ?
would you beat her next time ?
you feel you could beat her next time now ?
it would be very easy for you to have been daunted , not because you admired serena from afar , but was there any point during the match that you thought , i used to have a poster of her on my bedroom wall when i was a girl ?
sounds like you really have an appetite for these kind of games , taking the best in the world on . going ahead , do you think you 'll build on those goals you just talked about ?
obviously not now , but do you think in a week or two you 'll reflect a bit more positively on the experience ?
you 've established it 's not your greatest day , but would you consider that the best level you played at in terms of the intensity , the ball striking , the pace of the ball ?
you ca n't have played much better than that and lost . you hit a level of excellence in the second and third sets , extraordinary , especially in terms of defense .
is there anything else that you can say to describe serena 's serve and what it 's like to face her , knowing she can pull it out at those key moments ?
what are your plans for now tonight , tomorrow ? how will you go through recovery ?
a lot of times when people lose to someone like serena , it 's like she played great and everything . because of the way it played out , do you feel like that was yours for the taking and that 's why you 're so disappointed ?
you talk about being at the end and how you learned from it . what would you have done , not so much tactically , but what would you have done , looking back , to put yourself in a better position at the end of the match ?
what is it like when you have serena on the other side of the net ? people talk about she 's an intimidating person to see there . you matched her today . why were you able to do that ?
serena said after the match that you should absolutely aim for the top 20. in fact , she said you should aim higher . i wonder just how high are your ambitions . are you aiming higher , maybe top 10 , top 5 ?
do you think serena is actually intimidating to other players or is that just what we see from outside ?
andy murray has tweeted that you made him f'ing proud . are you conscious of having made britain proud today ?
you were pretty annoyed after that loss to maria in paris . are you crankier today ?
you spoke it us earlier this week and explained how you felt more relaxed and things felt a little bit different . was it more like a revisitation of the demons coming back , 2 and love ?
were you nervous ? was it nerves ?
how do you feel now ?
do you feel you threw away your game today ? not that she won but that you ...
was there a point where you realized that the game was gone ? did you feel you could regroup after the first set ?
when your serve started to let you down , you had five double faults . on the fifth one i think you chucked your racquet back to the kit bag . did n't seem like anything was going right ?
there was one particularly vocal fan in the crowd . did you hear her ?
was that helpful or distracting ? she was told to shut up by the umpire .
at this stage , can you forecast who will go all the way to the finals ?
who do you think is playing really well ?
is everything going according to plan ?
does the court you play on matter to you ?
players at this stage talk about taking matches one match at a time . how easy or difficult is that to do in reality ?

did you watch the game ? did you like his performance on centre court ?
since 2003 , has the grass changed dramatically at all ?
does the heat bother you ?
you 've been up in the top 10 now for a decade , you and a few others . younger players come up and fall away quite quickly . is there any reason for that ? why have you managed to stay up there so long ?
in what ways do you think the experience of having won here fuels that desire and passion to do it again ?
over the past 10 years , are you much better than you used to be ?
do you feel much better in the past 10 years than you have ?
when you had the shoulder problems , what kept you going through that ? sometimes players give up .
when you came off court , you said you absolutely believed you could win this championship . is that because you 've done it before or because of the way you 're playing and feeling right now ?
how does the enjoyment compare to the run when you did n't expect it ?
serena and venus could play each other . they started in 1998 , a long time ago . how incredible they 're still there ?
how do your days off the court differ here when you 're staying in a house compared to the usual ?
you said you were playing bocci last night . are you any good at it ?

can you tell us a little bit about the injury and what happened in the first set .
what do you think was the key to turning it around in the first set ?
you probably get asked about martina hingis every single press conference .
but is there something a little extra special with her watching you ?
how difficult a player is matteksands to play against ? she 's quite different .
what do you think you need to do to make the step up and become a grand slam champion ?
bethanie has been very vocal , criticizing the white rule . i wonder what your opinion is ?
yeah . are you in favor of it or ...
the bookies is not tipping you to win this tournament , but what do the bookies know ? what i wonder is whether or not it helps your game not to have any pressure whatsoever ?
the first set was a ride for you . the second set , what happened ? did you get nervous ? she improve a lot ? what do you think about it ?
what sort of momentum or attitude can you take from a win like this where you did have to fight a little bit ?
do you like this kind of surface , which is dry because of this weather ? is it better for you , this kind of grass , comparing to other grass you played before in recent years ? you have to play camila giorgi . you lost to her twice and won once . what do you remember of those matches and what do you expect ?
about the grass , you did n't tell me if this grass for you is better than the grass when is more slippery or wet ? there is one grass you like most or not ?
how do you actually assess your season so far ? do you feel like a contender this year ?
bethanie matteksands said last night it 's hard to express yourself and be creative with what you wear . i wonder if you would welcome back to a time when there was a little more flexibility when you could choose what to wear on court ?
we 've seen in the wta tour events you like to use the oncourt coaching breaks with your dad a lot . at the grand slams you ca n't do that . do you think the grand slams could introduce it and allow it full stop , even shouting from the box ?
do you find it different when you play in the grand slams that you ca n't use them ? maybe in the second set today you would have used the break at some point .
do you think grass is a surface where you have to think less ; that you are more instinctive ?
camila giorgi , a very instinctive player , she is probably stronger or more efficient
you 're going to play her .
i was asking you .
you talk about the grass and being comfortable on it and all . fourth round is the highest result you 've gotten here . how much are you motivated to get at least to there or beyond ?
your necklace has a key on it .
what does it mean ?
do you wear it all matches ?
nice to see you playing well again . looking back now on the early part of the year when you hired martina as a coach , did you go a little bit offcourse ? was it perhaps a bit of a bad decision or strategic error , with all due respect to her , to work with her and the result of that not being very good ?
so you did n't feel there was anything she was doing that threw your game off or made it more difficult or confused you and contributed to your problems rather than ...
when did the match turn for you ? you had a disappointing first set and then you were broken immediately again . was it breaking back ...
you knew it was going to be the turn ?
your record here is quite distinguished . how heavily did you have to draw on that to win that match today ?
you 're popular here , as well , are n't you ? is that a help ?
just one other thing . you 're one of nine german women who are in the top 100. we have one . do you have any reason for explaining that ?
toni nadal has been quoted as describing you as germany 's best player , but he says that he does n't think that you 're fit enough . in the same article there was a suggestion that martina hingis urged you to lose weight , as well . what do you say to those sort of comments ? do they upset you in any way ?
what sort of things are you doing differently now than you were doing before ?
do you think that could make the difference between now and two years ago , when you got to the final , to taking that dream step to winning the championships ?
would you say you 're the fittest you 've ever been now then ?
another quick win today . how long do you think it 's going to take you to get deep into a match this year ? you seem to be very much at ease out there .
what do you have to improve on ?
there 's a lot of pressure that comes with defending a title . you talked about you would be nervous for your firstround match , coming back to play again . on the surface it looks like it could n't have gone better . are you surprised with how your title defense has started ?
how easy is it to take things one match at a time at a tournament that you 've had so much success in ?
have you ever not done that and kind of looked far ahead ?
jelena just finished her match . she 'll be your next opponent . what are your thoughts on her game and the challenge of facing her ?
what are your observations of the way she 's endured throughout her career ? what has she shown you with the way she 's stuck with it and sustained such a level of excellence ?
when you win so quickly each time , what do you do with the extra spare time ?
what are you reading ?
last year here you had to play lucie and barbora and another czech player . how hard is it to play someone you 're so close with and have so much at stake when the person across the net from you is someone you care about ?
there 's been a lot of talk about how much pressure there is on serena coming here . do you think that takes pressure off some of the other top women or is the pressure on them to actually stop serena winning ?
would you prefer to avoid serena or play serena here if you were to win ? would it make it more special if you got to face her and beat her as one of your scalps for the title or is she better to avoid ?
is it fair to take whatever struggles you have been having lately and still winning is a really good sign and a good step that if you can struggle and still pull it out , that 's the whole idea ? bottom line , that 's an important stage in being a great player ?
was today a little bit of a struggle or not as much as the other match ?
what impressed you about her game ?
are you working with scott ?
when did that start ?
how has it been going so far ?
not injured ?
is it something you 've got to work on , winning on days when you 're not at your best , or have you always been pretty good at that ?
is that the trick , if there is one , to it ? you see serena doing it all the time . i mean , what is sort of the magic to that ?
do you feel out there these days after australia that people look at you a little different , play you a little different , maybe playing with less pressure against you now that you 've had some moments where you have done really well ? does that loosen up opponents when they come out to play you , you think ?
i imagine lindsay can help you with that a little bit . is that stuff you have talked about or it 's a weird change ?
what does she kind of tell you specifically about managing expectations ?
you 're doing well , sloane is coming back , and as we talked about , there 's a nice group of american women . as you guys progress or are doing better , is it going to be harder to keep that friendship ? because competition and friendship are a little ...
i think you 're staying in the apartment where lindsay used to stay here . so how is it ? how is her taste ? is it good ? are you happy with it ?
it 's a tall building ? a big building ?
lindsay seems to be staying in a place with a pool , if the picture is right .
have you been over there for a little swim ?
she 's upgraded to better digs ?
have you been having as much fun as you ever have had when there was n't as much pressure or expectation ? is it still fun for you ?
the cameras seemed to catch you grooving to something when you walked out on court . so what was the song that you were listening to ?
you 're playing mixed with nick . how did that come along ? are you concerned that he 's going to say some words that you have never heard before ?
how does that work ? is that an exchange of text messages ? was it down near the signing desk ? how exactly did it work ? your agents back here sniggering in the back ? who put it together ?
i have heard you say in the past you were kind of cool living away from the sisters who were taking some of your stuff . how does it work in the apartment with mom and the sisters ?
do you look at the draw at all ? analysts , as they will do , were saying with seeds falling your draw looks pretty good , your quarter of the draw . do you do that , pay attention ?
do you know anything about your next opponent , a german player ?
you must be overwhelmed , serena next ?
possibly .
back to the serve problem . you had major problems midway through the first set , then you seemed to sort them out . what happened ?
it was very warm in the stands . i 'm guessing in that sunken level court it was even hotter . you trained a lot and lived in florida . does that come into its own ?
it sort of feels like you 've been searching for the real heather , if you like , on the court for a while . you kind of found her today . did it feel like that for you ?
you seemed very efficient today and got the job done . when you went into the match did you think that you must not start slowly ?
how would you describe serena williams , your likely opponent for the next round , but just your observations of her game at this stage of her career , the fact that she has a chance to win a grand slam in a calendar year ?
what specifically about her game do you find most challenging ?
how is it playing three days in a row ? is that giving you momentum ?
a fantastic photo of you just after match point . you could see your emotions . can you describe them for us in that moment .
i take your point about it being presumptuous playing serena in the next round . in eastbourne , we asked you what you would be thinking when the draw came out , would it be the top seed or the qualifier . you got revved up about possibly playing serena .
do you watch her and try to learn from her ?
serena has so many things in her life outside tennis that she manages to fit in . in a way , does it make it better , her achievements ?
how does it seem from the outside looking in ? she has celebrity friends , all these things in her life off the court , but she keeps showing up .
i know you play for the wins , not the money . obviously it 's a considerable sum you 've won now . have you actually got a place of your own yet ?
or are you working towards that ?
is that around here somewhere ?
particularly if you play serena , i wonder how much you might draw on things three years ago when you got to the third round , played radwanska on centre court , if that experience will be useful for you ?
you seemed to have a large row of family there , is that right ? who were they ? how often do they get to watch you ? are they always at wimbledon ?
did it make a difference having them there ?
i saw an article recently where you were quoted as saying you had a few death threats . is this online ? how much does it bother you ? are you worried if you get further in the competition you could get more ?
it was on twitter you were getting some nasty messages .
have you stopped using twitter as a result ?
those nasty ones , were they recently ?
to what extent do you think online abuse is a particularly a problem for female players ?
a number of those posting messages were gamblers complaining you lost .
how will you chill out before the next game ?
how was it out there today ?
are you feeling comfortable on the grass ?
how much more comfortable do you feel like on this surface versus like the clay ?
how are you feeling ? everything seem to be going this way this year ( pointing upward ) ?
talk about that a bit . it 's like going home almost ?
how has it changed ? you 're not a child anymore , so ...
bethanie and coco had big upsets today . i do n't know if you 're following at all .
i suppose your dutch coach , sven , could tell you something about your dutch opponent ?
what is your assessment two matches into your grass season ?
how did you find it out there compared to other arenas where it 's properly warm ?
you struggled a bit with your serve today . can you remember serving three doublefaults in a row ?
have you done that before , three doublefaults in a row ?
every year the same discussion about prize money , women playing bestoffive . do you think it would be a good idea to play bestoffive or not at grand slams ?
kvitova played 35 minutes , men play four hours . is it fair to compare or not ?
a topic that 's come up a few times before with you , with grigor , playing at the same tournament together . how do you manage that side of it ? he told us earlier that you and him analyze each other 's matches . does that ever extend to giving advice and tips ?
did you get the chance to watch any of his match today ?
this does n't have anything to do with the match . it 's a very serious question . probably more than anyone in sport , you have tremendous interest outside the game . you also have a great connection with south carolina in my country , charleston , the great win there , your father going to clemson . could you take a moment and just reflect on what your thoughts were when you heard the news of what occurred there and with the flag .
you must have had a lot of connections with many wonderful people in charleston , and yet such a terrible thing has occurred . juxtaposition and ...
you mentioned shelby . back to that match for a second . i mean , there were circumstances with her and injury and stuff . but when it 's a love and love outcome , obviously it 's unusual . have you had many of those ? is it sort of a weird feeling even as a competitor to be involved in that ?
today was the hottest day on wimbledon on record . we brits like to talk about that . we struggle . for a tennis player , i guess you 're fairly used to it , maybe australia and training in hot conditions , anyway . what was it like out there playing in that ?
were you getting flashbacks yesterday at all about having to chase light here again at wimbledon ?
what was that conversation like between last night and today and sort of preparing yourself to walk out and have 22 in the third set ? it 's tough to start , i think , at that spot .
do you think they ought to have lights at places like here and roland garros ?
talk a little bit about the lindsay/jon/lisa dynamic . you have three great people there but not everybody has that .
how is their approach different ? what makes lisa different than lindsay or whatever ?
you hit 21 aces today . how relieving is it when you can just smash down one of those and walk to the next point ?
as an upandcoming player , what is your appreciation for what serena is doing late in her career and yet still she has the possibility of achieving a calendaryear grand slam ?
what do you admire most when you watch her play ?
what do you admire least when you 're playing against her ?
a lot has been made about the heat today , and i just want to get your opinion on it . some people say it 's a heck of a lot worse in florida . some people are saying , oh , i 'm feeling dizzy out there and it 's oppressive . what was your take on it ?
do you set a different standard for yourself now since australia ? if not , why not ? if you do , why ?
he was around before your time , but what does arthur ashe 's life and legacy mean to you ?
there were three double bagels the other day . what are your memories or experiences being on either end of a double bagel ?
as a pro , have you been on both or no ?
when you 're on the winning end , is it at all awkward or does n't matter at all to you ? when you shake at the net , do you feel inclined to say something ?
i know it 's hard to talk about other players , but how surprised have you been observing what 's happened to bouchard this year ?
is that something all players are kind of wary of , that it could happen to you and that 's one of the things that are in the back of your mind ?
i mean first round and then another first round , kind of get into that rut ?
how nervous were you going into wimbledon this year ? like before this match , given everything , the illness and your leadup and stuff .
how do you tell ?
speaking of bouchard , as a young woman yourself , how have you managed to keep both the pressure at bay and all the stuff , nonsense that goes on around you on the circuit ?
you mentioned earlier that you consider serena one of the greatest tennis players of all time . when you look around at all the sports now , where do you consider her among all athletes at the moment ?
how do you think laura robson is and especially given her injury and recovering from that ?
was it a match that you expected to win ?
you mentioned before the tournament that grass is one of those surfaces where everything happens so fast , things get out of hand . in this match , how would you describe how it went for you ?
you started the season with a few injuries and have been battling . where are you fitnesswise ? are you back to 100 % ? still dealing with things ?
can you talk a little bit about that , how difficult it is as a tennis player to rebuild a fitness base throughout the season when you 're constantly on the road playing tennis .
it was very striking how good she was around the net . that must have something to do with the fact she plays doubles regularly . do you think that would improve your game ?
you just finished the match , do you have any idea how much time off you 're going to take , what you 're going to do to start preparing ?
when someone is hitting a lot of winners like she was , is there part of you hoping she 'll run out of steam eventually ; if you hang in there long enough you 'll be able to come back into the game ?
talking about three double bagels in the first round , the psychology of it , being on either side of it , is it really kind of weird to either win or lose ? i do n't know if you 've ever lost one , but ...
harsh ?
as a junior , have you ever lost one like that ?
hard to come back from it , or you just have to put it out of your mind ?
how difficult was it to start again this morning and get going again after the break ?
were you tempted at all to continue last night , given that you had won that set , had momentum on your side ?
now you 've won , you ca n't be accused of any sour grapes , were you particularly happy about playing court no.12 , fourth match on ? is that a great way to treat the british no.1 ?
the turning point in the game last night seemed to be when you got a couple of calls that got overturned by hawkeye . did you feel you needed that last night to get juices running , because you started playing very well after that ?
how important is it to have a british woman in the second round , just for the momentum of the sport in this country ?
at 54 , you saved three match points . looking pretty hairy at that point .
you had a code violation at a difficult point in the match . how hard was that to deal with ?
what did you do ? it was n't clear . last night you got one for racquet abuse .
have you got your mom and dad this week and how important is it this time around ?
can you tell us a little bit about your gram ?
how nervous were you closing out the match ?
next round , do you see it as an incentive if you win there you might end up facing serena ?
you walked in with the stat sheets . do you use those a lot after matches ? how deeply do you get into analyzing matches afterwards ? do you use those ?
how far do you think you are away from becoming a seed yourself now at grand slams ?
when you came on court today , throughout today 's play , you seemed more pumped up than when you started yesterday . do you need to be sort of pumped up to play your game ?
did you do anything to pump yourself up ? listen to music ?
after code violations , you slapped yourself on the thigh . can we expect to see more overt aggression from you in the future ? it 's good to watch .
how is the thigh , by the way ?
you said you have n't had a match stopped by bad light before . how did you deal with it going home last night , knowing you had to come back today ? did it affect your sleep or anything like that ?
you 're taking on an australian , tomljanovic , in the next round . you took her on in the french open a couple of years ago and she surprised you with an upset . what can you remember from that match ?
obviously that was on clay . here is grass . do you feel the difference on surface tilts the advantage in your favor ?
no doubt there will be no complacency this time around . you wo n't be taking her lightly ?
you wo n't be , i guess , underestimating her abilities ?
that was you playing with nerves , yeah ?
i think it was 35 minutes today . is that the fastest match you can remember playing ? i think it 's the fastest on tour for five years .
when you finish a match so quickly like that , would you go and hit somewhere on the court today or not ?
is it almost embarrassing to win that quickly a match ?
what is it that you like when you 're staying at a home here ? what is it about staying at a home that you enjoy so much ?
what are your views on the fact there 's a heat rule between the second and third sets for women and not for men , who obviously can play five sets ?
it does seem odd , does n't it ?
equal prize money .
yeah .
you 're not the only top player speaking about the first round as something you just want to survive . you 're defending champion . you know you can play . why is it that the first round is such a nervous , tricky thing ?
kiki can be a very dangerous opponent on occasion .
you told us last year that the gardeners in the house you were staying wrote something to encourage you . did you get any messages this year ?
do you know anything about your next opponent ? you have n't played her before .
no .
how long will your parents stay ? is your mom or dad doing some cooking while you 're at home ?
there was a stunning photograph of you in an english sunday paper at the weekend . you were recreating the famous pose of christine keeler , which basically means you did n't have many clothes on . whose idea was that for that image ? i would n't necessarily have put petra kvitova together with that image . how comfortable did you feel posing for it ?
that must have been unexpected to win by that scoreline today for you .
obviously you were just focusing on winning the match and getting into the second round , but at which stage , how long after the match do you have any sympathy for your opponent when you beat somebody 6love , 6love ?
can you remember losing a match love and love yourself ?
is this the first double bagel you ever had , was it , love and love ? first time ever you won ?
2007
you are compatriots but are you good friends ?
your confidence must be very high , because you have done very well here in the past . you have just won birmingham . how do you feel about going forward in this tournament this year ?
would you say you 're in your best form ever ? because you have won three titles this year , which is as many as you 've ever won together .
a tough loss , but what 's your reaction after that match ?
you said you knew it was going to be a difficult tournament for you . why did you think that ?
what was your biggest struggle today in the game ?
you called the trainer to take a look at your left foot . is that an injury you had before ?
it 's okay now ?
you had a great start to the year . you won a couple titles . once you got to europe things changed for you resultswise . what do you think started this ?
is your coaching situation also part of the stress you feel , the fact that you ended your collaboration with your previous coach before wimbledon ?
you had the incident in stuttgart where the man was making threats against you and there was more security . do you think that might have affected your focus there and the next few weeks ?
genie beat you last year in the semifinals . bouchard lost today . how hard has it been for you to follow up your success that you had last year ? obviously you 've had good results earlier this year . does it feel like an up and down that you want to find a level field for yourself ?
after the french you said that you thought you were playing the wrong way with your game . it sounds like you 're happier with the way you 're playing .
you normally go back to romania to relax , right ?
normally you seem to go back to romania and spend time with family and friends . have you ever thought about not doing that ?
is the pressure in romania tougher for you ?
you say you want to work on the mental side of your game . how do you do that ? do you take some time off ? do you watch videos of past performances ?
you said you 're happy with your game .
the mental side of things is what you want to work on .
i was wondering how you do that .
with all of your success that you 've had for yourself , also for the country , are you ever surprised at the reaction back home when you do n't win a title ?
obviously tough coming back here with all the pressure . did it feel like a lot of weight on you , knowing you had points to defend from last year ? did that add to the occasion of today ?
you mentioned that you were unprepared . what has been your physical condition leading up to today , and how did you feel out there today ?
out there how did it feel ?
did you know much about her before going into the match ?
were you aware that your bra strap caused concern for the umpire whether it was a violation of the dress code ?
the loss today , because of the problems , the health problems , fitness problems , does it separate from some of the other losses you 've had along the way ?
what 's the next step for you now ?
you mentioned earlier , under normal conditions , if this were n't the tournament that wimbledon is , you would n't have been out there . what did you show yourself by battling through just to complete this match , given your physical condition ?
how do you feel about making it through , completing the match , given that advice not to compete ?
is there any part of you that is somewhat relieved now that this kind of stretch through wimbledon , all the conversation is that you have to defend all the points , that this segment of the season is over , there may be a less pressure going forward for the rest of the season ?
what is the timeframe for getting this right and also possibly at the same time preventing it from reoccurring ever , if you can ?
was the tear in indian wells a grade 2 ?
are you serious ?
did it affect you most today on the serve ?
you talk about the difficulty of the last couple months , being asked the same questions over and over . how have you coped with that ? how have you dealt with it psychologically ?
it 's been a rough stretch of results since you started working with sam . have you thought about making any changes to your team or say , this might not be working ?
with all the injuries and niggles you 've had throughout this season , do you chalk that up to bad luck here or there , or do you think there was maybe like a core issue in terms of the fitness during the offseason ? what do you chalk it up to ?
you 're very wellspoken and direct with us . do you allow yourself to really let out some emotion , a good cry , throw something or break something , when you get into a private space ?
the last 12 months have been such a rollercoaster . have you been able to put it in any context or is that still too soon for you ?
is today at all a learning experience where you feel like no matter how disappointing it might be , sometimes you 're better off following the doctor 's advice than going out there when you ca n't deliver what you 're best at ?
you became an international athlete in the spotlight so quickly . it 's a tough go . talk about the learning experience . what have you learned during this period ?
in what ways do you think you 've grown during this period as a person ?
so what does that mean to you ? good player ? good win for you ?
what are your thoughts for you for the challenge for serena who is going for this unbelievable calendar grand slam and the way you 've seen her play during this recent run ?
what does it mean to you to be able to watch her at this age the way she 's playing now ?
i did n't realize it was your first time out there . talk about what that means to a tennis player , your feeling , what you noticed .
lleyton said , 20 years , looked around , a day where he went out by himself with headphones on and sat in there for a while yesterday . had you not been out there just to look , hang out ?
why have you never taken the chance to go in there ?
did any images of matches you have seen on centre court float through your mind as you 're out there yourself ?
how would you describe the state of your game right now ?
what would you say you 've learned that 's most important to your game right now from your earlier experiences ?
is that something that was difficult for you at earlier times that you 've made an adjustment , or is that something that 's always been a strength for you ?
how different is it playing on centre court to one of the lower courts ?
once the match starts , do you forget about the crowd and all these people ?
july 5th is the 40th anniversary of arthur ashe winning here , beating jimmy connors in the men 's final . you being as young as you are , what do you know of arthur ashe 's legacy and what does it mean to you ?
what sense do you have of sacrifices he made and stances that he took , if any , during his tennis career that went beyond just him playing tennis ?
do you watch any documentaries or go back and look at old clips of evert and navratilova , the old players ?
the history of the game , do you ever go back and read about it or look at it much ?
do you watch tennis in general away from the courts and the tournaments ?
billie jean king once said that in her achievements she was thinking about her soul , and her personality was a great match with the time when she was playing tennis . do you think that your personality and your soul is a great match with the time that you play tennis ?
thinking of your personality and the way that tennis has changed throughout the time , you think that the way you play tennis now , today , fits with what tennis is played like today ?
the way you are as a player ?
speaking earlier about serena and the grand slam , i was just wondering , when you see serena 's game and the way she plays , what to you is the greatest strength that she brings onto the court that makes her the dominant player that she is ?
how do you assess your first game back at wimbledon ?
is there a special mindset when you start a tournament like this without playing before ? something you say before the match to avoid feeling nervous ?
were you concerned playing a british player the crowd might be against you ?
what did you make of jo as an opponent ?
had you seen her play at all before today ?
on the tele ?
physically did you feel your energy was back at the usual level ?
when you were in the press conference here the other day , you acknowledged that serena is , in your perception , the player to beat . how would you describe the depth of the field right now , the strength of the women 's tour in general , and how many players do you think do have a legitimate shot to contend for a major title ?
do you still get the same kind of buzz ?
you still get it after all these years ?
as you know , the temperatures this week are expected to be quite high , 35 , 36 on wednesday and thursday . the heat rule , only the female players can call upon that . do you think that 's a bit unfair on the male players ?
the female players can call and stop for a 10minute break between the second and third sets . that 's not available for the male players . do you think that 's a bit unfair , sexist at all ?
do you think it 's sexist ?
on the men 's side , lleyton hewitt just was defeated . supposedly his last match here . he had grit , was a fighter . did you have any thoughts about lleyton over the years and that fighting spirit , did that resonate ?
is one of those qualities an inner quality to battle and fight ?

do you still reflect on the moment when you won here as a teen ?
do you really like that thing about not being introduced when you walk on ?
is there anything you particularly enjoy about staying in wimbledon village during the tournament ?
you must be pleased with that . first match is not always easy . how do you feel about that ?
is it tricky playing someone you do n't know much about ?
in that second set when you had to get the umpire , we could n't hear all of what you said , but can you talk us through what you said to the umpire ?
you were really talking at her for quite a long time .
this is the second incident today regarding this kind of thing . we talked about it at the french open , as well , because vika and serena had a similar thing . so do you think it 's a good idea to get a replay in these specific cases to do a replay so someone could weigh in ?
you have bethanie next . can you just talk about that matchup .
there was a lot of good communication between you and your box . looked like you were really enjoying it . how good is it to have bastian there and supporting you ?
how do you feel physically ? we saw you a bit crying during the last set .
what was your feelings during the match today ?
of all your eight grand slam victories --
-- how does this one rate ?
you appeared to be very driven right from the word `` go . ''
was the plan more about getting you up or upsetting maria by being so aggressive so early ?
we have . she 's fine .
after you won , you spoke to the camera and said , thanks for the advice . what was the advice ?
were you surprised that maria did n't find answers for your impressive game ?
one thing is to beat you ; another thing is to be overwhelmed . she was destroyed . is that surprising you a bit or not ?
you missed so much tennis over the last year . was there any point when you were at home you felt there was n't going to be an opportunity to get back into the winner 's circle ? did you ever feel it had gone ?
how does this impact your motivation , looking ahead , going forward from here ?
people have always wondered about the small number of tournaments that you play . when do you next intend playing ? are you going to play any more this year than you have in previous years ?
what will you do to celebrate your win ?
you talked about your focus . how much of that focus came from the memory of your sister ?
how long can you carry that through your career ?
you mentioned before you used to speak after matches . there was a nice line about when you spoke to her after the french open , when you had beaten somebody .
do you remember who you beat so heavily that time ?
the time between now and the finish of your match , can you tell us about what you did ? did you let yourself enjoy the moment in some way ?
so , no , you did n't allow yourself to celebrate ?
are you going to call sybille bammer and tell her , see what i 'm capable of ?
watching federer and gonzlez play in their semifinals , have comprehensive wins , is that a good reminder --
we did n't see two great men 's semifinals here . the women 's final was a little bit one-sided . what do you expect for the men 's final ? will it be different or not ?
of the seven matches you played , when were you in the most trouble ?
do you think the means of today 's win will make it hard for sharapova to beat you down the track in a big match ?
you said , 'physically , contrary to the public opinion . '
you say also you do n't read the papers . where does this public opinion come from ?
when roger came in here the other night , even after that match , even after beating the ' h-e double hockey sticks ' out of andy , he talked about fear and doubt before the match . do fear and doubt play any role in your thinking before a match ?
will you read the newspapers tomorrow ? are you afraid to have a big head ?
is it possible for you to explain what went wrong for you today ?
you seemed to have trouble with your ball toss a few times .
did you anticipate , even though you did n't serve well , that she would return that strongly ?
was there any point in the match where you thought she was going to go off the boil , the momentum has to stop ?
would you prefer today to play with an open roof ?
seems that you did n't serve very well during the tournament , for the whole tournament . is it a technical problem ? is it confidence ? is it physical ?
you said you can never underestimate her . but did you expect her to play so well today ?
do n't you think this tournament was rather strange ? you were two points from defeat . serena was also twice . the level was probably a little bit inconsistent because it 's the first important tournament of the year , in your opinion , or are there other reasons maybe ?
4-1 in the second , you looked like you pulled something out of your bag . was that a piece of paper ?
can i ask what it said ?
of ?
you beat her easily in wimbledon when she was a favorite . now she beat you in the final here very easy . how would you explain that ?
is there any feeling of shock and awe when you 're on the court ?
it 's been a while since you have n't been able to dig into the match at a certain point .
appreciated very much how graceful you were in the speech on court .
i want to know if you think this is a matter of experience , since you 're getting used to talking on the microphone , or also because you felt you had to give something more to the crowd since the match was so-so ?
does she still have the best first serve in women 's tennis ?
andy roddick lost completely against federer . he was handling the loss very nice . he said , just go back to work , work hard . what kind of a lesson is that for you today ?
it 's been a long time since we 've seen you so excited after a match . how much did that mean to you ?
how did you win it ? where were you better than nicole ?
how much difference does experience make in a match like this ? does experience stay with you if you go through a tough patch or do you have to relearn it ?
do you regard it as an astonishing achievement to be in a grand slam final ?
i did n't see hobart , but your level first match in hobart to now , how much higher is it ?
seemed that you got nicole stretched out to be in command of the points .
when the third match point went by , did you start saying , how long is this going on ? did you think about the gagarooney , as you put it ?
you 've been to many grand slam finals . where does this one rate in the actual achievement of getting to a final , having played so little last year and all you had to go through at the end of last year ? where does it rate in your list of achievements ?
the second time you stop and when you come back for injury problems , you come back and you go to final to finals again . you are still at the level of the first players in the world . what it means that you are so stronger to the other players ? you are a champion that 's able in every case to come back and play at this level ?
in a match like this , how much time do you spend before the match going over kind of a mental checklist of what she does well , what you 're going to need to do to beat her ?
explain that more .
so are you saying you 're a little more reactive to the situation ?
do you think you intimidate other women out there because of what you have achieved ? where they take up , at that point you seem to let rip ?
you 've had tight matches all the way through here . match points against you . but at that point , you seem to just shake off a change and away you go .
could you have done this at the us open if things had broken differently or are you better now than you were last fall ?
do you think that actually the ability to play your way into form is a skill that you 've acquired in the last couple years ?
you 've beaten more inexperienced seeded players on the way to where you are now . kim or maria next . how much more difficult will that be ?
no . i am just saying they are more experienced than what you have come up against .
but in terms of finals experience .
has being out of the game increased your enthusiasm for the game ?
if being out with injury recently , has that renewed your enthusiasm for the game ? if so , if you stay healthy , will we see serena full time on the tour this year ?
there is an awful lot of drama around you these days . do you thrive on that ?
do you enjoy having all the drama and people that are second-guessing you or confronting you with what issues people are talking about ?
your father did say at the outset look at the younger sister .
he did say that though .
what does it prove that you can get through to a grand slam final when by your own admission you do n't feel like you 're playing your best just right now ?
i think vaidisova was serving 5-6 to stay in the tiebreak , set point . on your return , you let out this amazing blood-curdling yell . how much of that is involuntary or how much is that sending a statement to vaidisova on the other side of the net ?
what 's the prevailing emotion ? it is rage or something else ?
looking at the results of last year , which one in your opinion was the really no.1 ? because you know mauresmo won two grand slam finals , and henin was playing , and then maria . which one in your opinion was the real no.1 ?
can you just break down kim and maria individually and what kind of challenges they will present to you ?
do you think maria is a better player this year ?
getting better and better as she goes along ?
will you be watching tonight ?
do you think andy has got a better crack this year ?
commentary on channel 7 , an allegation that someone in your box using the reflection from their watch in the sunlight to try and distract your opponent . it was something that nicole has denied . what was your response to it ?
so creative commentary , do you think ?
in a tight match like that , what was the difference between you and serena ?
quite a number of unforced errors on your side , but also a lot of winners . what was your pregame plan ?
how does this semifinal compare with the one at roland garros last year ? do you feel you 're a more mature player ?
were you affected by the sun glare at any stage during the match ?
you did n't notice any glare coming towards your eyes during the match ?
there was a suggestion on the channel 7 commentary that a member of the williams box was shining his watch into your eyes .
did your nervous system go on and off , back and forth ?
there was a point in the tiebreak where serena 's first shot , she screamed incredibly loud . you lost the follow-up one . did you find that off-putting ?
there was nothing about it that struck you as a bit odd , out of place ?
your thoughts on the match ?
were you surprised you won in straight sets ?
was this the best you played this tournament , would you say ?
you 'll have favoritism going into the final . what are your thoughts ?
there 's been a bit of time since you played her last . how hard is that ?
i assume you knew the outcome of the first match before you went out there .
how does that affect your mindset knowing who you would play if you were to win the match ?
you prefer to go on first or does n't matter ?
first time through to the final here . what do you think you 've done differently to other years ?
how are you feeling going into saturday 's game ?
what is your preparation between now and saturday ?
how much of a surprise is it for you to play against serena ? before the start of the tournament , did it cross your mind that possibly you can play serena in the final in the australian open ?
when you look back sort of in retrospect , sort of look at your career , how much does that match two years ago figure into things , either as motivation or one of those matches where you kick yourself ? how big does that loom in your mind ?
could you hear the techno music ? could you hear that on the court ?
talk about the difference in the final with serena in wimbledon and this one .
and you are the no.1 ?
she 's no.81 .
are you in kind of a way surprised she got that far ?
have you seen any of her matches ?
is it at all kind of encouraging or inspiring to know that you can have your injuries , some issues , if you have the game and the ability to play well on the big points , you can dip down in triple digits and still come back ?
you can really go off the map and still pretty quickly get back on top .
is it encouraging to you as a top player to know you can sort of go off the radar for a while and still ...
do you feel like the crowd will be on your side in the final ?
thoughts on that match ?
were you happy with your game , or would you say it dropped off in the quarterfinal and semifinal ?
what sort of sadness is there saying good-bye to the australian open ?
you will come back tomorrow and catch up with people ?
do you think she can win the final ?
if you were playing either one in the final , would you change anything you did ?
afternoon .
do you have any idea why your level of play dropped in those two important matches ?
do you think you could plan a holiday next january and come back to australia ?
in terms of tennis matches , what have been your good memories from your australian opens and what have been the disappointing memories ?
does the media , tv , have any attraction to you at any stage in the future ?
another match over two hours .
how did you win this one ?
you played the big points better than her .
you took a timeout for a foot injury . what was the injury ?
you 've coped okay with consecutive two-hour matches ?
what was happening with your serve today ? was it conditions ?
did you find at the end you finally had her figured out ?
you feel like going against either kim or martina that you 're going to have to show a better level ?
the serve was not working for you . were there other reasons for you feeling a bit scratchy ?
have you been watching martina and kim throughout the tournament ?
do you feel like you 're playing well enough to win the tournament ?
you finally beat kim on a hard court last summer . she got you in the xo . is she still the biggest challenge to you physically on hard courts ?
that 's because you 're playing better defense ; do n't always have to play the offense against her ?
both dads were animated today . was it unfair that your father was singled out for coaching ?
you were given a violation .
what did the umpire say ?
can you switch over to martina . kim is the favorite in that match . if she wins , is that match more on your racquet ?
against martina , if you play to your level you should win .
your thoughts on an unpredictable match ?
it had ebbs and flows . could n't predict what was going to happen .
how much did confidence have to do with what happened at the end of the match ?
with all that said , that 's a match maybe , in your dominant form , that you win . strategy was right . you were executing right . she was having a lot of unforced errors . slipped away , and you let her back in .
do you get any satisfaction out of the pleasure that you give people who watch you ? you give us more tennis . they used to think a dropshot was against the law till you showed up here last year .
do you feel you 're still on your comeback , or do you feel the comeback was last year and this year it 's about winning these tournaments ?
based on her game , are you surprised she has n't won more slams ?
does it give you confidence coming out of here that maybe you will be able to beat the top four soon or are you saying to yourself , maybe my best is n't quite good enough to beat kim or justine or amlie or maria ?
so physical in a fitness sense , or just physical that they 're hitting through you ?
10 years ago you walked away from here with your first grand slam title . how would the martina hingis of '97 fare this year ?
are you able to quantify how much better or more complete a player you are now compared to 10 years ago ?
the tour now generally is tougher , deeper , the competition ?
if she comes back , fine , but if she does n't win majors , she 's not going to like this life any more . what is it like now for you ?
at least a couple times in the match you stopped play in the middle of a point to question a call . does that reflect a growing comfort with the electronic line calling system ?
would you have been hesitant in the beginning to stop in the middle of a point and challenge a call as opposed to playing it out , or do you feel you 're reflexively doing it in matches now ?
two-hour match , fluctuating fortunes . how did you eventually win it ?
can you explain 62 unforced errors ?
how tough is she to play against ?
is it fair to say the errors in the match might have been as much a result of aggressive risk-taking ?
do you consider a semifinal a satisfactory outcome so far ?
could that exhibition you played against maria help ? played against her once ; you have a feel .
is there any real concern about the struggle today , or is it put it behind you and tomorrow is another day ?
against maria , just with the shrieking , the grunting , do you find it hard to hear the ball coming off the racquet ?
no distraction to you ?
speaking of shrieking and grunting , you had the four big fans in the support . does the crowd support help you here ?
you must know them .
greater sense of comfort in yourself and other players stopping points in the middle to challenge a call as opposed to waiting till a point ends on a call ?
i just mean in general .
does that reflect a comfort with the electronic line calling that you 're willing to stop a point in the middle ?
if it 's in the middle of a point and you stop because you think it 's out , you 're going to lose the point if you 're wrong , as opposed to playing the point and winning it .
the winner of your semifinal tomorrow is likely to be the favorite in the final . does that follow ? do you buy that ?
where do you think the line is regarding coaching from the sidelines ? should a player be able to look to their coach to see whether they should challenge or be able to communicate during a match ? what do you think ?
justine announced she 's going to come back to play in paris . is that something you and the other players will be pleased to see her ?
given the fact that you always prefer to win than to lose , once you retire , do you think it will be more difficult for you to think of your past as a tennis player as a winner or a loser ? if you come out as a winner of the last year or as a loser ?
not enough ?
what was your reaction at the end ? i 'm so glad i won this match , not wanting to lose this match not having played very well in your own mind ? you did n't want to go out of this tournament having played a bad match and lost .
was it a matter of survival of the fittest at the end , who was the stronger at the end ?
was she a little more aggressive than you ?
you seemed quite nervous at the start . did it take you a while to settle down ?
what do you do about that ? will that be something you 'll pick up on the next tournament , being more aggressive ?
on speed and placement , you were staying with her .
your shoulder , what happened ?
what is the problem ?
you hurt it before the match ?
was it bothering you in previous matches or only this one ?
you seemed to be having her running more than you were running a lot of that match . you had her moving a lot . is that a good sign for your future ?
you 're the same age as maria . when did you first know her or meet her ?
why is that ?
do you remember what year that was ?
2002 ?
who writes your scripts ?
two points from defeat .
where would you put that up there with some of your three-set wins ?
how do you feel about your level of play today compared to jankovic ?
why do you think you had a flatter game today ?
when was the last time you played a semifinal at a slam but had n't played your opponent ?
is it an odd feeling to have at this stage of the tournament ?
did the sickness affect you at all today ?
what have you been doing to try to get over it ?
talk about your serving in the third set , the latter part . you hit a lot of clutch serves . looked like you were tiring at that point in the match .
one stroke you 've always felt never departed you in the ups and downs in the last few years ?
you said on the court that you 're the ultimate competitor . when you got to that space where you 're two points from being defeated , do you like that situation ? do you live for a situation like that ?
is that calm conditions what happened you today ? your opponent had a lot more breakpoint opportunities , but you converted nearly every one you had .
are you ready to create some more carnage in the last two rounds ?
do you feel pressure from being one of the few americans that are being successful lately in the women 's division ? not one woman was seeded in the top 16 here from the united states .
no .
have you heard from anybody at home that you have n't heard from for a while , all of a sudden the messages of good wishes ?
were you puzzled at first by your forehand ? could n't seem to hit anything in .
when you 're that out of rhythm , are you telling yourself to play steady or something else ?
you were three points from . you hit that beautiful backhand cross-court return when she was serving for the match . did you think of that ahead of time ? where did it come from ?
does it feel like a magic carpet ride ? a lot of people did n't think you would get this far .
is n't that a pat-on-the-back time ?
why does that negativity exist , in your opinion ?
do you ever read the positive things that are written about you ?
you were saying you 're always staying positive on court . when you make unforced errors , occasionally it 's pretty obvious you 're yelling at yourself .
what did you make of her performance ? first israeli player to make the quarterfinal . the entire country was watching at 4 in the morning .
your mother is your coach . you 've had a good week . what can you say about her contribution to how you 're doing at this tournament ?
what do you read at the changeovers ?
do you write something by yourself ?
negative or not , can you understand how the fans or press have doubts about you coming in here , seeing how you have n't played and have n't had great results in two years ?
we 're all here . tell us .
when is the last time you had to dig so deep to win a match ? how much more do you think you have in your tank ?
did you enjoy the battle between the spectators , the israelis , the americans ?
if you were to finish this script today on how this australian open would go , how would it end ?
which number do you think you deserve as you are playing now ?
do your earrings ever get in the way with your swings or anything ?
the wins sweeter now that the expectations are n't there ?
was your serve and return the key to your win today ?
going into a semifinal now , are you happy with your game overall ?
does it feel different or better than your last semifinal ?
do you think you can draw from that experience ?
how do you assess lucie 's performance ?
how close are you to safarova ? are you friends ?
can you tell us about each of the two opponents you might play ?
must feel strange never having played serena .
what was the first time you saw serena ?
was she especially intense in practice ?
was it one of those , wow , i hope to hit the ball like her someday ?
how much mental work did you do in the off-season as opposed to training ?
do you feel more composed on the court when the big points come ?
there are so many russians and some czech . sharapova and vaidisova from american school . in which sense do you think you are still czech ?
how well do you assimilate in the u.s. ? when you 're in florida , do you feel like one of the other teenagers ?
maria said she feels a little bit bi-cultural . she feels russian , but also feels when she 's in the us that she 's just somewhat of an american .
how difficult is it to change from america coming back to home ? everything is different .
in looking forward to the semifinal , do you look at previous matches , tapes of other tournaments , or do you just look at their results from this tournament ?
you played shahar once . do you think you 'd have to take a slightly different approach against her than serena ?
is serena still intimidating ?
what point do you start to contemplate being a grand slam champion ? do you start to think about that possibility now ?
did you do that at the french open ?
what was the difference between the two of you today ?
that was your best performance in a grand slam . what has that done for your confidence , and where do you think you have to improve to go to the next level ?
do you think that nicole can win the tournament ?
what in particular about clijsters makes her your pick ?
anything in particular you think nicole needs to lift a little bit to really challenge ?
serena is losing the first set at the moment , but if she were to get through and meet nicole - you played serena recently . how do you think they match up ?
nicole has never played serena before and you have recently . would you speak to her about that ?
what advice would you give ?
quarterfinal appearance , how does this set you up for the year in terms of confidence ?
so close yet so far . your thoughts on your performance .
what was going through your mind when you knew you had the opportunity of wrapping it up ?
what have you taken out of the match for future tournaments ?
is it any consolation to you that you are now the highest-ranked ever israeli female player ?
it says that you 'll go to 14 .
what is your military status ?
did you do basic training ?
what is your rank ?
private , corporal ?
but you can shoot a gun ?
after the match , serena said on court that she thought she did n't play that well . did that upset you , or were you not really listening at that point ?
were you encouraged by your cheering section ?
you play well in australia . why is that ?
you had a lot of breakpoint opportunities . do you think it was a matter of williams serving those out , or do you think there 's a bit of inexperience ? do you feel you coped with the pressure well today ?
i understand there was quite a bit of interest in your matches , people up at 4:00 this morning in israel . is that something that was building over the last couple rounds ?
now that you 've taken the basic training , when you go back , are you actually doing soldier duties or administrative duties when you 're back ?
how long will you have to be in ?
i heard you did well in marksmanship .
you were two points from the match . will that bother you for a while ?
do your goals for the year change ? will this give you confidence for later in the year ? will you sit down and think about how it can go better ?
what areas of your game do you feel like you need to improve ?
were you completely happy with your form tonight ?
you 've had 13 breakpoint opportunities and only converted 3 of them . is that a little worry ? did she get out of them well ?
what were the conditions like ? seemed chilly .
heat first , steam second , chilly now . what 's next ?
sometimes people think having a tough first-round match is a good thing , a wake-up call . at this stage of the tournament , do you look back on that and think maybe it was a positive ?
were you surprised that kim is the favorite as far as the bookmakers go ?
what does no.1 mean to you ? you 're going to reclaim that when the tournament is done .
when did you actually hear about it ?
do you like the kind of match against vera when you know you 're going to have to run and play some defense ?
movement-wise , seemed to be as well as you 've run all tournament .
you 've had some pretty tough losses here the last couple years . is that any extra motivation or incentive for you ?
no breakpoints until you were serving for the match . but what happened there ?
chakvetadze has been playing great . do you remember the l.a. match , 7-5 in the third ?
you 've been in this stage of a slam so many times in the last several years . getting over the hurdle of new york to get your second major , do you think that gives you a sense of relief going forward , that you got the second one in the bag ?
you were knocking at the door at many tournaments .
you 're saying if you were n't ready to win wimbledon 2004 , you were probably ready to win the open last year ?
now going into this year , what do you think you 're ready to do ?
what is your take on the hawk-eye system ?
it was a very good first set , but then you seemed to sort of disintegrate a little bit . what happened in the second two sets ?
why did you lose your rhythm in the third set there ? was it mentally , as well ?
can you go into a bit more detail ?
how disappointed are you at how the match went ?
were you happy with the racquets ? you kept having problems with your racquets , string tension .
it was a crucial game in the second set , the fifth game of the second set . a lot of advantage for martina . was it a turning point of the game ?
tracy austin said you 're not mentally tough enough yet . what can you do to become mentally tougher to actually win those sorts of matches ?
despite losing today against martina , are you still happy with your performance in melbourne ?
you had n't played li before . did it take you some time to work out her game today ?
were you more nervous today than what you 've been for other matches similar to that ?
she ran you around a lot in the first set .
it 's a good test of your fitness today ?
maybe the key game was the fifth game of the second set .
you 're 4-all with kim clijsters . where do you think the differences are between the two of you ?
you lost the first set in the tournament . can you talk more about what part of your opponent 's game made you most uncomfortable ? do you think she 's a typical asian player or not ?
after those six glorious years here , is the feeling coming back now ?
i was told someone is organizing a mixed double in prague , hingis/stepanek , against berdych/safarova . who is going to win it ?
such a difference between the first and second sets .
the first set , just slow to get into it ?
the difference in the two sets , the first one absolutely magnificent , but what happened in the second ?
we saw you feeling better and better each match . can you possibly say where you are in relation to your best tennis ? 80 , 85 % ?
what about the prospect of taking on martina again ?
does it give you extra confidence knowing you beat her at the same stage last year ?
you have n't lost to her since she came back . do you think this year she 'll be a much harder proposition than last year ? maybe she was a little green .
both of you have so much affection in australia . who do you think will get the majority of support ?
how comfortable do you feel here compared with other venues around the world ?
( question regarding the pressure of being a favorite to contend for the title . )
martina took three years off for injury , has come back . could you ever see yourself doing the same thing , or is this definitely ...
what about visiting australia beyond this australian open ?
you said earlier you and martina have a good off-court relationship . will you talk to each other before this game ?
any wedding plans ?
you still have to focus on winning the tournament , good memories . is there any room for sadness , knowing at the end of the week australia will be finished ?
not so good early on , but then it all changed very quickly . anything you can put your finger on that turned it around for you ?
did you step more inside the court ? is that what you did ?
so you were pretty composed out there the whole time . how does it feel to be in the quarterfinals ?
mentally were you nervous at all going into the match knowing you were playing a veteran player ?
you might have sharapova in the next round . you played her twice . did n't get the chance to play her in moscow . you almost beat her in 2005 .
can you talk about if you have to play either one , what you have to do against each other .
do you feel you 're a much better player now than you were when you lost to maria the last time you played her ?
your anticipation seems to be a strength . is this a natural gift , something you 're conscious of that you work on ?
bad days , you mean you guess the wrong way to go ?
you guess the wrong way . you seemed today to guess the right way every time .
i think there are 27 russian women and girls here competing . it 's easy for the media to think of them as a group . do you look upon the other russian girls as friends or rivals ?
is it important for you to beat them as rivals and to sort of work your way up , get a profile for yourself ?
patty did n't fight very much today . have you been surprised by her behavior ?
you 're on a real winning streak at the moment . can you ever remember being as confident going into matches as you are now ?
that 's a real noticeable thing to you , very important ?
so you 're not giving yourself a lot of credit ?
are you pretty hard on yourself ?
is that good or is that bad ?
was that more pleasing than the petrova win because you played so well ?
she said that you were a bit too steady for her .
explain how have you done this ? do you have an explanation for how you 've managed to do this , play so well ? not a whole a lot of matches in the last four or five months really .
when you played in hobart and then too here , was there a time when it sort of clicked ? i 'm back playing the way i want to play ? was there a moment ?
last time you played jelena she was yanking you around pretty good and today you were dictating . today you were more aggressive , especially with your return . talk about that a little bit .
fourth game of the second set you made two tremendous shots . pirouetting to make a half volley and then a 17-stroke volley with a backhand cross-court . i have seen you hit a lot of great shots , but those stand out .
there was a lot of carnage today in the bottom part of draw . have you looked at it , and how does that make you feel about your chances the rest of the tournament ?
well , it usually means something worse than that , people dying .
vaidisova , yes .
did you hear the birds ? they were really crying . they were trapped and --
that did n't throw your concentration off obviously .
did you have a chance to talk to margaret court since you picked up the trophy ?
yeah .
have you picked up a bit of the cold serena ?
how close are you sort of having to push things with not having the match practice to test your fitness ? obviously you 're getting rundown .
how would you compare the level of enjoyment you 're having out there to other time in your career ?
how long has it been since you had that attitude ?
serena , how good does it feel just to have your body respond to what you want it to do ?
what ?
you play your own game and you play it so well . seemed like today you made a lot of conscious choices , for example hitting to her forehand and keeping away from her backhand . was that part of the game plan going in ?
is that maturity ?
you 've continued to improve right along . if you keep it up at this rate , do you think you can go all the way ?
when is the last time you felt nervous in a match , legitimately nervous ?
stage fright ?
talk about playing shahar and what kind of game she has .
you were saying that your dad is your next biggest fan next to you . has your mom been very supportive this week ? is she taking it easy on you ?
you had a really tough match with safarova hobart .
did you see had this one coming today that she might beat mauresmo ?
did you get ahold of your dad ?
how did you think the match went ? you obviously played very well .
what do you think you did particularly well ? what was the difference in the match for you ?
who do you play now ?
have you played her before ?
are you surpassing your expectations coming into the tournament ? are you feeling at the top of your game ?
what was the best part of your game today ?
did you feel any nerves at all ?
what was it like when you walked out there , defending champion , rod laver arena , crowd full of people ?
what was your match plan before you went out ?
was it aggression that won it for you ?
was it the end of '05 , you won in the gold coast ?
at that point you looked like you were going to make a big jump . last year it did n't really happen . what has changed ?

did you sense amlie 's frustration or did you continue to focus with your own game ?
did you start to play tennis because of something or somebody in your family ?
did you feel going in against mauresmo if you came out aggressively you could unsettle her , you could make her mentally fragile if you came out and hit hard early on ?

you 're set to face serena or jelena . any thoughts on that ?
do you remember when you played serena a couple of years ago ?
how much does the small but very noisy band of israeli supporters means to you ?
what sort of support are you getting back home ? you 've made some front and back page headlines . in touch with people there ?
2006 last year , you had a terrific year . won a few titles . any significant change you 've made to your game ?
nice to be on the winning end of a three-setter against her at a slam rather than the losing end ?
down 2-5. she said you played much , much better from then on .
she played you a little differently than she did the last couple times . she was coming in a lot more . did that take you a while to get used to it ?
must be very good for your confidence to be able to get through a tough match like that .
you 've played so many three-set matches in your life . experience-wise when you go into the third set , what are the important things for you to do ?
what can you do different against kim ? lot of opportunities to do things differently against her .
do you have to play more offensive against her than you would against some other players because her defense is so great ?

a big step from here , either ivanovic or zvonareva .

tomorrow you 're going to practice for the second week . a different mentality because you know now you 're facing elite players , the pressure gets more intense .
has this tournament been the biggest physical test for you over the last couple years ?
is this a sense that you 're reaping the rewards for the off-season work you 'd done ? when you left madrid you said you were going away sort of to dedicate the next six weeks to getting yourself ready to come down here .
was that a hard decision to make , to say to all your various endorsement people , no , i 've got to work at my tennis over this six-week period ?
obviously a lot of people would like you to do appearances , to go places , have your picture taken .
yes .

you can go 10 days without thinking about any kind of tennis whatsoever ?
how much trouble do you think you were in after the first set ?
was there a distinctive turning point for you ?
how difficult is it when you 're not only playing against someone who is playing as well as she did in the first set but you 're also playing against the whole stadium ?
she was once a top 10 player . any thoughts on what she might be able to do during the course of this year in terms of rankings ?
you made the quarterfinals a few times , semifinals as well . what is your goal for this year ? one better than that ?
what happened after the first set ? you looked so good in that first set .
what do you take out of the match ?
is it that you have n't had a lot of those sort of tough matches , and she 's no.8 in the world ?
do you come out of tonight 's experience thinking you can get clear to the top 20 type player than you thought , or not as close as you might have thought a week or so ago ?
what about how you 'll reflect on the tournament ? beforehand if someone had said you 'd get a couple of wins , would that have satisfied you ?
where patty adapted in the match , do you think that 's where you failed to ?
in adapting to the match , she changed her tactics . do you think you could have done something different ?
your ambitions for the year have been enhanced by this tournament ? what had you hoped to do first of the year coming into here ?
going into the third set , were you still thinking positively ?
after this it 's off to asia ?
approaching the second week , how do you rate that win ?

yes .
does a different atmosphere make it difficult to concentrate ?
is it more comfortable for you to play this year as a seeded player doing just your job , comparing with last year , each match you were playing was a huge event ?
where do you think the improvements in your game have come from since the first week of the circuit ?
83 % .
after today 's match , how are you pleased going into the second week ?
was it a good workout for you today ?
where does the improvement come from for the second week ?
your would-be opponent in the fourth round is n't playing today . how much of an advantage is that for you ?

do you have any thought or hopes out here for your last year ?
if a way , would you like a really tough match in the next round ?
how do you see the level of your possible opponents in the next round ?
at this stage of your career , how difficult is it for your trainers , fitness people , conditioning advisors , to draw up a training program for you to get you through as many tournaments as possible ?
how would you sum up your match ?
good test of your fitness ?
lots of times in your career you played well with your back up against the wall . you were down 3-5 and it really seemed like your game went way up in the second . talk about that .
were you in a way a little surprised of what you were capable to do , or not at all ?
this is the first victory on a top ten player in two years , so can we say that serena is back ?
when are you going to film the script you bought of althea gibson ? can you tell us something about that ?
are you going to be directing or --
nadia said that she felt like you were able to swing pretty freely because you 've been in these big match appearances before and because you 've had a great career already . do you feel that way , that you have nothing to lose out there and that you can still go for your shots in pressure situations ?
did you feel her getting tight at the end of the second set ?
how did you feel physically in the third set ? were you winded at all ?
do you feel like your court speed is basically back to where you wanted to ? are you as fast as you were in your prime , or getting closer ?
so you 've stopped thinking about the knee when you 're playing ?
can you talk about jankovic , because in la she gave you a pretty hard time . just talk about the match-up there .
the match today we saw you on the screen saying something like `` call me '' on the tv camera . who were you saying call me to ?
so you think he was staying up that late to watch the match ?
you were asked whether you feel like you might have something to prove . does that make having a young up and comer like jankovic in the next round an even better sort of result for you in a way ?
you 've been asked quite often if you feel you have something to prove . you 've got a real up and comer in the next step , so it 's almost a chance , is n't it ?
at 3-5 you really just stopped missing completely . you were playing really well and got in the zone there . are you conscious of that , and does it affect the way you 're playing , knowing you 're sort of secure and going to be right on your game ?
can you talk about u.s. women 's tennis right now and being here as the one big u.s. woman that we have ?
your impressions of the game ? what did you think ?
there 's been a few different delays . how hard is that to keep yourself mentally up and about ?
what happened after the first set ?
how surprised are you that she could produce that kind of tennis ?
it seemed like once she raised her level that you could n't match it .
can you just talk about her running , because her conditioning obviously is n't 100 percent , but she 's pretty fast still , huh ?
do you think she still has the best serve on the tour ?
after beating a player as good as you , i guess it 's probably fair to say that you ca n't count her out of the tournament now , huh ?
how much does it play on your mind , if at all , that she has a pretty big career advantage on you in matches ? does that come into your thinking , or do you think it affects the situation at all ?
at 6-1 , 5-3 , are you thinking this match is on my rack or she 's coming now ?
was it a problem that the first set was so easy ?
how was the heat ?
if serena plays as well as she did in the last two sets today , does she beat jankovic ?
were you surprised in this match that she did n't fade more in the third set ?
just coming in with your seeding and given that you had a good year last year except for the couple months you were injured , is this disappointing ?
what was your plan tactically , strategically , going in against her today ?
given the question marks about her commitment , how surprised were you that she was able to produce that level of tennis ?
a long two-set match . how did you assess the match ?
a good match today if you 're to progress further in the tournament ?
would you have guessed you were going to play serena ?
do you enjoy playing in matches where you 're the favorite , the player expected to win ? is that pressure you enjoy ?
having seen serena play so well today , what can you expect when you play her ?
do you think it says more about women 's tennis or more about her that she can come back after such a long time , really not playing much , and succeed like she seems to succeed ?
have you ever been intimidated by a reputation of an opponent ?
do you think other girls do ?
you 're the fourth favorite to win this tournament . do you think you can get it ?
you lost to azarenka before when life was not so good . what does it mean ? does it show you how far you 've come ?
how is the fatigue ? you 've played probably more than anyone this year .
where do you think you lost it and where did she win it ?
was it a night of lost opportunity , do you think ?
does this count as a major blow , considering where your career may or may not be at the moment ?
is it devastating in isolation or is it devastating in a broader sense ?
remember what you said to yourself when you dropped serve first game of the third set ?
your attention can sort of shift to the doubles . you must rate your and lisa 's chances here ?
how easy is that to do , to forget what happened tonight ?
all australia 's hope in the women 's singles resting with alicia molik . have you had a chance to see how she was going ?
yes .
what is the situation with you and nicole ?
would you like to continue ?
you 've gone without a coach before .
but a match like tonight will reinforce that ?
do you enjoy the big stage , the television night matches ? are they something you look forward to ?
anything special you did between your first match and today to prepare yourself to get yourself up again after being pretty exhausted from the last match ?
how much was this the game you needed ? quick time , an hour , not expending too much .
has the harder one earlier in the week taken the edge off ?
now that you 've had some time to recover , any ideas on how they should organize the situation , the heat rule ?
you 'd like to see them stop the match and then close the roof and continue ?
you feel pretty fortunate in some ways not to have had a health problem after that first match ?
are you well enough recovered that if there was a hot day , as is going to be the next few days , you 're in another three-setter , physically you 'd be okay ?
the state of russian tennis is obviously fairly healthy at the moment . do you think there 's any real reason why there 's been so many improving recently ?
has nothing to do with training ?
what do you make of jankovic and her game ? are you surprised to see her accelerating into the top level here ?
for a long time she did n't look like she was going to let you into that match . what turned it for you ?
you seemed to play a lot more conservatively than normal for the last two sets . was it a matter of letting her make the mistakes ?
was it a matter of getting used to her game ? he had n't played her before .
do you feel like your game is in good shape possibly heading into a second week ?
so you would n't be too concerned if it heated up next week ?
how long have you been living in melbourne for and has that had an impact on your open preparation ?
south yarra ?
how has paul helped you ?
how are you doing with the fact that people want so badly for you to do so well here ?
you spoke a little bit about your movement , how you felt like you were moving better in the second and third sets . do you feel like you 're moving better now than you were two or three years ago ? how does it compare ? are you fitter now ?
it just seems like two , three , six months into the comeback , is it that movement , the physical side of things , harder than the mental side in terms of coming back ?
a fourth-round match with sam stosur , how would you feel about that ?
petrova , a top ten player at the hopman cup , may have to play patty schnyder next , another top ten player ...
i think you will agree , you did n't quite play your best today .
at some stages you could n't hit the ball .
was it hot there today ?
do you think it 's going to be a great year for serbian tennis ?
i know you knew novak when you were young . how much do you see him now ?
has he always been a big talker , somebody who enjoys talking ?
how much time do you spend in serbia every year ?
maybe a month or so a year you 're there ?
your match looked routine . was it as routine as it looked ?
must be delighted with the way the tournament is panning out at the moment ?
serena williams said the other day , she was up 4-love and what upset her was the fact that she lost focus a few games . is that something similar to you ?
a year ago you were sort of the novelty act of the tournament . everybody wondered , well , can she really do it , and can she win a match here and there and that sort of thing .
yes , of course it is . is there or is there not the pressure on you now that there was a year ago ?
did you surprise yourself with what you 've done over the year ?
i would think coming into this year your expectations must change , though , after last year ? you set new goals ?
are you playing at 100 percent of your level or do you think you have maybe another 10 , 20 percent left ?
can you feel it coming week to week ? do you say to yourself , you know --
do you find it a completely different world from the one you left ?
now that you 've seen your draw , you 're in kim 's quarter again , which is --
-- pretty difficult , huh ?
did getting engaged give you a special peace of mind ? does it make you a little more easy-going ? does it make it easier --
have you spoken to kim about what she might miss on the tour when she retires ?
can you just quickly break down mirza 's game , sania ?
kim , how do you sum up a match like that ?
wayne arthurs is playing his last australian open , and he said that he 's nice and relaxed because he does n't have to worry about his future anymore , and that 's why he 's playing good tennis . could the same be said for you ?
what are the principal reasons for you to retire ?
martina hingis has sort of joked that you and she were racing to a quarterfinal clash because you 're playing at the same times , both won your matches pretty easily . can you comment on that ?
in previous years here the crowds really embraced you as one of their own , almost their adopted daughter . do you feel that kind of embrace even today ? has it changed do you think ?
where is your level compared to the us open would you say right now , when you won in 2005 ?
which would be the main reason not to make a comeback as hingis has done ?
you 're such a flexible person . are you a good friend of stefan everts ?
would you like to have a go on a bike ?
so can we have a progress report ?
is that what you did n't like ?
what did you like ?
you served pretty well . your serves kept you in some matches , huh ?
what was the difference in the first and second sets ?
what do you mean by focus ? you were n't focused in the first set ?
so the next match is obviously a step up . you 're playing a top five player . just talk about that and how you feel going in .
do you remember the last time you played her here two years ago , three sets ?
well , talk about her game , though .
you 've played almost an hour , and suddenly you played a serve and volley point and you won the point . then you missed another one later on , but will there be more of that do you think ?
it was a long wait . i kept waiting .
it was a year ago the third round was hantuchova and now it 's petrova . how do you compare the challenge of playing petrova versus hantuchova ?
your mom said , i think it was last week , that she thinks you 're a little bit rusty . do you still feel a little bit rusty ?
can it happen that quickly ?
how different is it being in the locker room and lindsay is not there and venus is not there ? you 're getting to be one of the older ones there . does it feel different now ?
some people feel that it 's best to keep their emotions intact , like borg or someone , and you surface your emotions pretty well . does that serve you well , getting your feelings out ? when we 're filming you or looking at you , you 're pretty expressive .
has venus always been that way ?
did she have a better record when you guys played matches as a kid ?
could you see yourself playing , say , 15 tournaments this year ?
12 maybe ?
but at this stage , given the fact you have n't been able to play frequently as the last few years , could you see yourself playing every month up until the end of the year so you do n't have to take so much time off and then come back again ?
how hard is it to restore the focus ?
then you do want something ?
the dress you wore in round one , a great number of the tournament officials have n't come up and said you 're not allowed to wear it , have they ?
are there any athletes , either in tennis or out of tennis , that you kind of look to for inspiration as you try to get back to the top ?
in or out of tennis .
how difficult was it , sam , hanging around today , waiting for this match to happen ?
what did you do to keep yourself ready for the match ?
the fans that turned up to your match are fairly patient as well to stick around .
when you did get out there , it was fairly routine . were you fairly happy with how you went ?
was that nerves , losing that early break , going 3-1 down ?
do you feel a little less pressure that molik is back as an aussie representative ?
what do you know of your second-round opponent ?
yes .
you pulled up from the game okay ? no problems physically at all ?
how much physically did that game take out of you , that match ? you 've been a while coming to the press conference . did you take a while to recover ?
how tough was it ?
do you feel that once they 've reached a level where they 've decided to close the roof then they should do it regardless of a match ?
did you feel that was somewhat unfair then ?
do you think it 's putting players ' health at risk , possibly playing in heat like this ?
it 's not hard for your -- it 's the same for your opponent , but it 's not the same for the rest of the field because they are n't asked to go out and play , they 're stopped from going out . is that the unfairness of the rule ?
do you think it 's a good rule that you 've played with the roof open and other people were told not to go out and play ? do you think that 's a good rule ?
conditions aside , why was the match so tough ?
did you need an iv drip or any other special treatment after ?
when a strong favorite , as you were today , is twice two points far from defeat , what goes through your mind ? are you worried about --
people asked if you were feeling quite unwell at times today . have you ever felt that bad ? were your legs like jelly ? what was going on with you physically ?
you made some comments about supporting the tournament this time of year . considering what you went through today , would you rethink those comments ?
but considering the conditions down here at this time of year ?
were you kicking yourself after she got back to 5-all in the third , or were you just so delirious --
so when she was serving for it and she was two points from the match , were you just saying , all right , just fight or just end it or i do n't really care either way ?
do you remember how you won it in the end , any particular shots , or is it all just a bit of a blur ?
the stomach thing , what did it finally turn out to be ? and secondly , had you tried that dress out much in hot , sunny weather where you looked like you might have had a little bit of a burn ?
what was the worst thought you had during the match ?
are you confident you 're going to physically recover ?
did it ever cross your mind to stop ?
why is that ?
what was the most pleasing part of that game , apart from getting through it ?
what about your game ? your serve was working well .
got you out of trouble ?
what about your groundstrokes , other parts of your game ?
you were 5-3 down in the second . were you resigned to going to a third set ?
how you keen are you to recreate what you created in 2005 ?
was there a time in the last two years you did n't think this night would happen ?
is the comeback on target as to what you would have liked to have had at this stage ?
you said you were told . when you were out , you said you did n't know whether you would come back but you were told you would .
was there anyone that told you ?
you said after the match you had a bit of a calf complaint .
are you satisfied with the way you qualified today ?
how would you compare the level of tennis today with the level of your tennis last year at the same time ?
potentially a very difficult first match for you . are you surprised it was so routine ?
do you think that helped you ?
how do you mentally prepare for the heat ?
last year one negative in the year was you found it difficult to maintain long matches . how have you worked to combat that ?
have you done extra training or changed any kind of training ?
do your fond memories of rod laver arena help you in any way when you step out on the court ?
what are your memories of playing jennifer on that incredibly hot day ?
better way to start the tournament than that ?
must be nice to be back in the zone after everything from last year ?
do you feel a hundred percent all the way back or do you still feel like you do n't quite have the matches yet ?
what do you feel like when you hear you 're the tournament favorite a month or two back into your comeback ?
do you go into tournaments this year with a different mindset , motivation , given it 's the last time you 're doing all these things ?
would this be a special one to win ?
do you feel more relaxed this year than the previous years ?
given you have big plans for the middle of the summer - very big - is this your best chance to win the second grand slam ?
should you have won in 2004 ? do you feel like you let go of an opportunity there , the final ?
is there any circumstance that would get you to bring in a coach this year or is that completely done ?
it 's working ?
so when something 's not going right with your game ...
what pleased you most about tonight 's match ?
where do you think any improvement can come from looking forward to the next couple of matches ?
fitness okay ?
you 're saying your fitness is fine . can you win a third title ?
are you approaching the season looking at it , yes , i have to win titles , or do you think it 's going to be a long process , you 'll have to work your way back month after month , week after week ?
can you play loose and free , or is your game not at the point yet where you feel like , i 've got all my shots now ?
did you consider playing last fall after the open ? did you want to ?
when you 're in a match , how match tough do you feel compared to when you were playing more often ?
what do you mean ?
how long did it take you to get over the knee operation , both in terms of healing and that you could train properly ? seemed like for a year after it hung around .
are you confident now that it 's not going to come back ?
the dress tonight you wore , is that one of your own creations ?
is it one you 've worn before ?
there was some suggestions it would be interesting to see how your opponent coped because of the color of the dress compared to the ball . was that something you factored into your thinking ?
do you think it could be a factor with that color ?
could you talk a little about lindsay , the fact she 's moving on , having a baby .
the handbag you carried out on your left arm , is that a fashion accessory or a practical thing ?
without venus and lindsay , a number of other ex-american stars here , you 're pretty much the only game in town . do you feel that at all ?
what do you think lindsay 's legacy will be in terms of her game and the way she played it ?
what 's the second biggest thing after tennis in your life ?
when you won here in 2005 , you fought your way back . you were down in the semis and the finals . does that feel like a long time ago to you at this point ?
how concerned are you about venus ' health ? she has n't played since wimbledon .
and got hurt .
jelena jankovic last year and jelena jankovic this year are different . what 's the difference ?
big help from your coach now ?
your opponent today , the canadian girl , looked good ?
and you feel well ?
how do you try to freshen yourself up when you get a day off tomorrow ? what do you do to try to regain some energy ?
what did you tell yourself after the end of last season to get yourself motivated for this year ? did you say , yeah , now i 've really turned the corner and i belong with the other players ?
did you hear about all the fans being thrown out today , the serbians ?
do you think it 's more football fans who have gravitated towards tennis because you have players from their countries now ?
it 's hard on the other player if they 're booing double faults ?
a serb is actually playing a croat tomorrow in the men 's draw .
how did you find the crowd atmosphere in your game ?
biggest moment of your career ?
you looked to dominate pretty much all the match ; perhaps tightened up in the last few games . was it just she started to get into it ?
likely to get kuznetsova next .
well , if that happens ?
how did you go ?
what were your strengths today ?
how do you gain mental strength ?
you look like you ca n't wipe the smile off your face . what 's the feeling inside ?
you fulfilled that one . where is the next one ?
so this win today is not your final ?
a lot of young players , they celebrate an early win , forget they have to come out the next day .
has there been any injury problems the last few years or has it just been playing itfs ?
( from italian ) you went four times in a final and you lost the four finals , why ?
it was n't a question of needing to break serve out there , it was a question of needing to hold serve , was n't it ?
not to be impolite , but you had so many balls that just seemed like gimmes if you hit them over . did something cramp up in your mind ?
is n't that also because she is very quick on the court so you have to try to hit the ball maybe taking some risk , otherwise the ball will come back ?
what will you do between now and roland garros ?
the fact that you have tape on your arm was a problem for you , or not ?
what exactly is the problem with the arm ?
has this week still been perfect preparation for the french , though ?
who 's feeding the cats ?
who is feeding the cats ?
what happened out there today ?
her movement seems to be the most impressive thing , is that what you 're saying ?
( from italian ) but you are a player who can respond with balls which are difficult to play , and today seemed like it was difficult for you to do that .
can you tell us more about the problem with your breathing . when the trainer came out it looked like you asked for something and she did n't have the correct medicine .
did you have a fever during the night ?
will you play next week ?
did the breathing problem seriously affect your performance ?
did to make a difference between possibly winning and losing ?
was it sort of a strange feeling or situation to have your husband come down and advise you ?
and then do you like the system of the coach being able to come ?
two finals in a row and against a serbian player . how do you like this ?
just one week before the french you think you play your best on clay ?
you said it 's your favorite tournament , roland garros ? more than the us open that you won ?
what kind of music do you listen to ?
do you listen to music before the match ?
( from italian ) you said that you love rome and you like the city a lot . did you have the occasion to visit rome and to feel the italian crowd ? and do you know that the italians like russians very much ? and did you go to a russian restaurant in rome ?
there is one .
( from italian ) did you expect a match which was rather easy , or did you expect a tougher match ?
the best improvements of kuznetsova have been in psychologist side , in movement , in tactics ? where do you think you are improved the most ?
following your question , if a person help you the most was arantxa sanchez vicario , emilio , about improvement ?
your coach ?
( from italian ) do you have a goal for this year in your career ?
yeah .
whatever happen tomorrow in the final , do you already know what you are going to do next week to prepare for the french ?
you know jelena 's game ?
another convincing win . your confidence must be really high now on this surface .
what happened to your serve in the last game ?
this happened other times ?
to you ?
comparing to charleston where you won on clay , is this one more difficult or not ?
are all your relatives and the family 100 % serbian , because you have these eyes that could be more oriental in a way ?
grandparents ?
who is your coach now , your father ?
not anymore ?
can you give us the names of those people , sparring partner , coach ?
american ?
( from italian ) this was already asked , but she had a problem with the camera . it was an easy match . did you expect that ?
who would you prefer to play in the final , and who do you expect to play in the final ?
how do you feel physically , tired ?
what part of your game do you think you can most improve ?
the answer you gave before to him when he asked you who do you prefer , all the players always say the same thing : it does n't matter .
they 're technically different .
but each would be different .
will you play next week ?
patty appeared to use a nasal spray out there . did you detect any physical problems on her part ?
( from italian ) you have made a lot progress . it 's visible . which part of your game do you think brought you to this difference in your tennis ?
do you remember to have seen the tournament of rome on tv when maybe monica seles was playing ? did you ever think that you would have been able to reach a final one day , and what that means for you ? because rome is kind of a sort of tradition .
are you watching seles ?
when you won seven games in a row it looked like you turned the match in your favor .
did you think you would go on and win comfortably from there ?
was it that you could n't rely on your backhand ? seemed to be so many errors there .
were the conditions very tough because of the wind , because of the lack of clay sometimes ?
in terms of preparation for roland garros , do you feel as though you 're tuned in quite nicely now on the clay courts ?
are you planning on playing an extra tournament next week , or just practice ?
how confident are you going to paris ?
is it a family strategy , the fact that you come here and venus does n't , she goes istanbul and you do n't ? i mean , if there is a good preparation for roland garros it should maybe be the same for both of you . why is she doing something and you do the opposite ?
why do n't you talk together ? because you do n't want to waste time , or because you think it 's useless , or for what reason ? because normally two sisters , they talk .
what do you think was the difference between the two points ? i mean , you got down to 5-all .
you go paris to train ?
are you back to 100 percent fitness now after your groin problems ?
which is your purpose for the end of year ? i mean , if you have some plan ?
why did you play with the protection today ?
do you have any other goal apart from tennis this year that you want to do , or perform some , i do n't know , big role , or , i do n't know an actress from some movie , anything in tv , project , whatever ?
no.1 ?
congratulations . five points all in the tiebreak . that 's a match that serena always wins . why did n't she ?
you beat serena only on clay . it 's because your best surface ? worse surface ? or because you have more time to think about points ? what ?
you won easily the first wet . what happened in the second set ?
what patty schnyder is asking to tennis now in this moment of your career and your life ? which goal ? which satisfaction ?
would this be among your best wins ?
which feeling it gives you to be completely different of the other players ?
in your life you had to take many difficult decisions in different moments with the family and other stuff . how are you out of it now , if you are out ? i mean , is it everything quiet ? you have no problems ? the mind is free ? you play just play tennis , whatever ?
the next opponent will be jankovic . what kind of opponent do you think she will be ?
since i must at admit i 'm behind on the information about your life , apart from your partner and your coach and whatever , who are the best supporters of you right now ? in your family there is someone ?
who is really behind you ?
he does n't .
i just want to know about the family . if your parents and you have a relationship or not ?
sorry about that .
the name of the cats and then i 'm satisfied .
how are you playing ? pretty well ? i did n't see too much of the match .
what 's the problem there ?
too many matches ?
that 's the usual affliction .
are they heavier here ?
gotten rid of all the other russians i guess , have n't you ? you 're the only one . how are your feeling going into paris , okay ?
you 've always played pretty well there .
yeah , i think everyone does .
very good . have you had some injuries ?
well , i know anita will be glad to see you play . we have n't seen you play for a long time .
what about your opponents ?
it 's hantuchova or medina .
so fed cup is going to be at an interesting place up in the woods of vermont ?
a place called stowe , vermont .
yeah .
i imagine hard , but i do n't really know .
it was just announced yesterday .
long time between now and then . it 's a ski resort really .
no . we have to wait for the snow , but eventually it comes . that 's principally what it is . it 's a nice country . lots the fresh air . i think they have to build a small stadium for 3,000 people .
but there has n't been any tennis in that part of the country for a long time , so it 'll be nice .
who 's your captain ?
so he captains both teams ?
he might win them both this year .
russians .
if they play ?
amongst the players that are now going to play , you are the highest in the ranking . does the absence of other high players in this tournament makes your way to the semifinal let 's say stronger ? does it give more weight or does it give less weight ?
did the wind bother you , and if so , how much ?
at the beginning of the match you looked just a little bit nervous . were you ? what was the problem ?
it was a comfortable margin of victory for you . did you expect it to be closer out there ?
most of your growing up , i believe , has been on hard courts . how you taking that ? you seem to be playing like you like clay . i do n't know if you do or not .
there 's a strong possibility that you 'll be playing serena in the semifinals . how did you feel about that ? and if not , how do you feel about patty ?
you are playing very well in this tournament . what does that mean for roland garros ?
but it would be a declaration of intent for the french if you were to do well here , would n't it ?
( from italian ) which are the improvement you feel that you have really done in the last few months , and what do you feel that you can improve , that you have to improve ?
( from italian ) and which are the improvements ?
when you were a child you were left-handed ; is that true , or not ?
why did you change ?
just from training , if you want to joke , you try to change ?
you could surprise your opponent .
there are two serbian players in the top 10 in the women 's tour and one top 10 in the men 's tour . how well do you know djokovic ?
he 's a nice guy ?
after yugoslavia became serbia and croatia , croatian players were much better than serbian players . now it 's at opposite . how do you explain that ?
you think there is influence in monica seles maybe ?
congratulations .
is that fuscia ? is that what we call it ? got to report these things for my female readers .
how about a fitness report now since the last time we 've seen you . you look a lot trimmer .
she 's caused you problems in the past and she did so again today , did n't she ?
you lost your temper out there on one occasion and smashed the ball towards the line judge . it was a close thing , was n't it ?
it 's not typical is it ?
was the reason for that your serve not working well ?
if you had to say and point out the difference between the serena that won the tournament here and nowadays , what , apart from the age and different look , what has changed ?
what did you mean when you say that you expected that she will play better ? what was the point ?
you 've had a variety of ailments . do you feel that everything is pulling together now for this tournament ? i do n't know if you 're playing next week in paris .
are you playing next week ?
what do you think about your next opponent , schnyder ?
even though you do n't have a great memory but you remember schnyder and peer when you played , do you remember what is difference in the atmosphere in rome or in this tournament ? there is something new that is happening that did n't happen before ?
is there anything different in rome compared to the last time you were here ? i remember you went to all the shops . this year is the same , or not ?
i remember your bodyguard was a friend of a bodyguard of venus . are they still the same ? you still in touch ? you do n't see them anymore ?
no . you are teasing . say it again .
what can you tell us about venus , when she might be ready ?
next week she 'll play ?
in paris .
playing so well and so tough and so concentrate , you think that you could win the grand slam this year ?
it 's not easy now for you to sit . you have a problem .
did you have problem on previous days with your back , or not ?
( from italian ) that is nothing to do with the muscle ?
it 's a terrible period for many , many players .
what it means ?
( from italian ) do you think that there are too many matches to play in the schedule ?
you 've been having physical problems too . how is everything going now ?
can you see why did he ask you about your physical condition ?
i do n't have to chase dropshots though . is this a break for you ? would you have liked to have played longer today ?
it looks like your english is very nice . somebody told me you speak fluent french ; is that true ?
they told me you had a degree .
you 've been asked this a number of times , but are we going to see more and more and more russians in this game ?
part two : does that keep you eager and alert looking back there and seeing all these kids coming ?
do you agree with my friend ana ? i said to her , how come there are so many good russian players ? and ana said to me , but it is the family . the really motivation comes from the family .
what is a name of a young russian players for the future ? do you see anybody who plays very well for the next years ?
also the young players .
pavlyuchenkova ?
( from italian ) talking about your mother , who 's here on the court and off the court . is it very close relationship ? could you go on playing without her ? could you win without her ? or is it really very symbiotic between you ?
is she a good player ?
a student of the game as well as a player ?
after the big results you already had , which is the goal of this year for yourself ? i mean , you have a tournament in your mind ? you have a result in your mind , or ranking ?
when a press conference finish and the journalists do n't ask about your serve , which sort of relief do you have ?
yeah . but you ca n't give me the last answer about that , because someone says you have a problem , a physical problem there and can not do something .
because you are talking with yourself about the moment , you are thinking too much , what ?
so you give an answer that you just do n't think about it . we never hear about why your boyfriend or your husband or whatever . why ? because he does n't exist ? you did n't met the ideal man or you do n't want to show him in any way ?
we are curious . we are journalists .
very happy very saw on television .
with your interview before .
you seem to be moving pretty well .
and you 're sliding well .
you got off it to a fairly slow start . you seemed to be struggling to get the radar right in the early stages .
would you have rather been playing in the day ?
was there anything in particular that enabled you to turn it around so dramatically from that early loss ?
what about your opponent ?
did you feel frustration after 4-2 and you can not play your game ?
it has been a good start for you . because sometimes you had a worse start other tournament , also here in rome .
the tension that you had in first set , was that just routine or was there any problem to your thigh ?
yeah .
after a match like this , an hour , i mean do you go to eat ? you go to sleep . i do n't think you go to dance . but do you eat later ?
and are you surprised about so many players retired here , this tournament , so many do n't play ?
you know you are here .
what was your state of mind coming in ? you 've beaten her a lot . were you confident ? unsure ?
what do you mean , she plays well in these conditions she 's a better hot player ?
what 's the difference with those two conditions , doha and here ? can you elaborate on those .
was there ever a point in the match where you felt you could turn things around or were you just playing from the line all the time ?
how good was her level today ? i mean , was that level good enough to win , like , a slam ?
do you find the conditions between here and florida are much different ?
you both trained in the casal/sanchez academy in spain . so it was a battle between two players from this academy , and between two coaches from this academy . how much contributed to her success today , in your opinion ?
your forehand is the weakest part of her game . how was it today ?
i watched you play your opening match here . i got the feeling you did n't even want to be here . it did n't seem like you were up for that match , like you were mentally acute , you might say . then you really came on . you seemed like you had kind of a rollercoaster of a tournament . you were up and then you were down , you were up . i do n't know how you were today . is that an accurate summation , svetlana ?
how far do you think you were from your best game today ?
svetlana , does this sort of take a little bit of -- the fact that you got to the final takes a little bit of pressure off you going into next week where you 've got all winners points to defend ?
how has daniela improved this match compared to previous times that you 've played her ?
have you set a date for your coaches to play each other ?
are they fit enough or do they need a doctor to watch that match ?
what will the winner get ?
you almost got the whale trophy today by accident . is that the closest you 've come to getting the winner 's trophy when you did n't win ? today they almost handed you the whale ?
in the presentation ceremony today , the gentleman who was handling it almost handed you the winner 's trophy , the whale .
yeah .
why did you want to play in this tournament initially this year ?
congratulations . how does this compare to the first ?
why no nerves at all all day ?
daniela , do you wonder why you ca n't bring that same feeling or same approach to other tournaments ?
does it feel like a monkey 's come off your back a little bit , getting the win finally after all these years ?
can you kind of take us -- what happened with your career right after you won here in 2002 ? 'cause like when you won in 2002 , it looked like the start of some bright things . can you kind of take us through ?
not to pry , but it seemed like as soon as the match ended , you were off the side , you were calling somebody on the phone ?
so how did this conversation with your mom go ?
so how does this year 's conversation compare with the '02 conversation ?
you called her in 2002 , if i recall .
oh , she was here ?
you 've talked about the coaching before , the change from nigel to casal/sanchez , but it seems to have had a pretty profound effect on your results the last six months . true ?
pacific life likes to call this the fifth major . how do you look at it ?
when you turn your back between points and do your ritual of doing some bouncing , reflecting , what is your self-talk to yourself , what is ?
have you worked with james leher ?
is that something you picked up from jim ?
watching you play against peer , i kind of had the feeling that you have this little mantra that you go through after points . a point , finishing , your feet behind the baseline , faced the other direction from the net --
i 'm mistaken then , you do n't have any little ritual you go through ?
what was the difference between this match and a couple weeks ago against her ?
do you feel like this victory could be kind of a stepping stone for you into a pretty successful season this year ?
what are your celebration plans ?
but nothing you can share with us ?
champagne on the balloon ?
in tennis , for pro-players , time is such a funny thing . you go from tournament to tournament . does five years ago , winning this in 2002 , does that seem like a long , long time ago or just yesterday ?
so do you hope to be here in 2012 contending for the title ?
what 's the biggest single difference , psychologically , between a player who wins here and a player who struggles for quite some time ?
what 's been the biggest difference , psychologically , either in your perception of the game or yourself or of your abilities ?
in those difficult times that you just mentioned , there was so much focus on you about your physical build-ups , that match you played at wimbledon where you had all those opportunities against asagoe , and all that , and there was so much focus on you , you looked obviously maybe unhappy . was there ever a time when you thought , `` do i really need all this , do i want to continue with this '' ?
can you take a moment and talk about your role and position in bratislava and slovakia ? are you a really big deal there ? are you celebrated ?
are there other athletes who are equal to you , and if not , who 's next in terms of slovakia athletes ?
does this put less pressure on you going into the next couple tournaments or even more pressure now ?
now , you feel like you ca n't wait another five years to win again ?
what 's this match up with the coaches ?
which two coaches were that specifically ?
why is winning the second one seemingly so much more difficult than winning the first one ?
daniela , do you feel now that you 're not holding out false hope , that you might some day actually become no.1 ? does this prove to you , yeah , well , i can play big-time tennis again , maybe that 's not just a dream ?
as a junior , at what point did your dream of becoming a tennis professional in your mind become a true reality ? what was the breaking point that you said , `` i think i 'm gon na get there '' ?
svetlana obviously had a ton of problems after winning the u.s. open , which , of course , is a huge , huge event . and you had your ups and downs after your first win here . did you ever have any regrets of your first win coming so early or were you just happy ?
does that whale trophy match anything in your home ?
it appeared that the break after the second set really changed your momentum and your game was n't the same when you came back , especially because you 'd been playing very well at the end of the second . was it the heat or was it loss of momentum ?
final set , yes .
how disappointing is it to lose the match on two double faults ? is it disappointing , the two double faults at the end ?
is it disappointing to lose that way ?
she was taking a long time at the end between points .
did that bother you or is it okay ?
i think you 're the first chinese to reach semifinal of a tier i or a grand slam tournament . when you look back , do you feel it 's been a positive tournament for you ?
how did that heat affect you , because you had to take a break ? was it difficult to play in the heat ?
but you took a break and then you came back and then --
so you felt more tired today ?
what lessons do you think you learned about your tennis game from this match ? what lessons will you take ?
learn . what did you learn from this match ?
i did n't see the first set , end of the set , end of the second set . you did n't seem to have a coach there . did you have a coach there with you today ?
did he come out and talk to you after the first set ?
i think you were speaking to your husband or your coach in chinese . what were you saying ?
next time you 're playing in such heat , maybe it would be a good idea not to think of the heat . you say i think the weather was hot , so the weather was more hot , so forget it .
what was the difference , do you think , between your serving in the second set and the third set , because you served a lot better in the second set ?
during the break , did you drink a lot of water or what did you do during the ten-minute break ?
just one whole bottle ?
you 're very close to making top 10. do you think about that or not ?
is it difficult to come this close to making the final and then missing or more disappointing ?
when do you leave for miami ? today ? tomorrow ?
you did n't buy the ticket ?
where will you go shopping ?
the what ?
they make announcement in chinese .
announcement in the shopping center .
what are you going to buy ?
sounds like you 're going to spend the day .
how did you get back in it after that very long first set , tiebreaker , all those set points ?
you finished so strongly in such difficult conditions with the weather ?
what did your coach say to you after the first set ? he was very emphatic talking to you , saying what , maybe go down the line more with the forehand ?
so what about daniela ? you 've played her seven times . you 're up 5-2. you won the last time . she beat you in zurich , i believe . you both had the same coaches , which is even more fascinating .
coaches . she was casal/sanchez , too .
5-2 .
now , when you beat her so recently , how much confidence does that give you ?
when you look at her career and her talent , does it surprise you she has n't won more titles ? she won her several years ago once .
uh-huh .
svetlana , in the beginning or it seemed like you were limping a little bit . you seemed like you were n't walking around all that well . were you having more problems with your foot ?
maybe i was -- no ?
you played , as i remember , for something like two hours and 39 minutes in that heat . how much can you have left for tomorrow ?
do you run into daniela frequently in barcelona ? i know she does n't spend quite as much time there .
what is the name of the coach you 're talking about here ? `` my coach has been coaching her coach . '' which coach are you referring to ?
s-t-e- --
stefan ortega ?
so , svetlana , clarify , you said that the two coaches have to play each other now ? is that what you said ?
on a clay court ?
back at the academy ?
not here ?
who 's gon na win ? your coach or daniela 's ?
when is this match gon na take place ?
whole match two-out-of-three or three-out-of-five ?
just your general thoughts about the equal pay about the french open today ?
you turned it around pretty quickly from the second and third set , so what were some of the key things you did there ?
she looked like she might have been more affected by the heat than you or did you see that ?
how did the heat affect you ?
what did you do during the break exactly ?
you have been on the court for many hours this week , including five hours and 12 minutes just in your last two matches . how tired are you ?
so what does it mean to you to be back in the finals kind of where everything really started going a few years ago ?
you 've had a lot of ups and downs between then and now . can you describe how you 've changed since you were last here and won in 2002 ?
what were some of the lessons that you 've learned ?
how about off the court ?
kind of following up on that , does that sort of -- does it seem to be curbing your perfectionism ?
you do n't appear to be carrying too much weight around . do you suppose your body type might enable you to resist the heat better than others ?
how does your coaching situation work now , daniela ? you 're listed as having various coaches . are people kind of coming in and going out and you 're having different coaches for different surfaces ? how is it actually working ?
do you spend a bit of time at the academy as well ?
you mentioned before that you learned how to win matches without being 100 percent . was that the case today ?
what 's the major difference between nigel and sanchez/casal , or let 's just say emilio ?
so is your personality to rush through things or is your personality before to say , `` well , this ball '' -- `` i can hit any ball for a winner , so i do n't really need to be patient '' ?
how do you learn that or how do you learn not to be a perfectionist ?
you mentioned off the court lessons . can you give specific examples of what types of things ?
you 're only 23 and yet you seem to have been around for an awful long time .
do you actually think that your best years , with all the experiences that you 've gained , all the things that you 've been through , that perhaps your best years are still to come ?
you look a little stronger than you used to be . you seem to be moving better on the court . is this something you had to really work on ?
can you talk about playing svetlana , if you play her . she has given you problems in the past and recently this year , so what kind of challenge does she present to you ?
so what does sanchez/casal academy do when you two play each other ? do you switch ? the same person comes and tells you guys different things ?
given that , are you supporting murray in the men 's ? he 's another graduate of casal/sanchez academy ?
what if it happens to be sybille bammer ? what are your thoughts on that match ?
i notice in the final set , you added something , some powder to your drink .
what it was ? i 'm asking because i 'm playing in the media tournament .
could you arrange me ?
before the third set , exactly what -- before you went in , had the bananas and the electrolytes , how were you feeling exactly ? i mean , your legs felt heavy or you just felt exhausted ?
i was wondering if you 've ever been able to watch the tape of your final against martina hingis here , and if so , what do you think when you sort of see yourself from back then ?
do you feel much older now ?
pretty close match out there today ?
i had the feeling that was a match of exceptionally high quality . what do you think ?
a couple days ago martina hingis , your match was the -- she felt you were the best player of the young generation , like upcoming players . how do you feel ?
do you look at that match in any way in your own mind as a missed opportunity ?
the first time you played her other than in a grand slam tournament . does that change the ambiance , so to speak , the environment of the match , that is ?
in one game you resisted three match points . when you do that , do you kind of get the feeling that , maybe , well , this is going to be my day ?
you had a rather unusual shot that was headed out and hit the net and bounced in for a win are . did that perk up your spirits at one point ?
what kind of pressures do you feel , being so young and having people like , you know , other people say that you 're the best player of the next generation . when you stop and think about it , what --
is there just tennis ? i know you have a clothing line , too , or who deals with that ? do you ever have to think about that ?
what did you think of the quality of that match ? i thought it was extremely high , but maybe i 'm wrong . what do you think ?
you only won three of ten breakpoints , so you did n't break her every time , but you won , which is a big thing . in the one game toward the end of the match , you had three match points that escaped you and you lost that game . when that happens , svetlana , is it difficult not to feel , well , maybe this is not going to be my day ?
are you saying you had to have a toenail removed ?
i got it . that nail was on what foot ?
was that your big toe ?
you 've played her a couple times before . is this the best that you 've ever seen her ?
this is the first time you 've played her when it was n't in a grand slam tournament . does that kind of change the atmosphere a little bit , svetlana ?
do you feel mentally stronger than she does at the end of a match ?
about this time last year , you were talking about the fact that you had spoken to yourself and said , `` i 've got to change things . i 've got to start producing the results , '' and you seem to have had a fresher outlook with your tennis . you went onto win miami . do you think , as you look back over these last 12 months , you 've got to a place where you want to be or you should have been further ahead ?
then how would you explain sharapova winning two grand slams and getting to no.1 at such a young age , 'cause it did n't take her quite as long ?
but you also -- you won a grand slam title when you were young , too . and sharapova said maybe when she won her first , she was n't quite ready .
it just sort of happened to her . do you feel that way also ?
what 's the easiest thing to work on when you 're trying to improve your game and what 's the hardest ?
is it about confidence ? is it about dealing with the grind of the tour ? what 's the hardest part of the mental side ?
so what are your expectations for this year , now , three months into the year ? what are your expectations ?
i do n't know if you talked about this before , what 's lacking in vaidisova 's game to go from maybe a top 10 player to a top 5 player ?
talk about the next round against either tatiana or bammer .
could you imagine being a mother and traveling with a baby and playing at the level you play at ?
it makes it sort of amazing what bammer is doing . she 's only 25 , traveling with a 5-year-old , you know , tournament to tournament . now she 's gotten into the top 35 , her best ranking ever , with a baby .
i think she was below 140. when she started to come back after she had the child she was out of the top 100 ?
her best ranking before , i do n't think she was ever top 50 ?
you would n't travel if you had a child ? you would n't play tennis if you had a child ?
it 's not a dog , svetlana .
did your mother ever bring you to the races ? do you remember ever going ?
environment ?
is it true you were born on the back seat of a bike ?
very good come-back there . what was the dynamics as you saw it ?
you seemed to take a lot of momentum from your discussion with your coach . did you win seven games in a row or something after seeing your coach ?
but was that a factor for you ? did it make a difference , your discussion .
are you comfortable sharing what that was ?
are you comfortable sharing what you discussed ?
what was going through your mind when she was serving for the match ?
could you just on talk of what you were saying about coaching , could you compare the difference in how it feels to be out there on your own compared to being able to have a coach come out ?
what 's your coach 's name ?
how long has he been your coach ?
what is the best quality that he has brought to you ?
can you talk about what this win means for your year , obviously to beat the defending champion at such an important tournament .
when you do look back your tennis career years from now , what would you like to see ?
have you looked forward to the next match or did you just , you know , not anticipating ? how do you feel about the next match up with na li ?
are you going to have a slightly different strategy against her ?
what is the strategy against maria ?
how many times did you play sharapova in the past and what did you change in your game ? what works in your favor today ?
how much has sam helped you control your emotions on the court , or has it been a combination of that and your own maturity ?
so much of the tour is here in the -- or a good chunk of the tour is here in the united states . what do you think the most wonderful thing is about the united states and what do you like the least ?
and the best hotels on the entire tour are in what city ?
can you talk a little bit about the match today . seemed surprisingly routine for you .
do you think training out here kind of helped you deal with the heat today ?
daniela or martina next up . could you comment , please .
a few other regions in the world where desert has been transformed so markedly , here in the coachella valley and israel . is that striking to you in some way , and do you see any similarity in the desert climate ?
no , just does it strike you how the desert has been transformed in the same way --
yes .
did you take notes today of maria 's match out in center court ?
all right .
when during your match did you find out about maria ?
but with that result , does it feel like this tournament is kind of opening up a little bit and becoming an opportunity ?
it 's been said that your training in the israeli army was important , that there would be no better way to learn discipline than doing that . could you talk a little bit about your time in the army ?
so the army was n't too bad ? it was pretty easy after all the training you have with your coach ?
do you know much about when jose won this tournament or has he mentioned that to you at all ?
he never told you anything about it or him winning it or anything like that ?
i noticed in the match , it seemed like chakvetadze was having trouble with some of the sort of loopier balls . did you pick up on that , as well ? did that figure into your game plan at all ?
you 're the only player from israel on the women 's tour --
well , you know , prominent one . you see so many other countries that have got a few players and tend to stay together . how do you find it ? do you find it difficult on the tour ? do you feel any pressure because you 're the most prominent one from there to be producing results ?
what really caused you to feel the result or forced you to make a breakthrough ? it 's been over the last year or so you 've taken the stride , the step up in the ranking and started to produce the results . what do you suggest was the breakthrough for your turnaround ?
so do you think it was important for you to take that gradual step out of juniors ? one of the two or three best juniors in the world , and then gradually working your way through , do you think that 's grounded you ?
do you think that 's what 's kept your feet on the ground , rather than , like you say , from 200 to 1 in the ranking ?
is the top 10 your main focus right now ?
best thing about jose as a coach , the single best thing about him ? he 's a tremendous tennis mind and coaching talent , but what is the best thing about him ?
specifically what is the best quality , best thing about traveling the tour as an israeli , what is the best thing ?
what is the best thing about traveling the tour as an israeli , coming from israel , the best thing ?
while you have been working with jose , have you met a young girl that jose is also coaching named coco vandeweghe ?
what do you think of her potential ? have you hit with her ?
what do you think of her ?
what part of your game do you have to improve the most to jump up a few positions on the ranking ?
did you get much support or funding from the itf to develop ?
mm-hmm , as a junior , i 'm talking as a junior . no ?
you know , the media has focused a lot on you being from israel . do you feel that the media makes too much of your nationality , you know , as you were saying , like whether you 're from spain or u.s.a. ? does n't matter when you 're on tour ? do you think the media makes too much of it ?
what is the your rank in the israeli army or what was your rank ?
like corporal , pfc ?
what are you ?
so you had no ranking in the israeli army ?
private ?
did that seem surprisingly routine for you ?
can you just talk about your match today and describe how it went for you and how excited you are to be at the quarter finals .
and when did you notice that your opponent had some sort of injury ? at what point in the match did you start thinking that ?
and when was that in the match ? the first set ? second set ?
the first game ?
i think you must have felt that if you won today , you would be playing sharapova . instead you 're going to be playing zvonareva who beat sharapova . have you had previous matches with zvonareva ?
have you played zvonareva before , your next opponent ?
are you also surprised that you are not playing sharapova ?
i got it . but have you been looking at the draw and saying , `` okay . if i win here , my next opponent '' -- because your next opponent would have been maria sharapova , but she just lost ?
do you feel like the tournament is opening up and becoming an opportunity for you to maybe win a tier 1 ?
you 're the first chinese woman to be ranked in the top 20. do you think your success on the wta tour is doing something for developing tennis in china with younger girls ?
can you repeat that . i did n't catch that .
how do you like palm springs and how does it compare to life for you ? how do you like palm springs and how does it compare with life at home ?
you said the other day you were having some trouble coping with the heat . how have you adjusted to the heat ? you seem to be adjusting to it now . and how do you keep yourself hydrated before and after matches ?
are you coping better ? are you getting used to the heat now more ?
can you talk a little bit about how having your own choice of -- having your husband as a coach sort of helps you on the tour ?
well , just talk about you coaching situation and does it help you now having him on the tour ?
you 're the first chinese to reach a grand slam quarter final at wimbledon . can you talk about how that helped your confidence ? she 's the first chinese to reach a grand slam quarter final .
today larry was talking about high-level tournaments like this one . there 's going to be two mixed ones and one was probably going to be in asia and we suspect maybe beijing or shanghai . can you kind of talk about china getting a major tournament like this and also about the growth of tennis in china .
do you ever think china could have a big event like this tournament or like as big as the miami event ?
you 've already had a tennis match in your series in china , right ? so you 've already had a major event in china , shanghai .
yeah , right .
how much is the olympics going to be a focal point for her in terms of trying to succeed .
you just could n't get control of the match , huh ?
she seems to play with a lot of confidence against you , too . she pushes further inside the court .
she kind of made her name against you here a few years ago . how does she compare now as a player to back then ?
did you say you lost your nerve in the two sets when you were ahead , you know , inability to close the deal ?
it 's frustrating though , huh , the process of getting back to where you 're able to do the things you want to do and you used to do ?
daniela is the only player left who 's won this tournament . how important do you think experience in winning this tournament , how much of an advantage do you think that is going forward for daniela ?
it 's her only title .
nothing great , no ?
i mean , you 're a student of the game . i 'm sure you obviously were aware of the things that happened in the draw today . so is this really disappointing considering how things have opened up with maria losing , et cetera ?
the on-court coaching , does that make it more of a level playing field for everybody , does it take away some of the mental side of the game ?
when we spoke before the tournament , you were not very happy with the past two tournaments in dubai and doha . now i do n't think you will be happy with the result here .
the grand slams , the best players tend to win . it 's rare you see someone out of the top 5 in the women 's game win it . but outside of that , you have tournaments like this and other tier i 's where some of the younger ones or the veterans get through . is there real depth to women 's tennis or is it just outside of the grand slams where there 's real depth ?
so here this -- ivanovic might be still left or vaidisova or peer or golovin ?
who in that group do you think is gon na be the better one , or who 's the really good one ? who 's caught your eye ? peer , ivanovic , vaidisova ?
after today and last week , where would you evaluate where hantuchova 's level is right now ? do you think she 's good enough to break in the top 10 ?
when you say she knows the game , do you mean she 's smart ?
did today feel anything like 2002 ?
exactly what were you thinking when she had break points on any of the second sets ?
daniela , she says that you read her game very well . she knows your game , but you really know hers well , and you seem to anticipate the shots she 's playing ; is that true ?
so it 's hard to trick the other player . it 's almost all about execution of shots ?
she also said that she , when she plays against you , she feels that you 're at the same level as the williamses and davenport and capriati ; how do you feel about that ?
she said one of the reasons why you have n't won titles and made the big push is just belief at the very end of some matches . would you agree with that ?
could you go a little bit more into depth on just what you were thinking out there on the court . it must have been pretty special .
how do you avoid the so-called natural letdown after a big win like this , meaning , in your next match against peer , who 's a very good player , she 's obviously not hingis ?
outside of today 's match , do you feel any similarities to 2002 ? if i remember right , there was a lot of upsets in 2002 , as well .
because you 're the last player here who 's won this tournament , how much of an advantage do you think experience like that is ?
is there any surprise , though , when this many seeds lose in one day , lots of the big players , i mean , one after another ?
and the heat , too ?
you would seem to have a favorable draw ?
what is your history against bartoli ?
how do you assess your game at this point ? how do you think you 're hitting ?
i saw you play maria in a world team tennis match in newport beach when you were about 14 years old . do you remember that ?
you won ?
i got the feeling you were trying very hard that night .
did you take a lot of confidence from winning that set against maria ? she had just won wimbledon and that was her first appearance after winning wimbledon .
that was prior to vancouver , was n't it ?
were n't you playing for the team from sacramento ?
the sacramento capitols ?
did you talk about the match today , nicole ?
did you talk about the match at all ?
so just talk about how you played until she got sick .
could you tell she was getting sick there in the second set ?
how do you gauge your level overall this week ?
what do you like about it ?
did you get hurt after paris ?
yeah .
so how come the -- why did you take so much time off ?
so these periodic breaks are maybe even more important than the bigger off-season , just make sure you 're taking your weeks in between the big runs ?
so just talk about your feelings coming off of australia , and obviously you played great up until the semifinals , but maybe not your best there . so what were you thinking reflecting back on the tournament ?
were you surprised how good she is , and how impressed are you by how she serves and returns , serena ?
what did it tell you about your own game when you got off the court , about some things you maybe need to do to get to that level ?
so now that you 've cracked the top 10 , what 's the next goal for you ?
in her two matches here , maria sharapova has now had a total of 97 errors . does that encourage you that you might have an even better chance of winning this tournament ?
have you played bartoli ? ca n't remember ?
would you have seen her ?
so it 's going to be a pretty hard-hitting match there , huh ?
talk about your watch deal . that 's pretty big for you , huh ?
off court , do you have a rivalry with maria in the advertising business ?
did that say to you , nicole , when you got the watch deal , though , because that 's a pretty big company , `` wow , i 've really come far in my life . this big company wants me to represent them '' ?
is that a citizen or not ?
it is . what kind ? identify --
already , huh ?
do you like the watches ?
they give you a whole case of watches when you sign ?
did you give any presents to your dad , mom ?
can you explain the question why do you wear a watch during matches ?
you mean , if you ca n't see the clock across the court ?
you got diamonds in that watch ?
you 've had matches this year against serena . you 've had two against vaidisova . you 've had matches against mauresmo , petrova . was that match you just played as difficult as any you played this year ?
what sort of injury did you have after paris ?
which shoulder ?
but you 're left-handed ; right ?
how did it feel today ?
congratulations on your run in paris . what kind of confidence do you get from these wins , especially from justine in the semi finals , this wins ?
what would you say of all the top 10 players you 've beaten this year , there 's been a few , which is your best victory of the top 10 players you 've beaten ?
i think the point could be made that in that tournament in paris , when you defeated vaidisova , kuznetsova , and hennin in consecutive matches , i would argue that that 's the best run of any woman in the world this year . would you agree ?
what kind of chance do you give yourself to win this tournament ?
i notice that the fellow who 's been identified as your boyfriend was watching you play today . is that -- do you like that or would you prefer he go someplace else ?
so after matches he will help you analyze your game and maybe suggest some improvements ?
what are your goals for this year since now you 're like -- you 've beaten good top 10 players , and what do you expect for the rest of the year for yourself ?
can you tell us what happened with the back and the injury in the first set there .
seemed like you did it on one play . she hit a cross-court and you were going the other way and leaned back . did you feel it at that moment ?
how did you feel coming into the match ? was it painful coming into the match at the start , or did it get progressively worse ?
when did you originally hurt it ? when originally did you injure your back ?
you were very emotional at the end there . was it disappointment to play so hard this week and then miss that ?
how does this affect you for the open ?
can you ask for a late start for the us open ?
i saw sveta was sitting and speaking with you after the match . what did she say to you ?
you got to feel like this was a great week for you though .
at what point did you know definitely know you could n't finish the match ?
is it the first time it 's happening to you ?
no . the problem with the back .
same thing ?
do the physios think it 's just the number of the matches that you 've played in a week , or is it something more serious ?
is it the kind of thing where it hurts in one certain , if you move a certain way , or is it kind of always there ?
before having this problem do you think that you could play your best tennis here in new haven ?
best tennis ever ?
did you have any family here to the tournament , relatives ?
have you called home ?
three consecutive matches where your opponents have retired . is it the curse of kuznetsova , or what 's going on ?
how strange is it to win a tournament like this with three straight retirements ?
this is the fifth final this year and your first win . talk about how it feels to win one .
did agnes surprise you at all in the first set how well she was playing ?
agnes said afterwards that you made her laugh . what did you say to her ?
she said you made her feel better afterwards .
you must have felt that , you know , you have had the drop out of matches early because of this so you probably knew how she felt , and it must be so tough when have to do something like that at this level .
you must have a good sense of how hard it is to have to retire , and she 's young and coming up and everything . it must have been helpful for her to hear from you .
can you talk about how you are going into the us open ? are you playing some of your best tennis ? are you confident going into next week ?
svetlana , when you do win like this , do you actually feel like you won ? do you know what i 'm saying ? three retirements in a row .
when you see her with the trainer do you change your game ? you had a couple drop shots immediately in the second set .
the us open obviously has good memories for you . do you get excited now or have you been excited for a few weeks about the prospect of returning there ?
nobody seemed to want to win a serve there in the third set . how did you manage that ?
how does to feel to be in your first final ?
is your back sore or is it just ...
you were still hitting the ball pretty well and overcoming that .
when she broke you at 5-4 and the racquet flew out of your hand , what was going through your head at that point ?
what do you think the key to your like great run this year has been compared to the years before ? have you improved certain aspects in particular ?
have you played kuznetsova before ?
you seen her play obviously . what do you think the key will be to beat her ?
what is the plan for your back tonight and tomorrow . are you getting some treatments ?
will you take painkillers ?
will you take any painkillers ?
can you describe this week just in general what kind of a week it 's been for you to just keeping advancing ?
do you think you 're exhaustion right now will make you sleep well tonight , or will your excitement keep you up all night ?
the players that had matches this afternoon , just about all of them , said the heat got to them . if it 's that kind of day tomorrow , do you anticipate possibly having problems , or will that not bother you if it 's a steamy hot day like it was today ?
i apologize for asking this if you 've already been asked , but can you talk real quickly about the match you just had and what went so well for you in the second and third ?
how much of a factor was the crowd ? it really seemed to be on your side .
second day in a row a match ends for you with retirement . are you okay with it ending a little early today though ?
do you have that sense when she 's not feeling good to just jump all over that killer instinct , if you will ?
this will be your fifth final of the year .
what do you have to do to win one final ?
do you worry about getting over-tired for the open , or is that not a factor ?
do you get more excited to play elena considering you guys are from russia , you 're similar , you 're careers are similar : same amount of money and same amount of singles titles . do you find yourself more pumped up when you play her ?
yeah . eight to seven i think it is .
so are you saying she 's old at 25 ?
can you talk about your physical fitness . i mean , you seem to be in really good shape this year and you were saying you did n't feel as tired as she looked .
are you a yankees fan or are you just color coordinated .
what did you elena say to you when she came over ? did she apologize for not being able to carry on ?
how are you feeling ?
when did you start feeling bad ? was it in the third set ?
do you find yourself , when you 're playing svetlana , raising your game a little bit ? because you guys seem to have similar careers if you look at the titles , the amount of money , you 're both from russia . is there a sense that you want to beat her more than somebody else sometimes ?
you were serving so well in the first set and then by the third set things had gone downhill . what happened there , and was it the illness part of that ?
is that the first time that kind of thing happened to you ?
talk about that point in the third set where she ripped the winner by you and you kind of went down and just took a seat for a little while .
what makes her so tough ? does she seem to get better the more she plays ?
are you two close off the court ? do you share much beyond tennis ? are you close friends ?
six matches in seven days . are you tired yet ?
there was one point early in the second set that seemed to go on forever . i mean , you took a breather . did it seem like it was three weeks ?
it was 2-1 i think at the time in the second set .
my memory is terrible .
when you get into a point like that , does it get you more fired up ? because , i mean , it must have been going back 15 times , back and forth ?
you had that other one later on too when you finally broke her at the end of the second set .
you gave a big fist pump at that one .
i know your goal at the start of every tournament is to go as far as you can , but are you , yourself , surprised at how far you 've gone in this tournament ?
are you surprised how quickly you 've moved up the rankings ?
i guess playing in italy when you won , what did that mean to get that first win for you , that first tournament win ?
in palermo .
what do you know if your possible opponents for your next match ?
they 're playing this afternoon .
neither one ?
do you feel like an unknown ? i mean , do you think you 're still sneaking up on people that do n't know how good you are ?
so what happened ?
so when did it first get hurt ?
how concerned are you about being ready for the us open , or is that the reason ?
so are you hopeful you 'll be ready ?
is it the left one ?
are you disappointed ? did you think you were playing well this week ?
this injury was different from the one you were calling the trainer for ?
did you say this was the left leg ?
okay . do you remember how you hurt it last week ? did you turn it ?
i 'm not a doctor , but i do n't understand . when you 're running you feel the pain ?
how were you able to rebound from 4-love down ?
how do you consider the level of your game after that , when you started to really play well after 4-love ?
did the hard court give you an advantage over her ?
when you went to change your clothes , i think it was after the first set , her coach came out . i was wondering if you noticed anything different that she was doing ?
how are you feeling with your game overall after this summer ?
the last few years you 've been so consistent , and this last six months a little bit up and down . has that been because you 're changing parts of your game or working on different things ?
are you feeling happy with your serve ? i have n't seen you play live for a long time , but it looks like it 's much more fluid a motion .
when you work on such an important part of your game , is it difficult to concentrate on work on everything else as well ?
i know you and svetlana have played each other many times before . does that help or hurt ? what kind of an impact does that have .
you and your fellow russians , you seem to like new haven . is there a reason why y'all play so well ?
so what did you do on those match points to get through ?
the third set just went through very easily . was she kind of down emotionally after that , do you think ?
can you talk a little bit about the tiebreak . it was 10-8 .
can you look forward to tomorrow ?
she 'll probably be just as tired as you are . she 's played seven matches in six days or six matches in six days or something like that .
you said you got a little bit lucky today in your match . how so ?
what game was that on ? was it match point ?
today .
what do you think changed when you were up 4-0 to when she started getting those games ?
you faced her four times this year already .
is there anything she did particularly well today that she did n't do well the first three times ?
you called for a trainer after the first set .
overall are you pretty pleased with your preparation for the us open ? seems like you 've been improving over the summer , right .
you seem to be bouncing on your toes a lot . you 're father taught you a certain method than the ball was underneath your foot and that encouraged you to be on your toes more ?
how 's your shoulder ? and you were saying you almost did n't play this tournament ; is that true ?
how different was jelena 's mental game compared to the other players you played ? she went after everything you gave her . did that push you more or did that kind of worry you ?
what exactly did they do to your shoulder to make it good ?
is it like ice and massage and things like that ?
how close were you to perhaps pulling out ?
after losing at wimbledon , how important was it for you to win the rogers cup here ?
that long 11th game in the second set . is that one of the more exciting games you 've had before ?
what did you think of the crowd today ? it was a packed stadium , but there were a few loud mouths , did they disturb you at all ?
what will you do leading into the us open ?
where do you find the fight on a day like this where , you know , last night you 're not sure if you 're even going to be able to play ? and there were so many moments in the first set and second set that you had to , obviously , fight back to get back in the match .
today it almost seemed like you were teasing yourself . you 'd get to a point and you 'd have a little setback , and come out and dig yourself a little hole .
so was it more a matter of just being mentally getting adjusted in that first set or did you make it physical ?
is it more rewarding to win a match like this , and fight back in a match like this when the level of tennis is as high as it was today , especially in that 11th game ?
you 've played jelena so many times over the last year - starting with the semifinals last year at the us open . as has her game changed at all or her mental approach changed ?
is there anything that was n't there when you faced her a year ago ?
you played very well against justine . the rallies were really long and a lot of her points were off of your unforced errors . even though you had the game in control at many times , did that get frustrating ? or did you keep a cool mind even after the unforced errors ?
sure . i wanted to know if you were frustrated for getting the ball out a lot . you had the game in control , but you got balls out . did that get frustrating at all ? were you mad ?
did you feel support from the crowd today ? from the fans , did you feel support ?
do you plan to play regularly in singles now in addition to the doubles on the tour right now since your performance this week was very good ?
are you going to play in singles at the us open , for example ?
what changed at 3-3 in the first set ? what changed at that point in the game for you and for justine ? what happened so she was more dominant ?
you had problems with a bee during your service ? was that it ?
coming back to last year -- you were playing more doubles than singles . was it because your federation asked you to concentrate on doubles or was it your own decision ?
how has this week been for you in toronto ?
and to play ana , defeat ana and to play justine in a semifinal , tier 1 event , what 's it mean to you ?
sorry , what was it like today to step on the court against the world no.1 ? you seemed relaxed , fairly relaxed to play the world 's top ranked player ?
what is your goal for the long-term in singles ?
like instead of ranking in a year , what would you like to be your ranking in singles ?
what do you have to work on right now to make sure that you 're better and better at each game ? is there one thing that you have to work on ?
so it 's more mental than physical ?
are you going to play many tournaments till the end of the year ?
in the fourth game you took control of the game by coming into the net . it looked like you had many opportunities later in the set where you controlled the point , but you chose not to come into the net . why was that ?
congratulations on your win earlier today . i was just wondering first of all , what were the coaches or what was your coach telling you after the first set ?
yeah , like i noticed she was n't running very well . was that part of your tactic or were you trying to drive her into corners , maybe her backhand or forehand or did you just play with a general idea of what you wanted to do ?
also on a different topic . you have a great record in doubles , two grand slams back in 2006. are you hoping to continue focusing on doubles or are you trying to alter your focus on to singles right now ?
you want to continue both ?
did you know bartoli was feeling a little ill ? could you tell ?
you could n't tell like after the first set that maybe she was sick , because she said that she has a virus . i was just wondering , could you tell during the match if she was getting sick or anything like that , or slower ?
have you ever had a week like this ?
have you ever had a week like this in singles ?
when organizers asked you to qualify for the tournament , did you even think that you had a chance of making the semifinals ? or were you even thinking i might not even qualify for the main draw ?
so you 're here to compete in the doubles regardless ?
were you here to compete in doubles ?
but if you did n't get into the singles draw , you were going to just do doubles , that was the plan ?
are you nervous about facing justine tomorrow , the world 's no.1 player ?
what would mean more to you - winning a single 's title here on tour or playing in china in the olympics ?
are you excited about next summer ?
what would be your game plan for tomorrow either against henin or petrova , depending ?
what would be your favorite surface to play on ? because you have a very fast --
also , you were amazing at the net . do you have doubles to thank for that , all of your practice in doubles , because your volleys and your smashes are just great ?
in your bio , it lists that you enjoyed jimmy connors ' sense of humor . what about jimmy connors and his sense of humor do you enjoy so much ?
we were just having an interview , and she was saying that both of you guys seemed to be kind of out of it . lot of unforced errors . is there anything that you can see how your mentality change d from the first set to the third set at all ?
your mentality during the second set , was there a change of mentality at all for you frustration-wise ? or were you just playing the same way throughout the game ?
you tried to push golovin around the court . i saw that you made her run a lot . and she did n't sometimes even attempt to get some of the drop shots that you gave . was that part of your mentality to try to , you know , make her run as much as possible ?
you were stretching your lower body . is there something wrong having trouble planting on your shots , is that why you were missing so badly ?
but was it a hip or a thigh ?
does the wind make it really harder in this tournament than in other tournaments . because since monday , pretty much all the players are saying there 's a lot of wind and it 's very difficult . is it harder here than in other tournaments ?
is it the worst tournament , like wind-like in all the season , in terms of wind ?
when you stretched several times on the court and you almost did the splits , are you okay there ? or is that , are you used to doing that ?
are you okay ? i was wondering if that would have affected your game at all ?
how do you assess your chances going into the us open ?
so in your own mind , are you one of the favorites ?
did you not expect too much coming in here your first tournament since wimbledon ?
what did you do in the break between wimbledon and now ?
so no vacation ?
three days ?
oh , few . what do you do on vacation for a few days ?
how do you think the wind affected the play today ?
do you think you handled it better than she did today that that was one of the reasons you won ?
why do you think it was so difficult to hold serve today ? it seemed like it was more easier to break than to hold ?
you 've had great results the last three or four tournaments . what do you think the difference is to get the success now ?
i 'm not that familiar with your career . but do you think this is the best you 've been playing ever ? or is this one of the best times in your career ?
she does n't remember the names of the people ?
svetlana , two matches on hard court now . are you feeling comfortable yet ?
you 've been pretty consistent this year . a lot of finals , but you have n't won a title yet . is that something that 's on your mind ?
what do you think is missing ?
on the other hand , you 've had some success against players that are ranked no.1 in the world , and i think you 've won four matches against players that have held that ranking . how do you explain that ? do you go into those matches a little more loose and confident ?
you 've had a little bit of success against justine as well . what would you attribute that to ?
are you thinking about going back to the corn rows at all that you had at wimbledon ?
are you going to have something for the us open , something different ?
you have to think about it ?
a lot of players have been sick the last few weeks . when something like that is going around the locker room , are you extra careful ?
i spoke to rosanna de los rios at the french open , and she said sometimes you hit with her daughter anna . have you hit with tina ever ?
she 's a bit older ?
do you play tennis ( talking to child ) ?
just wanted to know if you played -- did you have a tactic after watching your opponent ? i noticed some of the running was off , and i noticed a few times you hit shots in the same area just to keep her like she 'd go back to the middle . you would hit in the same area . did you form a tactic or did you just think , i 'm just going to play and not think about this ?
was the wind really bad in the first serve ?
does this wind kind of like erase in your mind the defeat in italy for you ? is it kind of like it helps you out in your psyche somehow ?
sure . you could n't possibly have thought it would be this easy though to be here , and that must be really good for your confidence ?
could you compare the environments to being in italy with the fans and being here ? do you think there was any comparison at all to make ?
is there anyone you would like to particularly face in the finals or are you just going to get --
okay , i 'm assuming . hypothetically . did you have , going into this , were you thinking i 'd really like to play this person or do you take it day by day ?
i read on the wta website , i do n't know if this is still true , are you still currently without a coach ?
just tell us what happened out there today ?
what went wrong with your game today ?
because it 's here in canada , how disappointing is it for you to go out like this ?
not a big deal to lose in canada ?
what do young players like yourself need to do to get better and improve and take the next step ?
but is there something tennis canada could do to help you get to that next level ?
how will that help young tennis players having this academy in montreal and toronto ?
you 've never played her before . can you talk about what you were expecting and how it was ?
can you talk about your feelings right there at the end ? because you talked before about finding it difficult to know what to do when i match gets close ?
has it been tough making the transition ? you went from wimbledon to fed cup on clay and then hard courts ?
so are you feeling completely comfortable on the hard courts now ? you 've played about three tournaments ?
are you injured with the leg and everything ?
did it bother you during the match ?
your boyfriend , tomas berdych also lost in the first round in montreal , so i guess you could say it 's not a good trip for you in canada this year .
it 's going to be better next year ?
you 've been talking a lot recently about the inter-country rivalries like belgian henin and clistjers and now serbia and ivanovic and jankovic , do you look at other players like vaidisova , and are you aware of their progress ? do you use that as a benchmark ?
do you compare yourself to nicole at all and see how she 's doing ?
how about sort of other players your age ? who do you measure yourself against , if anyone ?
this ca n't be a satisfying way to get to the next round , is it ? just not the same as winning a match normally ?
is it satisfying to win a match when somebody has to retire ?
did you notice anything about her game or her personality that was not right today ?
so she called the trainer at 2-0 , that was the first time she called the trainer ? or was there a trainer she called after the first set ?
what happened out there ?
one of the other players told us she was tired and there may be too many tournaments . you just won in los angeles and flew right here . is that a possibility that you may have been tired ?
can you just discuss a little bit maybe the difference in pressure that one would feel coming back to try to defend a title ? you did n't get to defend it for very long , but the difference in attitude that you might have coming into that kind of tournament when you 're looking to protect your title ?
what did you know about her before the match ?
do you think you underestimated her ?
anna chakvetadze had to withdraw today . in a tournament that had already been hurt by withdrawals or no shows , how much does someone who is the defending champ going out , and chakvetadze might have been the hottest player on the tour this year , how much do you think that hurts the tournament ?
you know that novak lost today , too ?
how do you feel that both of you win on sunday and then ?
but you did n't know before you went out , i do n't think ?
so it was n't really sympathy ?
do you think that you would be ready for us open ?
how unusual is her game , because she hits quite flat and she has the two-handed strokes ?
i do n't know if you know this , but yan told us , in fact , you are her favorite player so it was a big thrill to play you and i guess beat you ?
were you happy with the way you played today ?
do you like where your game 's at knight right now in general ?
how 's the hamstring ? i know you pulled out , right , last week in l. a. ?
what parts of your game do you specifically want to improve on right now ?
can you talk about working with mats ? it 's been two matches now , couple of days ?
can you talk about what it 's been like working with mats this week ?
how has he been playing ?
do you normally use the on-court coaching ?
so is it -- does it create a difference in a match when you can call down someone like mats wilander who has won so many grand slams ? is that in itself a psychological edge , do you think because your opponent sees that ?
what are the main things you two plan to work on in your game ?
schiavone next . can you talk about that match a bit ?
how did you feel about your game today ? you got off to a great start , and what happened in the second and third sets ?
do you feel proud of what you 've accomplished here in toronto this year ?
could you hear the fans when they kept yelling go , steph , come on , stephanie in the crowd ? how did you feel about that ?
after the first set , i 'm just wondering if you saw a different player out of petrova ? if she really turned it on and if you were expecting that ?
can you tell me , how is the canadian tennis system helping you become a better player ?
what do you think young canadian players like yourself and aleksandra have to do to take the next step to become the next frank dancevic , to move up like him ?
so even though you did n't win today , does it help your confidence that you were able to win a set from a top 10 player ?
you talked about learning things this week . what are some of the things you feel you benefited the most ? what have you learned ?
just going into the match today , i 'm just wondering what your thoughts were , because going against petrova she 's not an easy player , obviously . i 'm wondering were you thinking a lot about the match last night , and what were your thoughts going in or expectations going in ?
when you won the first match in the tiebreaker , did you suddenly start to think , hey , i can win this competition today ?
did you feel bad right from the start of the match ?
this is the same kind of flu bug that you had from san diego ?
do you have any concern going into the us open ?
how about the fact that you wo n't be getting in , i guess , matches now going into the open . do you feel comfortable still ?
i 'm sorry . what are the symptoms you 're feeling , nausea , light-headed ?
so you lost to her last week and then you came out and had a really good first set , how important is that to you ?
pleased with your match today ?
oh , it was the knee ?
i was there at the end of the first set , and you came back nicely from 4-3 , you played pretty well . you must be pleased with that .
how much stronger is your game today than it was earlier in the year ? it seems that you 're building a bit of momentum right now ?
looks like three women , three canadian women are going to get through to the next round , how do you feel about being one of those ?
how much inspiration are you drawing from frank 's performance last week and also in indianapolis ? it 's a good time to be a canadian tennis player , i guess .
speaking of top players . you 're playing the 20th ranked player in the world tomorrow . what are you going to have to do to get by her tomorrow ?
must be a little bit disappointed you did n't put away one of those volleys in the match point ?
what would you say is your best quality ?
were you confident coming in with your form ?
a lot of unforced errors from both players today . was it just kind of a matter of who was going to make the least amount of mistakes was going to come around with the win ?
so what was your mindset after losing the lead at 3-0 , and then falling behind 5-3 ? what did you call on to make the comeback at the end ? what did you change ?
it seemed like she was making a ton of unforced errors on the backhand side , were you focusing primarily to try to push it on that side ?
what does it mean to get this result in canada in front of a crowd that was supporting you so much ?
you had the success last year in montreal , is that something you can build on even though it 's a different venue ?
do you have any friends here or family here watching you today ?
could you pick out their voices in the crowd when they were cheering or were you aware of them there ?
you said when you were little you watched this tournament a fair bit . what are some of your memories of it when you were a young kid , and who did you watch then that you really liked ?
is this the biggest win of your career , do you think ?
she 's 27 in the world , so , pretty good ?
i noticed you were challenging calls , and when you won them you were pumping your fist as if you just won a shot . is that you were just really pumped up in the match ?
you got more right today than you got wrong ?
sort of a slow start for you this season . i 'm just wondering are you feeling a little bit more confident as the season is progressing and your game now ?
was the mental part a little harder to kind of overcome ? because i noticed you 're really hard on yourself if you lose a point . you kind of shriek or smack yourself or scrape the racquet against the ground . is that something your coach wanted you to try to put the point behind and you just kind of focus ahead ?
what will you be doing to prepare for your mechanics next match ?
well done today . can you talk a little about the belief and self confidence that you take out as a result against such an experienced player ? because i think you 're playing petrova in the next round , so that 's another step-up itself . what does a result like that do to your own self belief as a young and aspiring professional ?
did your opponent today say anything after the match to you like congratulations or anything ?
first question is a very obvious one . after you were behind love-40 , you obviously raised the level of your game . what happened in the first four games , and what did you do to change the pace of the match ?
what about the expectations from the tournament , next round , playing garbin , probably ?
yeah , she 's playing the quarterfinals ?
congratulations also for leading israel for the first time in fed cup to , i believe , a ranking of 8. and if i 'm correct , i believe for you it is a personal best . you 've gone undefeated play for now two years . in canada , as you know , you beat the home country here . last year montreal you were a quarterfinalist .
the other thing i wanted to know , you 're now in your third year , if i 'm correct , as a full-time pro . last year when you were in montreal , you had your career high at 15 .
no ? okay , forgive me about that . but at the time , it was your best result for a tier 1 until you finished as a semifinalist in miami in march .
little bit about history . i know a lot of people have asked you about this , so many years ago hadad played with qureshi , they won the humanitarian award because an israeli played with a muslim . now that you 're playing most of the time , not this week , but with mirza . i wondered if a lot of people asked you about it , if in israel there is big news about that ?
will you be playing us open doubles with sania mirza ?
tell us again how you do that thing where you come back and you look like you 're out of it ?
why do you think you 're able to stay aggressive on these big points where other players just tighten up or just ca n't produce the shot ? what do you think it is about you that enables you to make those fearless plays when it matters ?
where were you for venus 's 2001 final here ?
jennifer capriatti ?
what sort of emotions did you have watching venus that day ?
did you ever have talk with venus about her mentality at matchpoint , sometime after the match ?
what did she impart to you when you had this conversation ?
what makes justine such a tough opponent ?
is she a cut above the other women that you 've been beating up on as a competitor ?
after losing the first set , why did n't you call out your coach ?
dwyane wade was here , and i think someone asked him about the comeback , and he said it was fabulous ; great athletes do great things .
any explanation for the first set performance ?
was your knee bothering you at all ?
when did that second gear like kick in for you in the match ?
did you get frustrated at all ? like when i 'm sure she was hurt , but she would take a little pause and you were in your rhythm , did you get frustrated at all ? it seemed like one time you were .
you had some very long points deep into that third set . it seemed from the stands as if you might be tiring a little bit . were you ?
sometimes people dig down a little deep and find something .
where does this rank among satisfying comebacks in an important match for you ?
you now possess the two biggest tournaments of the year so far , the australian open and the sony ericsson open . where do you think you can go from there ? what can you build on this ?
you go to charleston ?
and then back to delray ?
will it be difficult going hard court to clay court ?
when you go through a match like this and you go through the emotional roller coaster that you did , the fans and the whole thing , does that increase your appetite to play ? i mean , do you think , all right , this is great stuff , it 's great to be here again , or is it been there , done that ?
you said you played better when you get down , or could some of that be once you get down , then you just start playing by reflex or instinct ? maybe you 're not thinking , you 're just doing , i do n't know . is there something to be said for playing just naturally without thinking ?
is that what you did at 3-3 those three straight games in the third ?
justine is known for mental toughness . you 're down 6-0 , you come back to win , you obviously showed that you have just as high a level of mental toughness . can you define for me , what is mental toughness in your opinion ?
at what point in this match did you feel like you caught the serena flame ?
you 're a great athlete , and an even greater professional . it got really tough for you out there , two tumbles that you took . how are you feeling physically ?
you sat on the ground for a few minutes . what were you thinking when this was happening ?
after the first fall , when you skinned your knee ?
do you feel it inhibited your game in any way ?
has this been something of a problem in the past , where you get off to a fast start , and then you seem to relax a little bit and get a little too cautious ?
you have n't played her in a long time , and can you just comment on her level ? is it different playing her than all the other girls on the tour because of her fighting spirit and her game ?
it was great to see that neither of you used on-court coaching . that was the best part of the match for me .
it looked like you had some pleasant conversation both at the net and on the awards podium afterwards . is there more of an ease to your relationship now than there was years ago ?
would you be willing to tell us what she said ?
when you lost that second set , obviously you must have been extremely disappointed , then you lost three games in a row . were you still struggling mentally ? what happened there , because it seems that things seemed to run away from you a little bit ?
this is a very emotional month for you , we all know that . but your success here in the last 11 days , do you think it will change the way you feel about this tournament in general ?
the ball that serena hits , we 're not on the court , how would you compare it ? is it heavier , harder than other top players , sharapova , others ?
if i could just follow up on the on-court coaching comment , you personally do n't like it ; you feel you have the maturity to handle this . is it a bad message for the women 's game to have it in general ? in other words , does it seem to make other women players look weak if they need help between sets ?
on the two matchpoints as you think back on them , do you feel that serena forced the play and seized those points or did you in some way make errors of judgment on them ?
at the end of the first set , you won obviously 6-0. did you ever think okay , she 's burnt out , because she played back-to-back ? or played other great players back-to-back ?
you look at the results , look at the australian open and stuff . does the women 's game need you and serena to be playing matches ?
you 'll take some time off now to refresh . how , typically how long does it take you to make the transition from hard court to clay in charleston and feel really comfortable on the court ?
serena , how is your knee ? are you okay ? are you all right ?
what is your game plan as far as how you 're going to get past justine ?
it was like a war out there tonight , was n't it , serena ? that first set , so intense . you just gutted it out , you were n't playing your best ?
your dad was writing notes for most of the first sets , and he only had two minutes to deliver his sermon . what did he say to you ?
were you nervous ?
serena that 2003 french open seemed to engender some bad feelings with justine . but when did that coolness thaw ? or what changed ?
but you also want it to be fair , right ?
well , you want the competition fair ?
justine did mention that it was good to see you making such a strong comeback as you are . she also mentioned that she does n't like on-court coaching , she does n't need it . she 's been coached for 11 years and all she has to do is look at him , and with a body language or gesture , she knows what to do . will you as a result -- how will that affect what you use for on-court coaching saturday ?
right . okay , the bottom line is will you call her out to the court ?
serena , shahar seems to have given you a better match than any other opponent . is there anything about her particular game that is struggling ? i also wanted to comment that she 's a good omen for you . every opponent she lost to in the last two months has gone on to win the championship .
you beat sharapova and vaidisova in australia . all three of them got another shot . how much pride do you take in solidifying their wins here ?
are you surprised that like in australia , that you saw so many israeli flags , that shahar seems to have so many supporters , like you have your supporters , wherever she goes around the world ?
have you ever had a chance to visit israel ? i know you 're jehovah 's witness . from what i 've been reading about it , there 's a lot of significance about going to israel and visiting . i know you mentioned you feel a spiritual thing for people in africa . would you ever feel spiritual when you go to israel ?
serena , it seems on the big points especially , it 's so important to keep emotions out of it . or if a point goes poorly , to be able to move on . was that hard for you ? is that ever still hard for you ? how did you -- you seem to be an ebullient player , but how do you keep your emotions under control ?
can you compare your level , like in this match , versus the end of last year ?
start to finish , was this your best match in this tournament so far ?
justine , what kind of game does n't she like so much ? can you explain a little bit ?
she complimented the fact that you did change up the game .
justine , can you explain , you do understand how you 've been able to get over the malaise that you felt ?
do you feel as mentally strong as you were ?
justine , what are your thoughts about the on-court coaching ? you have very close relations with your coach . have you and carlos talked about that ?
you do n't care if the other players on the tour does it , that 's okay ?
were you ever at the point where you were on the verge of giving up on trying to do well here , just thinking this is not a good match , this is not going to happen , or did you see it as a different kind of challenge ?
what was the diagnosis for the breathing problems you were having earlier ?
is it better now ?
one of your possible opponents is obviously serena . you have n't played her in almost four years .
it 's quite a long time . can you just comment on that gap ?
the medications combined with the sun , how does that feel ? i heard you say something about taking medication ?
the medication that you 're taking combined with the sun ?
so the sun does n't bother you , it has no side effects ?
how do you block out all the stuff going on in your personal life right now ?
what do you think that you 've done well that 's helped you against serena in the past ?
what you did well when you beat serena ?
what was your strategy going into the match ?
why did n't you play that well today ?
it 's strange , because you are coming into top 10 and you turned around ?
you 're not giving yourself much credit ?
you always tell the truth ?
can you explain how you improved so much in one year ?
you have no coach ?
why ? do n't you want to have a coach ?
did he teach something special to you ?
did you feel flat from the very beginning of the match ? like could you see that i 'm just not feeling like i 'm going to have my rhythm today ?
did you feel that in the warm-up before the match ?
what do you expect for the next tournament ?
in russia ?
just a word about justine . she seems to be much less powerful than a lot of other players , and she 's no.1 . what has she got that the others maybe do n't have ?
do you think you can come in the top 5 this year ?
congratulations . how happy are you , and can you talk about your match ?
you 've kept improving all along . what have you done to improve your game in this season ?
so you 've been out in palm springs though ?
jose was such a great clay court player .
you meet the winner of serena and vaidisova . can you talk about each of them and how would you like to meet serena again ?
what has life been like for you since the australian open in israel ?
yes , what 's it been like ?
what do you mean ? can you be more specific ?
americans like to have autographs . do israelis like to have autographs , too ?
so if you go to a nightclub or a club in israel ?
they wo n't ask ?
no proposals of marriage ?
prime minister ohmert , when was the last time you talked to him and how often do you talk , and when was the first time he ever contacted you ?
wherever you go , i know when you were in miami , the israeli consulate had a reception for you . is that often the case , especially when you are in new york or los angeles and there are large jewish populations , that you get honored by the community ?
how about in miami ? what 's it like here for you ? there 's a pretty big jewish population . have you found people have been supporting you ? i saw some israeli flags .
were they yelling anything in hebrew or singing anything ?
the fans . i do n't know , i heard people .
where are your grandparents from ?
very multi-national ?
were they concentration camp survivors , your grandparents ?
i thought i read that .
next week , how do you celebrate passover ?
with this tournament , i think you go over the $ 1 million mark . is that kind of nice ? do you think of money at all for your career ?
i wanted to ask you also about the dubai tournament . i know that 's one of the tournaments i guess in this new format that you have to play in , or supposedly . is that something that you would go to or that you would skip ?
after what happened in australia , did you really think you could come back with another emphatic victory against maria today ?
did you expect it to be quite that easy ?
is it simply that you just figured her game out ?
when you hold your index finger up in the air , does that mean you 're no.1 , if not in the ranking but in practice right now ?
the de facto no.1 ?
you were also saying something , i 'm not a great lip reader so i was going to ask you what you were saying .
is this possibly the next great rivalry do you think between you and sharapova ?
suspensions , just to veer off , we wanted to get your thoughts on suspensions . we were listening to larry scott earlier , and he spoke about suspensions for , i guess , pulling out of tournaments . the question was asked : does it apply to players who are age 30 or approaching age 30 or in cases like with --
not that you 're approaching 30 , but younger players like yourself as well as older players as well as players with special circumstances , such as amlie .
can you describe - because obviously i 've never been in your position - what does it feel like to be on the court and be dominating a match the way that you 've done the last few times with maria ? can you articulate what that feels like ?
how much was this match a statement , or how much satisfaction do you take out of this match that australia was n't just a one-off when you came out here and beat her worse than australia ?
did your father have anything useful to say ?
are you feeling under appreciated when you say that many doubters ?
why do you think there are so many doubters ? what do you think people think of you ?
you said in australia you needed a mental break . can you expound on that a little , how you needed a break ?
was there any emotional hangover of any kind for you because of that incident yesterday ? did you spend time thinking about it last night , or was it over once you left the grounds ?
how much fitter are you now than australia ? you looked great out there .
did you find maria 's double faulting a little bit distracting today , or did you just think to stay focused ?
can you describe to a non-bling expert what those earrings are , what they 're made of , and if they 're heavy ?
do you think you could be the federer of the women 's tour , or do you feel that you are ?
what would you have to do to do that ? what 's the difference between where you are now and what you 'd have to do to do that ?
what is all the wrist tape for ? i have n't seen you this taped off .
but seriously .
is there anything wrong with your wrists ?
do you worry about -- this was obviously an emotional match . you talked yesterday about the intensity of when you play maria . do you worry at all about a letdown for the next round ? how do you keep yourself motivated ?
i understand florida is being considered your home court because you guys live here , and scanning the seats i saw a huge group of supporters who were spelling out your name . would that happen to be extended family , especially since you 're home ?
are you disappointed that in the fed cup you and venus could have been playing clijsters and henin but they pulled out , and it looks on the surface it 's going to be fairly one-sided . do you have any thoughts about henin and clijsters and should they have competed for belgium ?
you went to africa last year , i believe . kerry washington , she was filming `` the last king of scotland . '' talked about landing in africa and being sort of nervous , like she felt if she did n't feel anything , what would that say about her . and i was wondering if you could relate to that and how that experience did change you maybe ?
is that the closest you 've come to how you feel on the tennis court when everything is going beautifully ? is there any kind of --
get back to us .
you had a layover in nigeria . where did you go from there ?
accra ?
so much is happening , speaking of africa . major league baseball is doing stuff over there , oprah opened a school . any ideas for doing anything in africa , or you have n't gotten to that point yet ?
any date or when it might be ready ?
would that be a joint project with venus ?
you 're going to do it --
after what happened yesterday did you have any thoughts today when you went on the court about something like what happened to monica seles or anything like that ? did you have any of those fears after what happened yesterday ?
is the heart necklace special in any way ?
you 've taken maria just out of the match from the get-go the last few times you 've played her , and i 've seen you struggle with other players along the way . so is it something that you get an extra motivation going into that match ? it 's a good matchup for you ?
where is the famous sharapova serve gone to ?
your second is coming in not at the same speed as it usually does . are you being a little too careful with it ?
did it feel a little bit like melbourne ?
how do you break out of this situation ?
do you think it 's a technical problem or when that ball gets up are you just thinking -- not that confident ?
serena was saying yesterday one of the reasons when you play each other it 's intense is you 're kind of similar in personality . that you 're perfectionists to a tee , that you both hate to lose so much . do you see that ? do you think that you both are similar in a way and that 's why your matches are the way they are emotionally ?
there are n't a lot of players where you 're not controlling most of the points . is she hitting with that much more power , or is she stepping in and taking the ball that much earlier than a lot of players ? what 's your explanation for that ?
wta has a rule now that you can call the coach in after the set . if i 'm correct i do n't believe you called your father for any consultation . do you think at the end of the first set you could have used his coaching advice ?
today it 's probably not , but is it good for the game to have serena back ?
does it sort of raise the bar for everybody else do you think when she plays ?
what do you need to do to regain your no.1 status ? and what do you think about suspensions , because that 's been a whole other conversation larry scott has been talking about .
do you think suspension is too harsh for a player that does n't have a legitimate reason to miss a tournament ?
what would be your solution ?
are you surprised that she can come out so match tough when she plays so few tournaments ? i mean , she has n't played competitively in six weeks .
her serve , i mean , her overall first and second serve , is it considered the best in the game ?
just a little off beat question . from the time you started tennis to now , what was your best day in tennis ?
just because it was the first one ?
your opinion about on-court coaching ?
just talk about your level . how did you feel like the match went ?
is it harder with the wind here ? a lot of people have been complaining or just saying that it 's very difficult , even your sister yesterday .
she 's a tricky player , too .
you were talking to the chair umpire about somebody in the stands late in the match . do you know who that is ?
was it vulgar ?
did they kick him out ?
was he doing it like during the point ?
when did you finally complain ? what game was it ?
was there anything racist ?
let 's roundup a posse .
can i ask about the next match ?
maria was in here last night or yesterday afternoon , and she said , you know , the last time i played serena she played great and i was n't there . do you expect her to show up more this time ?
are you looking forward to proving that was n't just a one-time domination ?
what is it about when you guys play each other , though ? it 's really intense . when we 're watching on tv in the u.s. and you were in australia , for both of you it just seemed like a very intense , personal match . what is it about your rivalry with her that makes it that much tension ?
can you feel that big sort of personality sort of clashing when you come on the court against her ?
did you get the feeling in australia -- i mean , it seemed from almost the beginning of the match that you were in complete control of that match . that 's how it appeared from the outside . is that how it felt to you on the inside from the beginning ?
roger maybe ?
is there a little extra motivation because she knocked off venus in a tough match ?
do you feel like the winner of this match has a good chance of winning the tournament ?
we noticed that on the sign-up sheets for coaches that venus was down as your official coach .
who would come on the court if you needed a coach on the court ?
we were kind of looking forward to seeing what advice she would give .
do you wish you were playing maria later ? it seems like you guys playing each other this early --
in australia the key was you served great and you really came out and you were aggressive . is that really how you 're going to have to approach this match again ?
can you explain why you switched to that new racquet , the k factor ?
strategically being aggressive is going to be the key ?
talk about the match , how you felt your level was .
is this the first tournament really where you 've been back where there 's a lot of media , all the players are here ? you obviously played in the middle east , but is that -- i mean , it 's been a few months since you 've been in this environment again . is that something that 's sort of welcome , or is it sort of like , oh , i 'm back in this crazy environment ?
did you watch the australian open when it was going on ?
but were you checking the results ?
when you saw serena advancing round after round , were you as surprised as maybe some of us were that were there just to see , after not winning a title at any level for two years , that she could --
when you look back at 2004 , do you look -- and the three russians that won -- was it a little bit of a period that was possible ? because even kim or her and the williams sisters were playing , at that point except for maybe maria , it looks like maybe they were able to win because a lot of players were out .
you 've had such great results here in the u.s. when you retire , what will be some of your fondest memories , and how hard is it going to be to say goodbye to the fans here ?
how much time do you plan on spending here since your fianc is american ?
how hard do you think it 's going to be to say goodbye when you retire ?
do you think you 're going to cry ? will it be a tear-jerking moment ?
does she have top 10 potential , do you think ?
but you are n't saying yes or no , you 're on the fence ?
you 've always been a player that 's thrived on a lot of matches . with the kind of scheduling that i 've read about , can you play your best tennis when you 're not playing a lot of matches ?
what in particular are you referring to ?
what part of your body is not capable of playing --
if you feel like you 're not getting enough matches will you consider playing a few more tournaments ?
what would you say your physical level is now in terms of feeling healthy , 90 percent or 100 percent ?
what 's your schedule for the next few weeks ?
you 're not scheduled for any events ?
so warsaw and then france ?
how do you feel about the match ? what do you think happened there ?
there were a lot of errors on both sides , and double faults . was that more the conditions or the tension of the match ? what do you think ?
venus , it 's 5-5 in the third set , and you start your service game off with two service winners . it looks like you 're in control of this game now . it 's never materialized . you had four game points in there and you could n't put any of them away .
is there any one of those points that you did n't convert that you really regret ?
do you feel like you played the wrong shot on any of those four points ?
do you think that she won the game or that you lost the game because of the unforced errors ?
is it more frustrating to lose this way than if you feel like you played well and you lost , but to feel like you kind of gave it away a little bit , does it hurt more ?
venus , she 's been struggling a little bit since the australian open final . you guys have n't played in a while . how does her game compare to a couple of years ago ?
any evolution in it , or is it the same game you saw at wimbledon two years ago ?
venus , did this feel like a third-round match or a semifinal or a final to you ?
are you planning an aggressive clay court season ?
before the french ?
charleston ?
rome ?
so where does beating martina here on center court , where does that rank in your career ? is that your biggest win , would you say or no ?
you made it to wimbledon ?
oh , yeah ?
what did you like about her ? why was she your favorite player ?
where do you train actually ?
where do you train ?
are there a lot of tennis players in poland ?
domascowska , is she still playing ?
so do you have a fed cup team ?
yeah , that should be a pretty good team .
what 's her name ?
but younger , one year behind you ? she 's one year younger than you ?
so could you forget that it was martina across the net ? did you have to pretend she was not your childhood hero ?
was your father here ?
so he was the one who came to the bench ?
was he a player , too ? what 's his background ?
when he came to the bench , did he give you an important piece of information ?
when he came to the bench as a coach and he talked to you , did he tell you something important ?
so it was a motivational comment from him ?
it says in the book , i think , that you 're still in high school . are you still in school ?
studying ?
can you be done for the french ? finished with your exams ?
so you have your books here with you ?
do you have a favorite grand slam ?
you also said you have a pet mouse ?
is this true , a mouse ? an actual mouse ?
two rats ?
what are their names ?
flippy and floppy ?
why would you call two rats flippy and floppy ?
so when you call them , do they come to you ?
how big ?
wow , and you like rats ?
did you catch them or buy them ?
some people we think of rats as dirty , and like garbage .
like a kitten ?
they 're back home in poland ? they do n't come with you , right ?
do they do any tricks ?
you feed them cheese , of course ?
but do they like a particular kind of cheese ?
they 're rats ?
they eat anything . you do n't have a cat or a snake ?
where do you live in poland ?
what a beautiful city .
have you ever met wojtek fibak ?
when ?
was it exciting for you to meet him ?
what , the greatest polish player ever ?
who do you play next ?
have you played either of them ? do you have a preference , either one ?
did you play junior , like orange bowl or anything here in miami ?
how did you do ?
well , what 's next ?
when you say think some things over , can you expand a little bit more ?
could it be that when you came on last year , you were full of so much excitement to play , that maybe you 've , this is an accumulation dating back even to last year ?
will two weeks be enough before charleston to make you feel comfortable ?
this is the second week of this tournament .
you stay in tampa or go back to europe ?
radek won almost at the same time that you lost . what happens between the two of you , when someone loses and one wins on the same day like this ?
how often do you hit together ?
he has a very unusual style .
why did n't he play davis cup ?
-- touchy subject ?
you reached the $ 20 million milestone here . you 're only the fourth woman to do that . is that significant ?
is that a significant achievement ?
you 've come back and fought your way back into the top 10. but there are so many good players out there now to play a young former junior star like this , and to know that a year from now she 's going to be that much better . how difficult is it for you to stay in the top 10 when you have so much young talent coming up ?
two calls for the coach after the second and third set -- second set , i guess . did it help any or hurt ?
when you came back , everything was sort of on the up side for you on the points and just moving up the rankings . sort of the first difficult match you 've hit maybe . i do n't know if you feel like you 've plateaued a little bit . but having been away from the game and coming back , is it easier to absorb these periods , or does it feel like the first time ?
so at this sort of surface speed , you 're playing too defensive and not aggressive enough ?
and you have n't figured that out yet ?
talk about the match a little bit . what happened
was there any sort of a let down coming into this tournament after your great result last week ?
going back to last week , have you had some time to absorb that ?
what were your feelings ? was it a feeling of elation , of relief ?
but if you 're only going to win a few tournaments , i guess you picked the good ones to win .
the last few years you came up , you were highly touted , you rose up fast , you sort of plateaued , you fell a little bit . what have you learned about yourself through all these ups and downs ?
can you be easier on yourself , after a loss like today ?
what do you still like about being a professional tennis player ?
did you put so much pressure on yourself when you were younger and coming up ?
media , sponsors ?
management , people like that ?
i think you 've said in the past that could contend as a top 20 player . but does a result like last week sort of make you feel like -- and maybe that 's wrong . i think i read that you said that , but does a result like that make you sort of reassess where you think you 'd like to be or what your goals are ?
do you think you 're as good a thinker as martina hingis ?
where are you living and training most of the time now ?
tough first set . what are your thoughts ? was it a little rust ? was vania playing well ?
did you say this was not your favorite event ?
is that a cold ?
could you talk about vania 's game ? obviously the americans , beyond the williams girls , the american tennis right now is suffering a little bit . she 's one of the young up and coming ones . do you think she has what it takes ? what does she need to get to the next level ?
she says you 're one of her role models , maybe because of the size similarity . what do you say about that ?
you give her hope for the vertically challenged .
and that 's advice for her , as well , right ?
does it feel different that you just returned to the no.1 position last week ? and does it give you more confidence when you play and go out on the court ?
why do you think you do n't fare so well here ? is it the windy conditions ?
do you mean every march is tough for you or just this march ?
could you just talk about what the motivating factor ? you looked really motivated second and third set .
after the second set you were so dominating there . were you surprised that you kept that going and in the third set you kind of steamrolled a little bit ?
how did the breaks affect your tournament today or your game ?
do you think that the length of your match because of all the breaks is going to affect your next match ?
how did the weather affect you today , or the wind ?
last year you defeated the 2nd seed and the 27th seed and made it to the fourth round . what are your expectations this year ?
what kind of adjustments did you make ? you called your coach over going into the third set and then the break . what kind of adjustments did you make ? because clearly with the breaks and everything you really stepped up your game in the third set .
do you feel going into your next match , considering you won your third set in such a dominating fashion , that you can kind of take something from that different than if you would have played going into a tiebreak into the third set since you were able to clear out the third set pretty quickly ?
during the rain delays what do you do to pass time , what kind of things ?
what kind of activities do you plan on engaging in while you 're not on the tennis court here in miami ? you have some familiarity with florida . now that you 're in miami , what do you plan on doing ? and when you see this tournament on your calendar , do you perceive it a little bit differently , go into it a little bit differently ?
do you have a favorite place to play ?
what do you think of the purple courts ? that 's been kind of a talking point around the courts here this week . what do you think of them ?
is there anything different from a player 's perspective when the courts are like that ?
are you okay ? what happened there in the second set where you had to have the trainer out ?
did they give you something for it ?
were you feeling that way at the beginning of the match ? you took a quick bathroom break before the match actually started . were you already feeling a little sick ?
probably just the heat today ?
is it like a stomach virus ?
on the court how did it affect you ? seemed you were tired .
i know you have not played justine for three and a half years . you said you 'd been following her . is this the best level you 've seen her play ?
is it unfortunate the two best players had to meet in the semifinals instead of the final here ?
when you broke her back at 3-5 , did you think you might be able to turn it around at that point ?
your volleying today . considering the quality of your opponent , when have you volleyed this well ?
what is your goal in tennis now ?
were you feeling like this at all in the last match ?
have you ever felt this way ? do you remember ever feeling this way before ?
yeah ?
so is it sort of a recurring thing this summer ?
this illness , do you think it 's something you need a full workup on or is it just an isolated thing ?
did serena tell you how to play after her quarterfinals ?
do you think you 're going to have to stop and see a doctor , really sort of figure this out ?
have you spoken to serena since the match ended ?
your father said she had gone back .
why did n't she want to stick around ?
does it make it any harder to take the disappointment of not winning this , considering she also beat serena ?
when you left the court before the match began , was that because of the illness ?
what does the experience of winning wimbledon and then going as far as you have done here when you 're not feeling a hundred percent tell you about yourself that maybe you did n't know before ?
you still have a chance to get to the madrid championships . might have to play a fairly aggressive schedule . are you prepared to do that ?
which tournaments ?
the trainer took your pulse and temperature . do you have a temperature ?
can you tell me what the big difference was between you and justine ?
does henin play you the same way , meaning you and serena ?
what made the difference between the first and second and third sets ?
why do you think you were nervous ?
do you think now because you 're not going to be the favorite in the final will you feel less pressure ?
how much better do you have to play tomorrow to win , regardless of who wins today ?
do you root not to have to play the no.1 player in the world ?
what kind of challenge will it be if it 's venus , knowing she 'll have the crowd on her side ?
when you 're struggling like that early and there 's nerves , do you move your feet more ? do you try to hit more spin ? give yourself margin ? how do you snap out of it ?
is it more difficult to get into a rhythm against her ?
were you surprised she did n't come out more nervous ?
were you expecting a tougher fight in the third set ?
do you think your game matches up with one of those guys better than the other ? do you feel more comfortable against justine or venus ?
you said your win in 2004 seemed very far away . is it all coming back to you now ?
will you watch this match ?
how confident are you to win tomorrow ?
do you have your hat picked out for your next press conference ?
is being no.1 a goal you 've had for a long time , or is it more of a target that you 're getting close ?
does being no.2 sharpen your desire ?
what is it about the us open that brings out the best in you ?
is it important to give the crowd a smile so they get on your side ?
three major crises for you in this match , and you rallied back from each . can you talk about how mentally you recovered ?
a lot has changed since the last time you played her four and a half years ago . how important here is it to finally get through against her after losing seven in a row ?
for a long time , were you one of those people ?
was there any moment when you were worried that the match may be turning away from you ?
you scored a lot of points in this match by reading what she was going to do , being in the right place . can you talk to us about that ability .
she called a trainer . later we found out it was because of dizziness . she also said afterwards that she was not a hundred percent .
are you a little disappointed that she 's talking about her health ?
did she feel any different when you were feeling her on the court ?
is anybody after eight months on this tour this year a hundred percent ? is n't everybody sort of aching someplace after all this tennis ?
you said before you used of to fear her game and serena 's game . what sense do you have of their feeling for your game when they 're on the court against you ?
do you see anything in the way they play you now that 's different from in the past ?
is this one thing you can point to in your training that has produced the amazing power that you have , despite your small frame ?
we can see you really want to win . what 's the biggest motivation to win this tournament ?
i think after the first set , or sometime in the second set , you opened some envelope . was it an inspirational message from someone ?
you had two very emotional matches in a row . now you do n't get a day off . how difficult will it be to come back tomorrow ?
your scouting report on svetlana . you 've beaten her 14 times .
the way you began this year , would you have been surprised to know you would win one slam and put yourself in position to win another ?
you expressed a little concern about the recovery tomorrow night . could anything be ever as tough as coming back from that capriati match , having to play the next night ?
where do you think the match got away from you ?
can you point to any reason why that did n't happen ?
when you took that ten-minute break between the second and third set , where you able to regroup a little bit ?
other than the result , what was the difference in the way you two played the first set compared to here and new haven ?
obviously not the result you would want to do , but are you pleased with your performance as far as you were able to get this week , or last week and into this week ?
describe the way she 's playing right now . is she in your estimation playing top-tier tennis ? i mean , is she going to be very hard to beat ?
when you say you played the wrong tactic , what tactic would you say you tried that did n't work exactly ?
it 's been a very good year for you . this match in a way probably tells you , what more do i need to do now to get up one more level . what do you think ?
what did you feel after 4-2 , when you lead 4-2 ?
what makes her so tough ?
what makes her a good player ? is it her ability to move the ball around the court ? she does n't seem overpowering .
how are you feeling physically right now ?
no one questions your quickness around the court or your fighting spirit . those are the two most the important things in your game . but are the groundstrokes top 10 quality right now ?
when you go home , you 're leaving back to go to israel from here , will you take time off ? will you have to serve back in the army immediately ? do you get a little bit of rest from this ?
will you go home tomorrow and then be back ?
do you have to the full two years like women in israel ?
of course it 'll take you much longer than two years .
so they count this time ?
are you still a corporal ?
two stripes ?
one stripe ? no stripes ?
so when you get back will you get a stripe ?
could you be a general someday ?
when you get home and you have time to really think about this , can you look back and say , wow , i had a tremendous run here ?
israel is a small country with a lot of media . when you go home you 're somewhat of a very , very well-know figure now , how much demand will there be on your time from magazines and tv and radio ?
do you wear a uniform when you report back ?
and do you have fall-in or anything like that ? do you answer roll call in the morning ?
and you have a weapon that you --
but you would get a weapon one day ?
you 're more clerical , is that it ? like a secretary ?
do you enjoy the balance of the life as a tour player and then back home in and the ability to serve your country in the military ?
are you a better person for serving in the military ?
have you calculated what you would have to do to get to madrid , to the championship ?
it 's going to be very difficult ?
do you live in a barracks or can you live on your own ?
was there any part of basic training that you enjoyed ?
there are a great number of jewish people in this city . have you had some experiences here in the last eight , nine days of people coming up to you and saying maybe , i knew your parents when or some odd thing like that ?
you have now equaled amos mansdorf 's high ranking . how well do you know him ? has he done anything for you ?
are you pleased with the match today , the way you played ?
you said early in the week you do n't like to look ahead . you like to go one match at a time . you 've managed to get through in straight sets of last several matches . do you feel collectively that the relative ease of those matches has left to you physically very strong going into the semifinals ?
do you feel mentally and physically stronger at this stage of a tournament than you ever have before at this particular stage ?
what did you expect out of anna in the next round ?
before the tournament , a lot of people said that sharapova had an easy run to the final . you 've won the us open and you 're the fourth seed here . do you feel that people have overlooked you ?
what was your reaction when they moved venus ' match to tonight ? did that impact your schedule as a result of that ?
does n't have any extra appeal to play under the lights ?
you like is it tournament in particular , right ?
you like playing in new york ?
do you come and spend time in new york outside of tennis ? have you ever come just as a tourist ?
you might not want to entertain this question , but when you look at the players on the other half of the draw , is there any benefit to you , be it mentally or physically , that they take so much out of each other in getting to the final ? if you got to the finals that might be a set up for a let down ?
we asked your opponent , peer , what 's so good about you . she said , oh , you 'd have to ask anna , but she could n't figure it out . all you do is you win matches . how are you doing it ?
yes . how are you doing it ? you 're not serve and volleying and you 're not explosive , but you keep winning you 're and no.5 in the world .
excuse me . you 'll be 5 .
you seem to know though where the ball is . you anticipate well i would say , because you 're there . when the ball is there you 're there .
you were talking going into the match that shahar had given you a very tough match in march . what did you do to change it around ? did you change your tactics ?
how do you learn to play this way ? it 's almost like martina hingis-type tennis .
had you watched lost the martina hingis when you were a junior ?
you 've had two matches with svetlana kuznetsova . is there a common theme in both of those matches ? did the matches progress in the same way ?
is that the way you felt all season , that you have no pressure ?
can you talk about that a bit , because you 've made such a great rise . there must be more expectations ?
you also always seem to be in a good mood .
but is there anything this really gets you down ? you seem so bubbly and happy .
you were saying no pressure on yourself depending on how the players you play are , but you 're also the type of player if you do n't play well you get upset with yourself . you have high expectations of your own level , correct ?
why did you think the crowd -- or feel -- that the crowd was against you ?
how old were you when you decide that you needed to stop hitting the ball so flat and change tactics a little bit ?
it a was coach that sat down and talked to you about that ?
how long did it take to you get comfortable with this new style ?
you 're going into your first grand slam semifinal . what does that mean to you ? this is as if far as you 've got in a slam before .
to go out and play under the circumstances you did today with the crowd so in favor of her and you 're twenty years of age , to be able to go out in that environment and to play the way that you did and prevail , how do you feel about that in terms of your own development as a player mentally ?
your probably answered the question , but why do you think the girls from eastern europe are so successful ?
are you upset that there are so many players in this tournament in the quarterfinal ? there are six players in the fourth round from eastern europe . are you upset about this fact ?
here 's something else you probably never thought about . everybody said there 's nobody good in the bottom . nobody any good down there after sharapova lost . what do you think of that , to be among the bottom feeders ?
do you think since wimbledon you maybe have been playing the best tennis on hard courts all summer long , and if you play to your level you should get to the final ?
do you think that you will feel no pressure as well on friday and maybe even saturday ?
if there were just a few russian girls doing well it might be easier for everyone to be close and social . but there are so many good russian women on the tour right now . does that maybe make in more difficult to get close to people from your own country because you 're competing against them all the time ?
is lansdorp coming now ?
how much has he been helping you ?
did you visit him or ...
are you surprised at your own success here ? you have n't lost a single set .
this is only your third grand slam . you 're in the quarterfinals . can you point to anything that you 're doing right now that it 's all coming together for you ?
how long did n't you play ?
when you retired in new haven with your back injury , did you even think you 'd be able to play ?
how long did it take before you knew you had a chance to play ?
how is it now ?
did you have special treatment ?
what makes you interested in tennis ? we do n't think of hungary for tennis .
who did you look up to when you were growing up ? was it somebody like andrea temesvari or somebody more famous ?
do you look at this half of the draw as a great opportunity when you look at the way things have worked , the top seed not there ?
4 .
can you explain some of the reasons why you 've been so successful these couple of weeks ? something you 're doing different in your game before ?
did he say something specific to do on the court this summer ?
when you won the challenger in houston last fall , at the time you said you were feeling well . got you headed where you are today .
you were fully well at that point .

what happened ?
have you been doing anything fun in new york ?
anything you look forward to doing ?

what 's the hardest thing for you about living out of a suitcase ?
when exactly did you have the diagnosis of mononucleosis and when did you start to recover ?
what about playing svetlana ? you played her for a set and a half . what do you think about it this time ?
your doubles partner an even fans in the stands were saying they have n't seen you play this crisply maybe ever . how do you respond to that ? do you agree you 're playing your best tennis right now ?
is that maybe what you learned from the australia experience , that it really does n't matter ? as long as you advance in the first week , you really want to peak the second week , but do n't get worried if it 's not perfect in week one ?
do you think you get greater fan support here in new york ?
do you have any direct connection , relatives here ?
you stay with a family here ?
a family you got to know when you were a junior ?
where are they located ?
long island ?
do you have any sense from anyone back home what kind of big deal it is ? are people following ?
why do you say it 's too much ? is it too many people interviewing you ?
is your family here ?
are you still in the army or have you fulfilled your commitment ?
will you go back here to israel ?

do you have to answer phones ?
you practice in the afternoon ?
how long did it take you to complete ?
do people treat you special when you 're there because of your athletic accomplishments ?
not to look ahead too far , but if you wind up playing anna , you 've had tough matches this summer . what have you learned from those matches ?
anna chakvetadze ?
do you think playing the doubles took too much strength from you not to concentrate on the singles ?
when you have to play more games ...
does it somehow help you in the singles ?

when you 're in new york , do you often hear hebrew being shouted on the court ?
what are they shouting ?
were you aware that alex rodriguez , the yankees player , watched your match the other day ? what is it like to know that a superstar was watching ?
you do n't hold it against him that he left early ?
how long were you paired with sania mirza as a doubles partner ? did you decide not to play together for tennis reasons ?
you are still going to be a doubles partner with sania ?
are you a product of an israeli tennis program or are you an individual who grew up playing tennis in israel and gained experience elsewhere ?
i do n't think a lot of people made you the favorite coming in . what did you feel coming in , what do you feel now about your chances ?
you played the long second game of the second set . after that you really put together a strong streak . did you feel like she got fatigued or did you pick it up after that game ?
the other day marat talked about being a former champion here . he said , what happens in the past , who cares . do you feel like that or when you walk into this tournament you still have a sense of it 's your house , too ?
all these young girls in this part of the draw , do you remember three years ago when you were one of these young girls ?
what do you make of all these girls in the draw that are 18 , 19 ? is this an announcement from them they 're ready to go deep in majors ?
can you talk about your fellow russian anna , in your half of the draw , assess her game .
what do you like about her game ?
what do you know about szavay ?
you are not in good preparation for this tournament , but you are in quarterfinal . can you explain how you are playing .
so you served for it at 5-4 in the second set and played a little bit sloppy , and got right back and broke her .
so now you 're in the quarterfinals for the third time this year in a grand slam . it 's not maria sharapova this time , it 's peer . you said on court she played you tough in practice , but an opponent you should be able to do well against . you think you will be able to play your game ?
what do you have to do this final to breakthrough ?
do you know why young players are playing very well in this tournament ?
some people described you as kind of a martina hingis-type player with more power . do you agree with that opinion ?
you were fan of milan football club . are you still a fan of milan ?
you still play football ?
what 's more important to you , to be thinking while you 're playing or to play with instinct and play from your gut ?
you still play pretty fast though . some players like djokovic take ten minutes to serve . you get right up there , right ? a couple bounces and boom , right into it .
can you describe your team , your small team around you ?
can you talk about what type of opportunity this is for you with the bottom half of the draw being so open with maria losing , and then also what it was like for to you play at night here .
can you talk about the kind of work you 've been doing with lansdorp . has he been telling you anything different ?
he 's known for having more repetition , and you play with a little more variety . you play a lot different than maria or lindsay .
do you work a lot physically and what about mentally ?
just some details .
alone ? you are by yourself ?
how did you come to be working with robert lansdorp ?
did you find an instant connection and that he was really helping you ?
i heard that you used to be a kind of player that 's really emotional , but now you look very calm and you stay calm and you 're really concentrate on the game . how did you make the transition ?
so what happened out there in that match ?
is that unusual for to you drink coffee before a match ?
what time did you get here ?
last year you were against henin your brain sort of froze on you . it backfired on you . tonight , completely different circumstance but you stayed mentally strong . do you look upon that as something you were really concentrating , this time i 'm going get through this ?
you had a difficult match in the last round as well , is this going to affect your confidence going forward ?
what was the hang-up today ? why did you go on later than you thought ?
was there any chance of them moving you to another court ?
first of all , did the coffee bother you at all ?
have you in the past in your career been good at winning matches when you did n't feel good ?
how have you come forward since playing justine here last year ?
you ran into a lot of very tough serving out there from venus . how much do you think that contributed to your inability to play your own game with her ?
were you nervous out there at all today ?
in the second set , was there a point in which you wondered , is she ever going have to hit a second serve ?

why do you think the two of you are able to bring out the best in each other ?
she said that one of the reasons why you have had some success against her and why the rivalry is so special is because you actually believe you can beat her at times . could the same be said on the other side ?

how ?
at new haven in the final when you hurt your back , was it on that final point where svetlana hit behind and you had to stop , or was it earlier in the match ?
yes .
so you had won the first set there ?

which players or player did you admire growing up ?
just talk about the last six games because it seemed like everything just fell part .
can you talk about how much of this match was about you not being there 100 percent or was it more about her just playing great ?
did you feel like you were not there this morning before the match or was it just sort of as it got underway ?
with the serve was the wind playing a factor with the toss , and was she a little bit distracting when she 's kind of dancing around ?

after the first set , did you adjust your game at all because you came out so strong in the second set ?

what 's the emotion now , the defending champion and sort of an earlier exit than you wanted ?
have you ever had an opponent move that far up close to the service line on your second serves ?
we asked her about that , and she said maria sharapova did n't like it , did that as a tactic to try to throw you .
your dad left after 5-3 in the third set .
at that point , did you pretty much know at the change that nothing 's working for me ?
what did you your father tell you after the match ?
how long does it take to you recover ?
despite all your off-court success , you 've always been very good at directing yourself , and you enjoy the winning so much on the court . does a campaign like this year make you feel even more that hunger going forward ?
yeah .
does she have what it takes to win a major do you think ?
what happened to your second serve today ?
when pro tennis was really getting started , it was so much about the tennis . it 's really grown into such a massive industry and entertainment and the glamour side . when you were growing up , did you ever anticipate how much the emphasis would be on the business side and the exposure and all the great opportunities ? do the players just take this for granted now , that it 's really a business ?

did you notice that she was very nervous out there ?
did you notice maria sharapova was very nervous out there with her serve ? did you feel that she was nervous ?
you were coming in very close , especially the second serve . did you do that to try to maker more nervous ?
what happened to you in the second set ?
how were you able to do that ? i mean , could get pretty discouraging to lose eight straight games . how were you able to turn it around ?
you played maria sharapova one other time this year . horrible third set . were you thinking a little bit about that match as you went into the third set today ?
were you always confident that you could stay with her from the baseline ?
how is it different , just the atmosphere when you 're playing somebody like that , center court and playing maria sharapova ? when you 're going into the match and you first step on the court , is it different ?

has anybody ever tried to do that to you to sort of try and psych you out ?
there was a lot of talk after the draw about the lower half of the draw , and that it was dominated by maria sharapova and a lot of the players at the top . did you think about that and look at that and say , there 's a tremendous opportunity here for somebody like yourself to get to a semi or final in the us open ?
but it will give you a big opportunity now . is that going to be a different challenge now because the draw has kind of opened up for you ?
have you done many press conferences ?
any time in your life .
you 're doing great .

today was a very tough day for seeds in your half of the draw .
by the time your match started , both nadia petrova and maria sharapova had left the drew with losses . did that play in your mind at all today ?
you make an interesting point . it seems that the media , myself included , seemed to not give enough credit to the more unknown younger players coming up . seems like there 's two-tier system . hingis and williams and now the jankovic and ivanovic and henins , and then there 's a bunch of other people that seem in the first early rounds they go . are we missing something completely ?
what happened out there today ?
how do you think you played ?

this is big news in serbia . ana was saying people at home were watching from day to night . are you getting any feedback from home ?
looked pretty easy out there today . was it as easy as it looked ?
you 're doing well , have a big following here . do you see this tournament as a way to becoming a household name such as maria sharapova ? do you see that as a goal of this tournament ?

on the wall ?
do you have any sense of how much people in belgrade are following this tournament ? is it on television ? every match ? radio ? do you have any idea ?

you 're smiling a lot this year . what 's going on ?
you won the first 10 games , then lost a game , and you looked awfully unhappy then .

est wearing a watch ever bother you on court ?
what kind of watch ? it 's a rolex , right ?

how did you feel about overall ?
is it tough to get a handle on things when you 're beating players by such a big margin ?

people have been talking about since the beginning of the tournament that the top half is much loaded .
well , let me show it to you .
well , the williams sisters --
but do you feel it 's better to be in your half of the draw at all ?
but why you do n't look at the draw ?
to dream .
are you happy the williams sisters , because they 're lower ranked , are in the other half of the draw ?
in the fed cup we have five italians coming to moscow . they all lost . so they are not anymore at the us open . are you going to play ?
you play ?
because petrova and chakvetadze played singles in the semifinals against the u.s. . are you going to be there to play singles ? you asked to play singles only ?
do you go because you want to play singles ?
having all the italians lost here , that means you are the strong favorite .
this is the only major where they play a tiebreak in the fifth set for the men . do you feel like tiebreaks on a faster surface are more important , you 're more apt to get into them and you have to be ready to play them on grass or cement ?

yes .

is the new racquet geared toward getting more pop into your serve ?
is it geared towards getting a little bit more power in your game ?
you used successfully a combination of dropshots and lobs out there today .
what 's your strategy going into tiebreakers ?
but put in that position , what is your thinking going into them ?
a player like you who has accomplished so much , can you really go out there in a match when you 're into a third or fourth round and really say , i have nothing to lose ?
but you would n't be in this tournament if you did n't think if you play at your level you can do some kind of damage ?

you 've probably dreamed about advancing in a tournament like this . being in the third round , the big press conference room , on the grandstand , is it what you thought it was going to be ? is it better ? how does it compare ?

what do you have under your left arm ? you have red things .
you started out the match kind of slow . you got broken in the first game . seemed early on you were questioning a lot of calls . did you feel off this morning ?

you used to be one of the kids in the crowd yourself ?
krstic of the nets was here watching you .
what 's your coaching situation ?
he 's here ?
another good match for you today . a good second round . clearly you 're in what everyone calls the harder half of the draw . one or two matches before you hit the opponents that start to get really hard . how do you feel about that ?
you and venus played almost identical second-round matches . your winners to unforced errors is 2-1. you really seem to be maybe the most consistent player on the women 's tour . do you think that 's why you 're at no.1 and why you have the best shot maybe at winning here ?
you say it may look easy . those of us that look at stats sheets , we see 6-4 , 6-love . is it deceptive ? even in the early-round matches , do you feel a little letdown can be an unpleasant result ?
how important is it in a fortnight tournament to try to get through in straight sets in terms of conserving your energy ?
this is the most important of the grand slams for you in a sense . outside of tennis circles , is that crucial to the endorsement opportunities or just going beyond ?
given all the emotional highs and lows for you this year between separation and reconciliation , have you made the decision to sort of go for it in the rest of your life outside of tennis , strike more of a balance between tennis ?
is the tennis court your sanctuary ?
seemed to serve very well . has that been feeling a lot better ?
you play casey dellacqua next . i do n't know if you know anything about her .
she had a good win today .
how do you handle somebody like that , not a big name but is obviously playing better ?
do you have a lot of trouble with left-handers ? do they bother you ? i mean there 's not a lot of left-handers .
have you changed you 're serving action to kind of compensate for the shoulder a little bit ?
talk about that a little bit .
how do you think it 's affected action of your serve itself ?
are you losing power as a result ?
it 's not even that you serve and volley . you did that a couple times tonight . coming into the tournaments that what , you were saying you could do that once in a while as a change-up ?
what would you give yourself grade-wise tonight ?
roberta said tonight that she 's suffered from a toothache this week .
had a toothache . had n't practiced in three days . she tell that you that ?
she said i probably would have lost anyway , but maybe not 6-0 , 6-1 .
when did the freak left shin injury go away ?
so you just sat there and watched them bowl ?
do you ever feel bad for an opponent when you 're beating them that quickly and easily ?
on the plays down the stretch though you had an opportunity to challenge a call that was borderline . i mean , if it were closer would you have challenged , or did the score dictate that ?
you did n't determine not to challenge because the score was so lopsided ?
when you get all dressed up for the nighttime at the us open , does it do anything to you psychologically almost like when you 're going out for a big evening out and you dress up and it pumps you up for the night ? when you come out , is that part of the whole ...
so it just gets you up when you 're putting on something special as opposed to just an average kind of dress ?
so how does it compare to the audrey hepburn outfit from last year ?
cocktails at tiffany 's ?
if you can do it in new york you can do it anywhere ?
venus was saying the other day sometimes she goes match by match in a tournament and other times , if she 's won a tournament , sometimes she says , this is mine and there 's no way i 'm going to lose it . do you feel like you have a little bit of a part of open now ?
you spoke about how you 've improved in the patience department . do you think if you put the maria sharapova of today up against the young maria sharapova who won her first grand slam at wimbledon , what would the score of a match be ?
it 's pretty amazing . but there 's some young players , like sampras when he was very young . but other players who are very young and get the moment are sort of overwhelmed . is there any distinction ?
what about this year ? talk about your approach at wimbledon and then last year . this year , how is it different ?
could you talk about your black jacket ? you wore it today when you walk on court .
is it a hard time to get back to 2004 here and get you back on track at this tournament ? is it time for you to get back to your championship form here ?
the hung hungarian girl you beat in the final in new haven , how tough was that match going to be if she did n't get hurt ?
at this time of year everybody 's a little beat up from eight months of tennis , and not many top players like to play the week before the us open . you did . did you want the momentum going into this tournament ? was that it ?
that 's has yankees logo ; is that correct ?
you like the yankees ?
yankee stadium has a grandeur to it , much history , much tradition . it 's a real sort of fixture in new york city and it 's part of new york experience to see the yankees .
that 's what i was going ask you really . for you to we 're that is symbolic , and the yankees are symbolic in new york . you have a grand slam title in new york . how much do you really enjoy coming to this city ?
justine said yesterday , you know , i asked a question about the atmosphere here and how some people really thrive and love it and others do n't care for it . she says she does n't personally really care for it . it 's not her favorite major . but you sound like you do . you really like get into this environment .
how it to feel today being back out on court and playing strongly ?
another russian player by the name of a sharapova loves this city , and she talks about eating in a different restaurant every night . is that you , or do you have a couple go-to places ?
what are your go-to places in new york ?
just in the last game today , you were running back and forth a lot and doing the splits a lot . was that very tiring ?
have you been to the sanchez cabin in naples yet ?
would it be convenient for you sometimes to be there rather than training ?
would there be enough players to hit there with you ?
how has your personal changed at all in the past year ? have you had any time to really enjoy it ?
anything you 've done while you 've been in new york city ?
did you give any thought to playing mixed doubles with jamie again here , or was that out of the question ?
you 're not playing together at this tournament . did you think about it ?
just because you want to focus on singles ?
considering your success here last year , do you come into this grand slam feeling as confident as you ever have coming into a grand slam ?
the match started 30 minutes later than most expected . was there a reason for that ?
since last year , you 've become , along with novak and ana , a national hero , which is something you were n't two years ago . how is that for you ?
i understand novak 's parents might be building a tennis center or some facility .
to help kids in tennis ?
what 's the name of the foundation ?
clearly a difference between this year and last year . what did it feel to be the first match on arthur ashe court , first day of the us open ?
do you still have the atp flip-flops that came from the player gift sack that you wore last year ?
you said you were nervous , not playing well . did that just catch up to you in the second set ?
are you still continuing your studies ?
is there any time right now during the slam ?
your major ?
after a couple years , what would you say is your favorite tournament on tour ?

do you remember back to your debut in oakland in '94 ? did you know where you 'd be going from there ? and do you ever think back to that night ?
had you psyched yourself to be playing henin and have to change your outlook when bartoli won ?
this is not the first time that you or your sister came back in a way and win again at a high level . how can you explain this ? you are the strongest , so you just need to be fit to win against anybody ?
this one puts you back in the top 20 for the first time in a year . at any point during this journey of the last couple years , did you doubt you would win another slam ?
did you feel as if you were going to be -- there was a lot of talk about you had other interests , options . was that the key , that you were interested enough to want to win again ?

what is it about the williams sisters and the wimbledon final ?
you both seem to love playing here and do really well . what is it that brings out the best in you here ?
if this had been the case earlier , to play justine , maybe vengeance would have been a theme , she having beaten serena . does that still come into play when you have a situation like this ?
will you talk to serena about playing justine ?
you won this at 20 and 21. now you 're 27. almost an old lady in tennis years . do people respond to you differently ? are they pulling for you more ?

in your gut do you think you 'll win this thing ?
is that a yes ?
you had a great answer the other day of finding clarity in the rain . how did you deal with clarity in the sunshine ?
serena was ranked 81st going into the australian open ; wound up winning . you 're one of the lowest-ranked finalists ever at wimbledon . do you see any parallels there ? any inspiration ?
is there anything that 's just a bit more fun about doing this when people do n't expect you rather than working from the no.1 ranking ?
people were also about to count you out on court 2 the other day . do you think you would have won that match if serena had n't been there courtside encouraging you ?
do you ever sit and think about what you and your sister have done , the statistics of so many wimbledon finals , titles ? do you ever look at the big picture and reflect on that ?
what does go through your mind when you go into a junior high school , see your picture , young people in adoration ?
how far do you think ana ivanovic can go ?
there does seem to be an intimidation . players play really well up until the point they see you and serena across the net and something happens . what is that ?

which for you is the stronger emotion now , happiness at making it to the semis or disappointment at losing ?
venus and serena , their rankings have dropped a lot , not playing much . the media sometimes , they 're forgotten about heading into a tournament . in the locker room and on tour , are they thought of still as being at the top ?
are you going back to belgrade now ?
after that are you getting ready for the us open ? hoping for the same kind of success ?
where will you stay when you go back to belgrade ? with your parents ?
when was the last time you stayed with them there ?
how shocked are you about what happened out there ?
you think it 's about what you did n't do rather than what she did ?
do you think you might put too much pressure on yourself to win here ?
is this arguably the toughest defeat of your career ?
do you think she can prove it was n't a freak result by winning against venus ?
with venus through relatively easily before you took the court , is getting through and conserving energy added pressure ?
are you surprised she 's never produced that level of tennis before ?
when players get in a zone like that , a lot of times eventually they come out of it . were you surprised , whether it was 4-0 , 5-1 , she never seemed to start missing balls and get affected by the magnitude of the situation ?
have you deconstructed anything with carlos yet ?
1-6 in the first set to the no.1 player in the world . how did you come back ?
yes .
tv personalities like cliff richard in the earlier match , does it not distract you having celebrities in the crowd ?
what is responsible for this transformation from losing to her in four games in eastbourne , four first-round losses to wimbledon final ?
were you ever overawed ? a lot of thunderbolts coming over the net . you seemed to be coping quite well .
thundering over the net . you were really coping well . were you ever overawed or nervous ?
can you believe you 're in the final ? is it still surprising to you ?
it would make your dad very proud .
what does that mean to you ? obviously he 's traveled with you .
probably the most distinctive thing about your game , other than two hands everywhere , is the accuracy of your groundstrokes . not necessarily the hardest in tennis but the accuracy is amazing . are there drills you 've used over the years to become such an accurate groundstroker ?
you mentioned pierce brosnan . what is your favorite bond movie ?
do you have an explanation for why french players do well outside roland garros ? gasquet trying to get into the semifinals . mauresmo was defending champion .
will you invite pierce brosnan into your box tomorrow ?
i spoke to pierce brosnan , and he says he has a wedding tomorrow but he 'll be with you in spirit . he has a picture if you want it . does that satisfy you ?
what will be the key for you to beat venus tomorrow ?
will it be hard to raise your game ? will it be hard to raise your game two days in a row ?
you 're very emotional on the court . fist pumps . your father is almost emotionless in the player 's box . he looked a little stunned after the match was over . how do you explain the differences in your personalities ?
you work with your father . has anybody else helped you with your tennis over the years ?
do you think the 2-love game in the final set was really key ?
two terrific performances in a row . how is it you can do that having earlier in the tournament two worrying matches ?
who was in your entourage supporting you from the gallery ?
the photography thing , your father is keen with his photographs . there was a lot going on there .
your boyfriend as well was in the box . does that help having him there to cheer you on ?
can you describe the feeling you get out there on centre court , in particular ?
obviously you 've had some special matches out there , three championships . do you feel a little bit like that 's your court ?
what is it about this place or grass that you really feel suits your game ? you 've been far more successful here than any other slam .
did you imagine you would be here at the beginning of the year with the wrist injury ? are you surprised at all to make it this far ?
can you take us through the last game . the second match point you basically called a board meeting before you hit that ball .
what was your first encounter with a grass court , seeing one , playing on one ?
did you play on the court ?
do you see a comparison to 2005 when you were also recovering from an injury and came through to win .
you 've lost this season twice to kuznetsova . was she not very good today or were you much stronger ?
do you feel you are ready to win this grand slam again , or do you prefer to think step by step , match by match ?
you 're close and protective of your younger sister . how do you feel when explayers criticize her ?
you said every year you have to raise something new . what 's new this year ?
are you seeing the ball better ?
how are you able to produce what you showed in the last two days , given the fact you have n't played much this year ?
you mentioned your returns being so good . first time i noticed how close you 're standing in . is that something new ?
do you do that more against some players than others ?
you 've been on tour for 13 years . what does that make you think ?
is there ever a moment at all over the last two years where you yourself wondered if you might not , let 's say , get to another grand slam final or win another championship ?
are you sensing any fear on the other side of the net ? are you sensing the intimidation factor yesterday and today ?
who would you regard as the favorite for the title here ?
does that mean you ?
now that serena is out and you 're still in , how will that affect your doubles ?
can you talk about either ivanovic or vaidisova ?
did serena say anything specifically to you before today 's match ?
a lot of players show a lot of emotions they do n't normally do because of the weather delays , getting frustrated and upset . how do you cope with it ?
how do you achieve clarity ? do you meditate ?
you must be the only player here who thinks like that , who actually enjoys the rain .
you 're a pretty emotional player on court , very likely emotional off the court , too . how are you going to put this nightmare behind you ?
will fed cup help ?
you served strongly in the first set . towards the end , nerves presumably played quite a big part .
did you feel her getting stronger through the match ? how did you feel she played ?
notwithstanding that terrible backhand volley near the end , you have a very high percentage of conversion of balls near the net , something like 90 % . can you be at the net more ? can you push yourself to the net more than you are ?
you and ana are part of this younger generation making a breakthrough . you could be having games like that against each other for years to come . you have great potential , the two of you , to be successful .
there 's two younger players and two more experienced players in the semifinal . how do you see the matchups going there ?
do you think because of what happened today you need to start working on the mental side of things ?
does that mean working with a sports psychologist more ?
no ?
how do you improve it , start to control those nerves ?
you 're going deep into events , losing against people getting into semis and finals . is it hard to look at the light at the end of the tunnel in this regard , or do you take anything encouraging away ?
is this the toughest loss of your career ?
what was ?
do you think your emotions are a strength of your play or not ?
when you were at 40-15 , 5-3 in the third set serving for the match , were you calm or a little anxious at that point ?
what happened to the cornrows ?
do you call it cornrows in russia ?
did serena help you with it ?
have you ever been hit by an ace before ?
how good is she on grass ? is she better on grass than other surfaces ?
is it different to play her here than playing anywhere else ?
is there still the intimidation factor with the williams sisters ? is that factor back again ?
how is the stopping and starting affecting your game ?
are you prepared to play on monday if you need to ?
it 's not driving you crazy , this kind of weather ?
venus seemed to be saying your cornrows might be painful for you . was it hurting you ?
next week is the marriage of kim clijsters . you are a good friend . did you receive any invitation ? if not , do you still have some contact with her ?
next saturday .
who cut your hair ?
do you think venus will win the tournament ?
more than justine henin ?
are you more surprised for the final reached in paris or the semifinal reached here ?
the first time on centre court , did it strike you how far you 've come since the swimming pool ?
what are your thoughts and emotions as you walk onto this court for the first time ?
you looked more emotional at the end than you have at the end of some of your previous matches .
out of those three match points , which one do you think she should have played better or do you think it was you playing very well , those three ?
what were you wearing on your knee ?
just normal strapping ?
was there an injury of some sort ?
how hard is it to play aggressively on match points ? many young players on match points will play nervous . the two you took , you played super aggressive .
you said you were nervous at the beginning . centre court , is that what made you nervous ?
what is your take on the crowd at centre court , the whole wimbledon experience so far ?
are you surprised by that ?
novak is through also . serbians have had a fantastic run this year . why the breakout this year ? did they change the water supply ?
do you think what you went through as a country has given strength ?
does the story line of it ever amaze you ?
what changed once you came back from paris in serbia towards you , towards djokovic ? do they write much more about tennis than before ?
thoughts on the semifinal ?
being in the final in paris , then in semifinal here at wimbledon , totally different conditions , how did you manage to adapt to these new conditions within two weeks ?
was that just sort of a career day from her and not a great one from you ?
were you surprised how strong she was off the ground , especially on her forehand side ?
with the rain , all the backlog of matches , lots of people have been saying this is the worst ever wimbledon . do you think that ?
are you very disappointed or are you telling yourself you 've had struggles with the injuries this year , there 's nothing you could have done except for work , work , work ? are you thinking you should have been able to bring a better level today ?
did the fact that she took a toilet break before the game contribute to your slow start in any way ? does it disrupt your concentration ?
will you be playing fed cup ?
would you like to ?
did you take a calculated gamble that perhaps the tournament might set the injury back a little while ?
the scans , is that something you do as a matter of course after every tournament or match ? what prompted that ?
have you felt any kind of acute pain in it while you 've been playing or been here ?
what is it telling you ? is it gradually getting better ?
venus has not had a very good year to date . is it wimbledon ? is that why she 's all of a sudden able to raise her level by 200 % or so ?
is that possibly because when you 're facing another champion and great player you automatically step on court and know you have to raise it ?
how would you compare how venus played today versus the other times you played her ?
in the second set , towards the end , were you trying to fire whatever would fire and it just was n't happening ? was that bit frustrating ? sometimes it 's just not your day .
who is the best tennis player so far in this tournament ?
in terms of chances of winning .
fed cup , the russian team just released the list of players and you 're on it . did you not talk to them , or did you say you would be on the team but there 's an `` if '' involved depending on the shoulder ?
martina navratilova was saying on the broadcast she suspects your confidence has n't still recovered from australia . is there validity to that ? does that enter your thinking , especially against the williams sisters ?
was that a gutsy dropshot you made at 15-30 in the final game ?
knowing if you had missed that dropshot or she got it , you would have been looking at two breakpoints and a lot of momentum .
what 's the difference between playing serena on clay and grass ?
before you served at 15-30 , you were talking to yourself . what were you saying ?
did you have to assume she was fully fit ?
is key biscayne on your mind ?
what would it mean to you to hold up the plate on saturday ?
you were concerned coming in here with your overall fitness just as much sort of mentally and emotionally because of having won paris . what 's the status report on your enthusiasm , energy level , emotional fitness ?
what do you do away from the court to keep fresh mentally ?
is that focused on the match or completely shut off from tennis ?
you 've spoken about how you 're in a happier place now . does that help in the big matches ?
who is the best grass court player you 've ever seen ?
your backhand is usually the shot you use to open up the court for your forehand . today it seemed like your backhand was the more devastating weapon . did serena allow you to use your backhand today ?
what kind of music do you enjoy ?
how was it to be playing with the threat of rain , knowing it was possibly damp ?
how does it feel to be a semifinalist at wimbledon ?
yesterday you said during the match with jankovic you had a chance during the rain delay to see points on television and analyze them . did you get the chance again today ?
it 's the second match that you played brilliantly the third set . what gives you strength to finish so well ? is it your physical form , mental toughness ?
how can you practice that in a training situation ?
is it your father who makes the drills for you ?
your unusual and yet very effective style reminds us of monica seles . was she an inspiration for you ?
was there any particular reason that you did n't sleep well last night ?
how were you able to do one hour of sleep during the rain break ?
in the locker room ?
how did you wake up ?
did you have any dreams at that time ?
can you tell us what was going through your mind in the first set because you looked very angry at times ?
who were those looks aimed at in the crowd ?
you know you 're going to be playing one of the biggest players in the semifinals . might you be a bit sleep-deprived because of nerves before that one ?
amlie mauresmo is the champion from last year . she 's out . do you think you could potentially go further and emulate her ?
what was your first thought after winning the match ?
when someone has an unusual style , often people around would say it 's not going to work , you have to change . what gives you strength at the end of the day when you prove all the opponents wrong ?
this is your third appearance in wimbledon . in 2005 you reached the third round ; 2006 , you reached the fourth round . where do you see yourself in this championship , having now defeated the champion ?
not semifinal or final ?
what were the keys for you to be able to beat a defending champion ? i know you 've beaten her a couple time before , but it 's different circumstances here .
how much of a mental battle is it to play someone like her ? first set was tough . the second was tough . third set it seemed like you were locked in there .
what was it like off and on , off and on , with all the rain delays ?
could you describe the physical sensation of playing on grass . does n't happen very often , but ...
in the third set she seemed to almost give up , give away quite a few points to you . were you surprised how easy it was to win that third set ?
do you remember the point of your career when you started sharing the court with players like mauresmo , not feeling intimidated against players that won grand slams or achieved a lot in their careers ?
was there a moment or particular match where you felt like you really discovered that belief against these type of players ?
how nervous were you getting as it came to the finishing line ?
what is your favorite surface ?
you 're starting to develop a love for grass ?
do you feel like you 're ready to win wimbledon this year ?
when you say you have to get used to grass , what does that mean ? movement ? shot selection has to be different ?
you 're a big hitter . do you find your ball penetrates more ? do you like serving ?
your forehand , do you think that 's a big shot on grass ?
do you think one of the keys of your win was the return of serve ? she seemed to be worried , made a lot of double-faults because she was afraid with her second serve . do you think that was a key ?
can you talk about your mental maturation since you reached the french open semifinals last year , whether you feel like you 've grown up and are more composed on court ?
who were your role models when you were growing up ? do you remember watching wimbledon as a kid ?
were you able to meet her ?
can you talk about ivanovic or petrova ?
it was presumably quite important not to let her get a foothold in the match early today .
was it more comfortable than you expected it to be , given she took dementieva out yesterday ?
you played a couple young players in the last two rounds . do they play differently than the older players , maybe some intimidation on the court ?
how would you assess her game ? what 's her potential ?
do you see her at top 10 , top 20 , top 30 ?
fed cup , will you be on the team ?
who else is going to play ?
is your game in the sort of shape to take you to your best ever wimbledon this year ?
you 're going to play maria or venus , two players that have won here . is your game at a point , if you play well , you can seriously challenge them ?
i 'm asking you . just talk about your level and the challenge that those two present to you .
you played enough grand slams now . when you go into a grand slam and you 're playing at a good level , how much of the outcome is determined by your mental and how much of it is technical ?
what 's the most interesting remark you 've received about your hair since you got here ?
in the last week and a half since you got to wimbledon , who has made the most interesting remark ?
venus and serena say anything ?
-- advice ?
so how long did it take ?
if it 's 70 % mental , what do you do to get yourself mentally in a great space so when you 're on the court things do n't go away from you ?
you served and volleyed a bit in the match . are you trying to incorporate that more into your grass court play ? is it something you 'll try against players like maria or venus , or was it you were comfortable with your lead in the match ?
was it a mistake not to play on sunday ?
yesterday serena williams collapsed on the court with a serious calf injury . have you ever been in a match where your opponent had a serious injury and you just did n't know how to play against her because psychologically you went out of your game plan ?
could have gone pretty much either way right till the end .
tough to finish when you 're three points from the match ?
was that one of the toughest grand slam matches you played , if you take into account the weather , your opponent ?
it 's 15-all , the rain comes . what do you do ?
when did you first play on grass ?
what did you think of it then ?
where was that first time ?
how have you been enjoying london ?
did you meet anyone there ?
were you nervous at all ?
did people recognize you there ?
who did you go with ?
are you hearing a lot from belgrade wanting radio interviews or things like that ?
how much did the rain delays affect the quality of your game , and did it prove you were mentally stronger in the end ?
big surprise for you to be in the quarterfinals of wimbledon . what do you think about your next opponent ?
what do you know about her ?
you looked really tired at the end of the match . were you exhausted when you were closing out your victory ?
did you tweak a hamstring ?
you 're okay now ?
is that the best result of your career ? how do you rank it ?
at the end of the match you looked happy but not sensationally happy .
can we still see a french champion this year ?
are you friendly with amlie at all ?
if they call you to play in fed cup against italy , will you go ?
if they do select you ?
you played jelena at the same stage of the french open and managed to take only two games from her . what was the difference today ? the surface or are you playing better ?
are you one of the french players who 's been able to go to the british embassy in paris to practice ?
in practice you seem to have a very intensive fitness regime . have you always had that , or did you start it at a specific stage ?
zurich .
how did you keep focused during the rain breaks ?
were you irritated when jelena was messing with her contact lens ?
it seemed to affect your concentration .
your friends in the locker room that you were laughing , what kind of things were you talking about ?
final point of the match , any of nerves ?
so no nerves ?
were you worried the rain would interrupt it ? it started coming down heavy right at the end .
did you come into wimbledon with any expectations ?
the match was stopped . can you tell us , did you talk to larri ? did he give you some advice how to play her ?
so you changed it ?
have you always had a killer backhand ?
how did you manage to stay relaxed for those two days ? did you go out somewhere , get away ?
the backhand down the line , it 's a shot you do n't see too much from very young players . it 's one of your best shots . how did you develop that and how long has it been a big weapon for you ?
is this the biggest win of your career ?
can you talk about your background as a player , when you started player , who encouraged you to play ?
obviously you 've gotten good very quickly . when did you know you were going to be a very good player ?
you got to the finals of the juniors here . how much had you played on grass before that ?
could you tell us about your camp . you always looked to them with your fists . you 're very close ?
how did you get in touch with larri passos ?
how did you meet him ?
elena must have caught an awful lot of balls today , service tosses . did you find that distracting at all ?
even if you were to talk away now , you 'd take a check with you for nearly $ 100,000 . what does that mean to you ? do you have any treats planned for you ?
you say you have a lot of memories about wimbledon . which are these memories ? some players you saw ?
any players which were idols of yours , someone you wanted to imitate ?
when you went over when serena was down on the ground , what did you think was wrong with her ?
how difficult did you keep your concentration on serena 's cramp ?
when it started to rain , what went through your mind ?
the longer one .
as the third set went on , what did you think of her injury situation ?
you do n't think you had any advantages in the third set ?
how will you remember this match ?
what about the opportunity that you had there ? what was going through your mind when you saw she was clearly not herself ?
serena said when you hit the dropshot she got fired up . do you have any thoughts or comments about that ?
i think the first one after her injury .

was this a match that serena won or that you lost ?
by the end of the match , you complained to the referee ?
you asked him to suspend and he did n't want to ?
do you definitely think the match should have been called off ?
do you think if it had been a match point for you and not a former wimbledon champion at that point , they might have called the match off ?
do you actually feel cheated as well as disappointed , that it ended that way ?

how would you sum up your first week at wimbledon this year ?
was your forehand as reliable as you would have liked today ?
can you describe the treatment that you do with your shoulder between matches .
how long does all that take ?
because it 's venus and she 's a three-time champion here , is the intensity level different even though it 's a fourth-round match ?
when you say `` needle work , '' is that acupuncture ?
pretty good all around ?
give me your assessment of how you feel you 're playing , how you played today .

you 've talked about this a ton , but you 'll be going into the second week . is it a different mentality ? you 'll get saturday off , sunday off , then monday . different attitude ? is it game time ?
43 minutes . did it feel like one of the quickest matches in a long time for you ?
henin in the quarters .

i saw it on the internet .
do you know laura 's game at all ? do you sort of feed off each other when you 're playing well ?
if form holds , venus likely will play maria in the fourth round . i 'm wondering if you plan to break that match down for venus , because you 've had some good success against maria ?
on the bbc they were claiming you might have been inspired by meeting jonathan ross on his talk show .
how was that for you ?
claimed he might have groped you or something .
assess your level today . did she just not play well ? were you really in control of the match ?

you may be aware that the wta announced today a number of things , including qatar , istanbul , and changed the scoring rules for doubles .

did you sense martina was maybe a little bit off her game ?
you campaigned for equal winnings for men and women . when you look at the amount of time spent on court for men and women , women earn almost double than men compared to per minute the time on court . do you think that 's fair ?
what do you think need now to be more ambitious for this tournament ?

are you happy with that ?
when you feel yourself doing that during the set , you 're not the same in the first , but you ca n't change it ?
seemed almost to be more frustrated with yourself than with the challenge in front of you . was that the case , particularly during the second set ?
we all know how competitive you are . if you were to take eight to ten weeks off and just get rid of the shoulder problem , you 'd miss the us open , a lot of tennis that you do n't want to miss . but thinking long range , why is n't that the best solution for you ?
if after taking those three weeks off you work diligently on that , by the time san diego , stanford , you do n't feel any significant improvement , will you rethink what you want to do ?
you 're so young , so much career ahead of you . is there an endangerment this will linger on for two or three more years ?

at the french open i saw your dad laughing and smiling .
can you talk about him . we really do n't know that much about your dad .
does his humor come from his innocence or love of life ?
at the start of the third set , you looked the favorite to win that match . did you feel as though you could win it at that point ?
you were on top at that point .
you had sort of mixed emotions about the day because you came very close , which is great , but you also might have won , which would have been better .
what do you have to work on ?
you had a very serious surgery . there must have been times when you thought if you would play again .
there were quite a lot of disputed calls today . do you think maybe it was because of the wind ? both of you were querying the calls .
what do you head off to do now ?
tournament .
given your rapid progress the last few months , have you set yourself a target where you want to be at the end of the year and this time next year ?

did you feel limited at all today because of the injury ?
so how much does it affect you mentally as well as the physical limitation ?
what 's in the book that you have on court ? just notes ?
they 're going to be plowing court 2 .
they 're going to get rid of court 2 that you played on , and you 've had some tough matches out there in your career .
they 're going to do it under , as far as i understand , and bring it back as a stadium-type court in '09 . the question is , are you going to be glad to see that court go ?
when you got emotional in the first set , was that down to your injury ?
was there any point there where you think to yourself in the first set , i ca n't lose to this person ? what goes through your mind ? what are you telling yourself at that point ?

you 've been drawn in the same quarter again as justine . does that concern you at all ?
are there any other times you 've had to have a chat with your dad about things he said to people he should n't have , not necessarily in tennis , but just being your dad ?
to embarrass you with the family .
when you come to a tournament like this and the draws come out , what are you really looking for , especially if venus is also in the tournament ?
if she 's not in the same half , you think , this is good ?
can you talk about the decision to play doubles .
what does it add ? does it help you with singles when you play doubles ?

your doctor was quoted today in a belgian newspaper saying you could be forced to quit tennis in a couple of years through injury . how true is that ?

on paper at the start of the tournament , you looked like you had a very hard road . does that make this slam the most satisfying of the three , do you think ?
you spoke about billie jean on the television interview . can you tell us how that started , how often she does sort of offer you advice and congratulations ?
is it all done by text , or do you ever talk to her ?
you seemed really driven to win this title . you 've done that . what now ? obviously you want to win other titles . justine has been the dominant force the last six months . would you like to achieve that sort of domination ?
i think you made a nice speech today . that comes with experience also , or you prepare sometimes a little bit before ?
you 're going to play for russia in the federation cup the first time . what circumstances have changed that you 're going to play when you 've missed previous ones ?
the olympics is obviously in your sights .
although you live in america , the russian heritage is something that means a great deal to you ?
is it going to be one of your priorities also to get a better relationship with the other russian girls , kuznetsova , chakvetadze , dementieva ? because they were in moscow when you were there in the final of the fed cup . i did n't have the impression that there was a big nice feeling between you . just you and vesnina were very close .
chakvetadze said , i do n't understand why maria came for the final .
in your speech , you mentioned the tragic events within your camp last year . how much did that change your perspective ?
did you have any problems with ana 's squeaky shoes ?
you mentioned the olympics . if i could offer you the olympic gold medal or another wimbledon , you could only have one of them , what would you have ?
would you like to play the final at night ?
how was the feeling of your second grand slam final compared to your first ?
was anxiety and nerves ever a factor out there ?
did you think she played well today ?
was the heat on center court , did that have any effect on you at all ?
you said all tournament you have n't really played your best tennis here in the last few weeks . was that the case again today ? if so , what do you need to work on ?
her serve was outrageous today , barely losing a point .
did you regret the dropshot most of all ?
sometimes in sport you need to have a loss like this to give you incentive for the next time , maybe like maria had last year . will you build on this one now and work on next year ?
did novak get a chance to speak to you before you went out to play today ?
will you stay to watch it ?
can you see more grand slam final encounters with maria ?
you 're going to play fed cup . it will be the first time ?
do you enjoy this grand slam more than any other one you 've played in yet ?
what does australia day at mentone hold for the rest of the night ? barbecue out the back ?
how would you describe today 's match ? was it difficult out there for being off the court for a while ?
was it important to keep your focus when she 's injured , when she 's honestly not moving quite as well as she 's like to be ? do you have to retain the focus on what you 're doing ?
have you ever managed a grand slam better going into the final ? meaning that you 're pretty much going out there , you know what you have to do , you 're executing and not getting pushed that much .
you seem so driven to win this tournament . can you go back to before christmas and tell us how about you started to mentally and physically prepare for it ?
is there a sense that there 's a little bit of kind of unfinished business as far as this particular championship is concerned ?
i mean , you want it for all the right reasons , anyway . but after what happened in the final with serena , is this something you really , really want to put right ?
your father 's very visible . how would you say your mother contributes in a positive way to your career ?
what would happen if she had to sit beside your father during matches ?
how often do you see her ? i mean , how often it happens that are there , within one year ?
you have n't talked about it that much , but how tough was it for you not to see her for two years when you were young ? because that 's pretty tough on a young kid not to see their mom .
she must like very much her privacy , because i 've never seen a picture of her . i do n't even know if she 's blond or black hair .
can you describe her ?
what are you most pleased about with your game at the moment , the last few games ? what 's pleased you most ?
did you tell yuri to leave the hoodie at home today ?
he was very conservative today . that was nothing to do with the reaction of the media and the focus on the ...
were you surprised that on the first set hantuchova won so easily ?
6-love . 6-love , 2-1 .
yeah .
6-love is quite an astonishing score for the first set .
what do you remember of the wimbledon semifinal ?
in '04 , yeah .
apart from hitting the ball well , there seems to be a confidence that maybe was n't always there last year . in this off-season , did you do any sort of sports psychology or performance training ?
roger said last night that if a player has n't had much experience in big games they might blink a little bit in important moments . you touched on that a little bit after the game . how much can you use that experience with whoever your opponent is ?
how painful was it for you physically and mentally ?
what are you going to do now with these injuries ? are you going to take time off ?
in hindsight , should you have played doubles the other night ?
before you leave australia will you have another drive by a yellow lambourghini ?
do you expect her to win the title ?
yes .
it seemed like when you came back on the court after that medical timeout you had some emotion in your face . was that from the pain or just from the situation ?
we do n't know who maria is going to play , but can you just break down how that match might play out with either daniela or ana ?
how have you been going on the way through ? have you been traveling at 70 percent , 80 percent ? you obviously have n't been 100 percent since a couple of weeks ago . what percentage terms have you been battling through since the opening round ?
how concerned are you about what the injury might do to your year ?
last year i think you played any tournaments than any other woman in the top 10. will you rethink that approach ?
how much did the game against serena take out of your body ?
could you tell us about the match , the start , which was not too good , and how you got back into it and the finish ?
how do you avoid having a slow start in the final ? you said you were a little bit more nervous at the start of this one . obviously the nerves will be built up in the final . how did you overcome that ?
did it surprise you how strongly daniela came out ?
does a comeback win like that give you great confidence to go into a final against maria ?
is maria 's form daunting as well ?
how much of it is going to be about matching her intensity level , number one ; and then number two , making sure you do n't get off to a slow start and then she gets off on a roll and it just goes away ?
the break ball in the serve says a lot about your legs .
the break ball in the serve , you have to retrieve the ball very difficult . you can do it with your legs ; your movement was very good .
daniela was very upset with the amount of noise your shoes were making on the court . she thought the squeakiness of your shoes , particularly when you 're returning serve , is a form of gamesmanship , and you 're deliberately making a lot of noise with your shoes on the court .
are you a natural squeaker , or are these courts squeakier than other courts ?
could you sense it was annoying her at the time ?
it 's one thing to think coming into a tournament your form is there and your fitness is there and you 're ready to get back to a grand slam final , but it 's another thing to really know it . coming in , did you know , yeah , i 'm a little different player now , i can really bring up my game this time ?
may i ask you , when you talk in serbian , do you always talk like that , the way you talk in english , all breathless ? especially when you talk to your boyfriend , do you talk like that ?
in an ideal world , would you have preferred to have a match like maria 's in the semifinal or the match you had going into a final ?
everybody 's been talking about the wind coming from the eastern european countries . but then at the end , you were raised up as a tennis player more or less in switzerland ; the other three girls in america with bollettieri . so is that real , the eastern wind or is nothing to it ?
you 're the new no.2 in the world . how it feels ?
it 's printed in the notes of the wta .
players have come off post-match and said they had injuries going into the game . do you go into the final absolutely injury-free ?
why do you think people were supporting you so much ? because you play very well or for other reasons ?
you did n't answer the question . why ?
is it difficult to keep your concentration when maria is going through her routine for service ? how do you keep your focus on ?
what would be the qualities you admire in sharapova ?
in all the time you 've played tennis , has any other opponent ever complained about the squeakiness of your shoes ?
you still have relations to switzerland ?
when were you there last time ?
have you ever played as well as you did in that first eight games ?
how did it get away from you ?
how hard is it to accept a defeat after you started so well and you were up 8-0 .
you 've said before that you 're very , very hard on yourself , you 're a perfectionist . so have you gotten better at not being so hard on yourself , and will this be the hardest one of all to get over ?
do you think ana 's experience to get to the french open 's final last year came into play at all ?
after such a long match , you had a very cursory handshake there at the end . was that the disappointment , or had she done something to displease you ?
did you have any issues with the double bounce or the ...
so you actually saw it double bounce , though ?
did you raise that with the umpire ?
what about the way she squeaks her feet when she returns ?
did you say anything to the umpire ?
is that something you 've come across anyone else doing , or that 's the first time that 's happened ?
when she had the last challenge and she stopped the ball and she did n't play the last point , then you had made the point . instead you replayed , and then you did n't say anything at this moment .
how do you break down the final with maria ?
do you still think you look at this tournament as a breakthrough ?
why do you think that got away from you ?
was your strapped thigh any hindrance ?
what did it specifically affect , the thigh ? was it the serve , pushing off for the serve ?
she 's talked a lot about having more fitness . did you feel she was running more balls down ? how much has she improved in the last few months ?
do you think you 're still improving in your game ?
can you specify what is wrong with your leg now that this is over for you ?
are you affected by her squeaking when you tossed the ball ?
second thoughts about two hours of doubles yesterday ?
has to be a long time , if ever , since you and serena lost singles and doubles within 24 hours at a big tournament . if people start talking about the williams era being over , what would you have to say to them ?
is there any lingering bad feeling or unfinished business with the scheduling issue the other night ? you were talking to craig tiley about it .
do you feel that was handled right ? did you feel like you were blamed for that in any way ?
obviously you reached the final here and had good results but never quite won the title . anything in particular that 's stopping you winning here ? is it the time of year that does n't suit you ?
what is your schedule the next few months ?
you would n't consider playing indian wells ? there 's a lot of points there .
the first six of the seven games went against serve . did you find serving out there hard ?
the game is indebted to you because you raised the level of play when you were at your very best . now you 're partially responsible for everybody playing better , trying to catch up to you . have you noticed a difference in the level of play as a group ?
losing the doubles and serena losing yesterday , in any way do you try to avoid a down feeling ?
how many tournaments do you plan to play doubles in ?
all the slams , though ?
how did you enjoy your first quarterfinal ?
did you notice a different intensity from a quarterfinal , different to other matches you would have played in the past ?
were you nervous at all ?
was daniela one of the players you admired as a young girl ?
would you say it was a question of playing on the biggest court ? but you played arthur ashe in new york . huge stadium , big crowds .
what lessons can you take out of today ?
she seemed to be forcing you behind the baseline .
do you think you 'll be able to take that and develop in your own game ?
so you think your experience may have helped on those crucial points ?
where do you go after this ?
and driving lessons ?
why did you win it ?
serving for the match at 15-40 , was that the most pressure you 've ever experienced on a tennis court ?
having never won a set against her before , what does this mean to you ?
in a few hours time serbia is going to wake up to find out they 've definitely got two semifinalists , maybe three . what is the reaction going to be ?
why do you think it is that players from eastern european countries are dominating the game at the moment ?
can you explain about the huge improvement you did in movement .
did you do something special ?
how were you introduced to scott byrnes , > what was his previous experience as a trainer ?
do you think this is a significant moment in women 's tennis with the williams sisters both out and justine out before the semifinals ?
you mentioned daniela . are you surprised to see her in the semifinals ? she never made one before .
how are you actually enjoying writing a column for the local newspaper here ? have you had any response from the people of melbourne to your columns ?
the australian public talks a lot about you because you have family here . do you feel a little bit a favorite of the home crowd ?
on your blog we never read anything about your boyfriend .
was the match as easy as the scoreboard indicated ?
is this an extension to your good form of last year ?
do you think it might be a different story if you did n't get rid of your doubles game ?
is it a nice change to have everyone talking about your tennis as opposed to things going on in your personal life or your appearance ?
you 've been playing a number of years now . first grand slam semifinal . what does this mean to you ?
do you notice anything you 're doing differently this time that got you to this stage ?
in the past , when you would make those mistakes , what would go through your head ?
how much do you miss kim clijsters ?
are you in touch still ?
have you spoken to her during the tournament ?
did you get nervous serving for the match the first time ?
is it tough playing out there ? the match at the moment , six of the first seven games went against serve .
can you tell us how working with marco has helped you out ?
how did you come across each other ?
are you surprised a little bit that , as good as you were even five years ago , that it took you this long to reach a semifinal of a grand slam ?
you see other players walk around , like the williams sisters and maria sharapova . they give the sense they feel as though they should be in grand slam finals . do you feel you should be in a grand slam final ?
was there a moment that you can remember believing that , a specific moment made you think you do belong ?
you 'll face a stiff test either way in the semifinals . you 'll probably know whether your game is at the point you can beat an elite player . what do you have to do to bring your best ?
could you clarify for us how many languages you speak ?
how would you rate your opponent 's game today compared to your last meeting in zurich last year ?
you said it 's taken you some time to build the maturity and experience to be able to play at this level . have you got any regrets from the past five years ?
do you still have any time to play piano ?
is it something that in the past helped you to relax ?
what are your favorite types of pieces to play when you do have time ?
the easy stuff ?
for your home country i think you 're the best slovakian player so far going that far . does it mean something for you coming from that small country ?
will you celebrate this victory or do you have to put it behind you immediately and focus on the semifinals ?
how much does the doubles game help you to be successful in singles ?
you 're not playing mixed doubles here . is there any reason ?
what are your comments on the singles ?
you were quite listless in the first set there . was n't an injury or a problem with movement ?
any comments on the way she played ?
did those issues extend to the doubles ? was there a bit of a problem all through the day ?
how much do you think it restricted you in your singles match ?
it seemed like even when you were trying hard in the second set to get things going you just could n't find your rhythm .
was playing doubles therapeutic after that , or would you just rather just have gone back and rested ?
looked like during the doubles you were sort of grabbing your leg up here . is it the knee again ?
she went into it saying she wanted you to move from side to side . did that make it difficult for you ? was that a good tactic of hers ?
you 've been in some tough physical situations before , tough mental situations before . she failed hold to serve out the match . you come out and it looked like you had a good opportunity to get back to 5-5. you could n't get it together . what was n't really happening today ?
you were treated for a blister during the match , right ?
was that a factor during the match or not ?
what about the sun , serena ? we do n't see you in a cap too often down here . was that a problem ?
last year people did n't expect too much of you . when you came here this year everybody expected a lot of you . did that make a difference ? you 've been in a lot of pressure situations , but was it a lot different walking in here with those expectations this year than last ?
given that you felt that way , what are your feelings now ? how disappointed are you ?
whatever was affecting you physically , did you start to feel that more after the first couple days of the first set ? because it seemed like you lost some energy there after those first couple of games .
when did it come up for you as an issue , the injury ?
that 's still no real clear explanation . you played pretty well against vaidisova , but it did n't seem like you were trusting any of your shots today .
you mentioned before that you felt you had done a bit better in the doubles . what exactly did you feel you had done better in the doubles ?
you recently said you 're a happy person with a smile on your face . how easy is it to put that smile back on your face after a day like today ?
you 're not staying for the police concert ?
it 's been like six , seven years since you were in four slams and failed to pass the quarterfinal . what do you think about the year moving forward ? just talk about your general state of mind .
did that injury get you out of a lot of tournaments last year ? can we expect to see you on the tour a bit more this year ?
can you talk about venus ' chances ? she 's been playing pretty well , and she 's never won here . she 's in a good side of the draw and looks like she has a good opportunity moving forward too .
you probably played one of the best matches i 've ever seen . do you think , is that true or not ?
you are a always pretty aggressive in your games , but tonight in the first couple of games did you move it up a notch or two for the start of the match ?
were you surprised at the number of errors that she did make ?
apart from being aggressive , you played slice backhands , dropshots , lobs , with more variety than usual .
you do you think that is ...
no , i 'd just like to know if it was a strategy , if it was a special evening , or you always play like that ?
did you sort of feel like you were in the bubble out there tonight , your own little bubble ? do you feel like you 're really in the zone this tournament ?
do you now feel the tournament is yours for the grabbing , playing at that level ?
you played very well . do you have the feeling that she was a bit slower than usual or not ?
even though you 're saying it 's all on your side of the net , you have to be real happy you won a lot of those long scramble points , because against her that 's particularly tough .
you were a bit tough on your on-court interview .
yeah , regarding your tv commentators .
do you think you 've been unfairly treated ?
criticism . what did you mean when you were answering the question on the on-court interview ?
about your slice backhand .
the other day you said your dad looked like an assassin in his camouflage hoodie .
today like in the post-match celebration he would you have had like a throat thing .
throat slitting action . what did think about that ? would you have had you see it ?
he made this motion like this ( indicating ) .
no , he just made an action where he went like this ( indicating ) .
no , like a throat slitting action .
in the latter part of the first set , justine started to mix it up a little more , started to slice . you really adjusted your game . started to change it up a bit . you always talked about your game as evolving . do you feel you were able to see that and weather the storm when she changed things up on you a bit ?
you never lost to jelena on the hardcourts . does that make sort of an advantage before the battle ?
do you have any strong memory of playing her in the juniors , like your best bollettieri story ?
many players , they say they focus just on themselves , on their game . they do n't look at the other 's game . is that really true ? i mean , you do n't realize if someone , for instance , could be limping or could be making more mistakes with the backhand than with the forehand ? you focus , but you see what is going on on the other side or you do n't ?
the reason why i made this question was because in french , more than in english , justine said she had a problem to her knee .
that she had a problem to her knee . that she had sort of inflammation . that she can not run properly and so on . and she said , i do n't want to make an excuse .
so she was saying both things . i do n't want to make an excuse , but with the french colleagues ...
but you did n't notice anything ?
are you being allowed to play to that instinct you talked about because your body is in much better shape than last year ?
are you in much better shape now ? are you feeling in much better shape ?
no , injury-wise .
for a competitive person like yourself , an aggressive person , is patience the hardest skill to learn ? and is there anything off the court that 's helped you become more patient in your game ?
i 'm just asking , because you said you were more patient . you felt that you have become more patient .
after wimbledon you changed your service motion then you were in san diego . now you seem to be back on your ...
do you find that this surface is giving more action to the ball , particularly on the wide serve ?
yes .
on the slice and on the wide serve ?
your best ever grand slam win ?
is that your best ever grand slam win ?
what did you like about your game ?
congratulations . you served for the match . did you get a little shaky in that game ?
do you think you played your best tennis ever , or do you think we can see even better ?
i bet you remember your first match here and now you 're sitting here . did you say a little prayer ?
must give you incredible motivation .
did you feel as if serena was wounded in any way ? were you surprised at how slowly she started the match , especially ?
how injured are you ?
are you seriously hurt somewhere in your body ?
all that twisting the trainer does with your leg , does that give you relief , or are you going to have to get a new leg before the tournament is over ?
you almost lost in the first round and you struggled through most of your rounds . how do you explain sort of your more solid performance today ?
did you feel less pressure ? did you feel like the underdog ?
how did you obtain such mental toughness ? were you born with it , or have you worked on it ?
have the aches and pains subsided at all for you , or because you 're playing they have n't had the chance to heal yet from the start of tournament today ?
it could be justine again ?
are you able to breathe better now that you 've had the nasal surgery ?
you said you were looking forward to your day off . is there anything that takes your mind off tennis during those nearly 48 hours ?
she played pretty well , did n't she ?
you did n't seem to be on your game tonight . we 've all seen you play a lot better .
any one aspect of your game that did n't work for you , that you were disappointed with ?
how did you feel coming into the match ? were you at all anxious going in ?
do you know what 's wrong with your knee ?
has her game gotten a lot more varied in the last year or so , would you say ?
do you think she 'll win it from here ?
your first experience on center court . how would you sum up the game ?
what was the difference from the first and second set ?
what happened towards the end of the second set when you served for it ? did you get nervous ? did you tighten up ?
can ana win this tournament ?
this has been your best grand slam tournament so far . what do you take from that ?
to have this much success at your age usually leads to good things in tennis . how do you feel about your future ?
you were a little slow to start today .
you were down love-3 in the first set .
it seems like you 're playing well enough , winning and getting out of tight spots .
thinking about all the years coming to this tournament , what do you recall about your first trip here ?
this year you could meet your sister in the final . she 's won many times . how could you beat her this year ?
ana said before she felt it was time to take a bit of revenge possibly after the last two encounters you have had in grand slams . what are your thoughts ?
she also said it will be a mental battle for her . do you feel like you 're such a big-match player , you go into a contest like that with a real edge ?
serena said the other day here she always roots for the younger sibling , so she roots for eli manning . does that mean you root for peyton manning ?
the giants won today .
you do n't know peyton manning is eli 's older brother ?
does it strike you funny that she roots automatically for the younger sibling ?
do you find the wide slice here is more effective on the new surface than in previous years ?
you do n't notice a difference this year versus previous years ?
it stops a little bit ?
on the slice serve .
do you prefer playing with the roof open or closed ?
last year you won wimbledon . you were outside of the top 15 at this time . last year serena won here . she was not even seeded . do you think rankings do not count for you ; you can beat anyone when you want ?
were you surprised last year when serena won here ? she was not even seeded .
did you watch the hewitt match ?
the one that went on after yours .
any empathy for he and marcos to play at such a late hour ?
there 's a story in one of the local papers this morning saying that when you were approached about changing the match , you said that if that happened you would see that as being racist . did you say that ?
no . it said you were believed to say that .
i 'm offering you the chance to say no . did you say it or not ?
being asked to consider putting your match on another court or postponing it in favor of the men 's match , do you see that as a racist issue or sexist ?
you had a wrap on your upper leg . anything serious ?
given four or five years ago , if you had been given the option to go to another court , would the venus of four or five years ago have done that , or is it a mark of standing up for yourself ?
tell us about your match . a slow start but a big finish .
what did you try differently ?
why such good form ? have you done anything special ?
yes .
you 've had some big wins over some very big-name players . do you get nervous before those big matches ?
you seem to have some magic against russian players .
a few years ago when you were thinking about turning pro , did you think you would get to a slam quarterfinal this early in your career ?
do you remember your father used to coach nadia petrova at some stage ?
did it help in this match particularly ?
how well did you know her personally ?
she does n't pat you on the head or anything ?
no time to dry your hair ?
set point down in the second . what happened ?
did it happen that you walked on some sideline today ? i heard that it 's dangerous .
you said on center court that you 're not a morning person . that 's why you went to sleep in the second set .
just as well the finals are at night then .
do you think you are in much better form now than earlier matches ?
i read that you are a columnists like me now . you do writing or by a machine ?
have you thought about what , if you did win a grand slam , what it would mean to you off the court in terms of endorsements , the attention , the profiles ? you look at what happened to maria when she won wimbledon .
name of the great manager ?
over the summer , what particular training did you do to make yourself stronger and tougher for this grand slam ?
is that increased fitness a reason for you being a top 10 player as opposed to a year ago ?
venus williams looks like she will come through . if she is your next opponent . do you think she can beat her ?
i read in the yellow pages here you are very fond the greek mythology . is there some special divinity close to you that you worship especially ?
it 's going to be difficult against venus . she has something big on her side .
your thoughts on caroline 's game out there ?
playing venus , is it more of a mental test than it is a physical and technical one ?
did you feel at the us open that you did not play patiently enough ?
a few years since you 've been to the quarterfinals . how are you feeling ?
the past couple of years , going out in the fourth round , has that been tough to take ?
you fought to come back and get this win .
for the last few years , have you ever thought you would n't get back to this point ?
what 's the difference between you as a tennis player now and five years ago ?
you 've played against radwanska once . what are your thoughts about her ?
apart from the two williams and justine henin , there are five players coming from eastern europe . do you think the reason is because you have more motivation there ? now even poland is producing good players . is it the country where you 're born that pushes you to do your best ?
you 've said you 're calm and relaxed on the court . anything you 've done special to create this ?
the fact that you have to play radwanska instead of kuznetsova , or instead of petrova , does that make you more optimistic about your future in this tournament ?
your best ever performance at a grand slam tournament . how did it feel ?
you had a couple breaks of serve in the first set with a chance of winning that . what went wrong ?
how did you rate venus ' performance today ?
do you think she 's got what it takes at the moment to win this week ?
can we have your thoughts on the match ?
a lot of improvement to come ?
what 's it like playing her ? you 're never quite sure what you 're going to get , right ?
the police in concert next saturday at the melbourne cricket grounds .
yeah .
7:30 ?
sting , andy sommers and stuart copeland .
do you know him personally ?
a hundred bucks ?
yeah , to pay .
how much of last night did you watch ?
you were in bed when hewitt and baghdatis ?
do you agree with venus ' staff threatening to leave the tournament reportedly if her match did n't go ahead ?
you can verify that for us , though , there was absolutely no threat from venus to leave the tournament ?
did you happen to be in that conversation last night ?
do you think there 's a chance you 'll meet your sister here in the final here in australia ?
what do you have to improve from today to get to the final and win ?
i know you have to play whoever you get in the draw , but is it a bit of a relief not to have to play justine in the quarters again because it 's a change of pace , basically ?
who do you hope to meet in the quarterfinals ?
do you feel a lot quicker on the court this year , or is it just our impression ?
he 's 33 .
your sister 's opponent next is going to be a polish player . what do you know about polish tennis ?
there were times in the match when you really were hanging there , seemed like , then got a little bit away from you . what do you think happened and what was the difference ?
how do you compare the way she 's playing and moving , say , to last year when you played her here ? do you remember ?
what do you think it 's going to take to beat her from you ? is it going to take a lot more hard work or is it a mental thing , you think ?
there were times when you were trying to change the pace on her a little bit . used a dropshot three or four times . were you confident just hitting with her , going toe to toe , you would be able ...
what do you think her chances are this year , winning the tournament the way she 's playing ?
was that your best performance , given the opposition ?
you kept a lot of points short , served well , came in , finished off . the plan was there and it just clicked ?
so given that your draw was pretty tough on paper , you 've come through pretty well to the quarters .
against justine , why do n't you just talk about that match . you saw her plenty . you saw her at the championships , australia two years ago , in the us open . so it 's a big , big challenge ?
so is there anything else you can do differently or is it more about execution than anything else ?
the freshness factor probably wo n't be there unless you play three and a half this time because you have n't been as long on court , and quarterfinals ?
justine 's added a new element to her training regime . she 's taking hip-hop lessons ?
do you take those classes ?
singing and dancing ?
she said that it made her feel like she was doing something she was n't naturally good at , sort of putting her in an uncomfortable situation , and that was good for her . is that the way you feel about it , too ?
perhaps the two of you could do a duet for charity ( laughter ) .
what makes it so difficult to play her ? of course , she 's mentally very tough , but is it also the way she mixes up her game , or ...
do you feel like you have to be a lot more patient with her than other players ? do you still have to wait for your chance ?
you were saying after the lindsay match that at the outset of the tournament you saw that and said , yeah , that 's a big challenge for me . is that the same thing with justine ; you see her name there and say , that 's the kind of match i 'm going to get up for ?
how did you feel tonight on court ? you looked incredible .
you had n't been feeling all that well , have you , in previous games ?
you said prematch and you just said again you felt the crowd would be against you . you still had a fair bit of support . crowd seemed generous to you .
you played casey in bali last september . do you see improvement ? what do you make of her game generally ?
second point of the match , she stopped playing , right ? there was a question whether they would replay it ? what happened there ?
it was your choice to replay the point ? he said he could n't .
you said casey went for probably a few too many big shots . did you think she might be quite brave in that way ? did you predict that ?
some stages during the game , your face seemed to have a look of pain . everything okay ? not too many problems there ?
feeling the way you do , does that lower your expectations against serena ?
last year when you played her here , she was not in great form . you almost came in as the favorite . you did n't play your top level . maybe it 's a special motivation to go out against her and show you can play at your best ?
you were saying your body is sore . you 've been saying that for the last nine or ten days . are you going to be able to run as well as you need to against her if it 's a long match ?
what do you think about that ? should you be playing grand slam tennis at 3:30 or 4:00 in the morning ?
where do you rank serena 's serve in the women 's game ?
how do you feel you played today ?
you 've played well in australia . why are you so much a better player than you were one year ago ?
even six months ago .
what do you think about the australian audience ?
the ones watching you .
what was it like playing someone you knew very little about ?
where does she have to improve to continue on ?
where do you feel your level is going into the quarterfinals ?
you 're very likely going to play sharapova . it 's been two months since your final in madrid . talk about that .
you 've beaten a lot of power players . what makes maria so special ?
she had a lot of shoulder problems last year , her serve . in madrid did you find her service speed was back ?
do you think we 'll be seeing more players hitting double from both side ?
what do you think are the advantages and disadvantages of that style ?
what are the disadvantages ? their reach or movement ?
when you see great three-out-of-five-set matches like federer , roddick , hewitt , do you ever say to yourself , i 'd like to do that , three-out-of-five-set women 's final ?
how do you think you came out of that ?
the first half dozen games , you seemed to have a lot of unforced errors . was it nerves or finding your range ?
after the last 36 hours , were you more nervous going out tonight than the previous match ?
how do you feel after everything that 's happened over the last week ?
you said it 's one tournament . it 's important now to follow it up , is n't it ?
do you have any sense how this week can form a foundation for the rest of your career , whether it 's getting into tournaments or financial stuff , anything like that ?
how did that measure tonight , the gap between yourself and the top three ? is that a fair reality check of where you need to get to ?
what is the most important thing you think you need to work on in the immediate future ?
the fair chunk of prize money you 'll take away for the week , any plans for what you 'll do with that ?
have you picked a color yet ?
what is your favorite charity ?
how has nan handled her publicity over the last 36 hours ?
on looking on facebook , i see that you 're a member of the fans of casey dellacqua group . the change in recognition you 've now got , what does that mean to you ?
as a confirmed fan , are you pretty proud of yourself this week ?
you seem in pretty good spirits despite the loss . does the enormity of this week outweigh the disappointment of losing tonight ?
do you know what comes after fed cup ?
what will you take from this tournament that you think you 'll most treasure ?
how would you assess your match tonight ? were you happy with the way you played ?
did she surprise you with the strength of her groundstrokes ?
is it correct that the referee or the scheduling people gave you the option of not playing tonight and holding over to tomorrow ?
what was it like waiting so long for the federer match to be over , and what do you do during that period ?
can you explain the name of your clothing line , how you got that name ?
can you talk about ivanovic . it will be the third slam in a row that you 've played her .
what do you think the difference was the last couple of times ?
so you were kind of scratchy at times tonight , but do you feel going into the meat of the tournament you are where you want to be ?
so you 're saying , too , that if you need to make adjustments you can make the adjustments ?
do you have any pity at all for lleyton and marcos being out there till maybe 3:00 in the morning tonight playing ?
what 's the solution to this sort of thing . seems like it happens a fair bit where people are playing in the middle of the night .
did you catch any of roddick 's match last night ? i imagine you did n't stay up till 2:30 .
but you obviously saw some of federer today .
have you ever thought when you see a great three-out-of-five set match , boy , i 'd like to play a three-out-of-five set match someday ?
was it with serena , three out of five ?
win or loss ?
sharapova last year at the open , and right now you have svetlana kuznetsova on your board . do you think you 've found an ideal surface to beat russian players ?
does that give you confidence , now that you 've played , you 've beaten a big name already , can you come out in a grand slam and do it again ?
did you learn much about her in those previous three matches you played against her ?
do you think you 're playing well enough to keep going through the rounds and get right into a semifinal or in the final if you keep going ?
last year you were still in school at this time .
but are you all done now ?
does it make tennis easier not to have those other responsibilities ?
driving lessons ?
are you driving on the wrong side of the road here ?
so how long is that going to take ? you said you 'd be taking a test right after .
and you talked to us quite a bit last year about your pets .
do you still have those two pets ?
do you feel still like a teenager or a woman ?
where do you feel you came up short tonight ?
what do you take out of the game ?
did the delay affect you at all , getting out on the court after such a big match ?
were you approached about switching and playing at vodafone arena ? were you asked about that ?
was an option to maybe cancel your match so they could get the hewitt match on before too late ?
seems like the serve was the major difference ?
the atmosphere here with all the different groups coming out to support players and the rowdiness , players and fans love it , but it can also have an ugly side . i wondered , on balance , if you see it as a good thing that the atmosphere here is like that ?
has your performance in this championship given you the confidence to perhaps have the best year that you 've had ?
across the country in perth the indian cricket team won against a more highly-ranked opponent . you obviously watched that . did you also draw some sort of motivation from that ?
yeah .
speaking of national teams , when you finish here you 'll be playing fed cup .
how important is it to play for your country , represent your country ?
how much does it hurt , then , when you get accusations like the recent ones . i mean , you 're obviously a proud indian .
do you feel let down by the people who accused you of these things ?
what are your thoughts on that ?
she 's beaten quite a few top players . what is it about her game that 's so difficult ?
were you not feeling okay , or was something wrong ?
you say you were n't thinking right . what were you thinking then ?
is it mental pressure that got to you ?
you handled pressure in grand slams so well before on many occasions . why was that different ?
she played with no pressure whatsoever . she seemed to be a lot more freer than you were . is it just a case of her being young and not having experienced that before , that she was just enjoying the moment , and you were feeling the pressure because she was playing so freely ?
did you feel anything unusual before you got on the court ?
do you think she 's a special young talent ?
we saw you playing a very good final in sydney against justine . how tough is this loss to take ?
the score of the first set says it 's an easy match , but it was n't for you , was it ?
do you see this as a bit of the breakthrough win at a grand slam ?
can you talk about maybe the last six or seven months , why your game has been improving so much , and how you 've gotten to this stage ?
so it 's that you have confidence in what he 's telling you , and then you can bring that to the court ?
were you surprised at how anna fell away in the second two sets ?
gave you a big boost to see she was really struggling ?
are you two good friends ?
yeah .
does that make it hard for you ?
out there on the court when you 're playing somebody you know so well ?
when you were in the juniors and at the club with anna , who won most of those matches ?
do you feel a little bit more calm and patient in the court ? and if so , do you think it 's a matter of growing , or you work on it with your trainer ?
more calm and patient on the court ?
you work with your trainer , or it 's just a matter of you growing and getting more ...
when anna passed you in the rankings the last couple years and she beat you three times in a row coming into this match , did that give you sort of a wakeup call ? did it tell you , i have to do something else with my game now , because now i 'm seeing players i used to beat and they 're going beyond me ?
so now you 're in your first fourth round of a grand slam . can you dream a little bit that maybe you can win a couple more matches and belong with the top players ?
in your opening match you said you panicked a bit , but since then you showed no signs of nervousness . were you feeling comfortable there ?
how important was the crowd ?
does it give you momentum , do you think ?
was that the best you 've played so far this tournament , today ?
are you feeling pretty confident now about the rest of the tournament ?
it 's your first time in the second week here . is that a bit of a milestone for yourself ?
was there anything that you 'd like to improve on , or were you happy with the way everything 's clicked ?
what are your thoughts on that match ? pretty routine ?
served unbelievably well . can you serve much better than that ?
can you bottle that , figure out why it happened ?
she 's an up-and-coming player . seemed to play pretty well off the ground .
are you happy with the way you 're moving at this point in the tournament ?
venus is playing doubles with you . it 's like playing with herself . is that the same for you ?
who decides tactics ?
what does it say to the teams that are out there that you knocked off the no.2 seed ?
so it 's not a coincidence you 're playing doubles again in an olympic year ?
was that one of the most exciting titles you won , that olympic gold ?
your earrings , are they officially large when you can fit a tennis ball through them ?
are you still working on the althea gibson documentary ?
how would you compare vaidisova to azarenka ? many nuances between them ?
how would you assess your performance today ?
the age you are now , do you feel much different to how you did two or three years ago , being a little older , a little bit more experienced ?
you served with a great deal of strength today . is that something you 've been working on in the off-season ?
can you talk about possibly playing serena , who you played here last year in the semis .
what do you have to do differently against her ?
do you feel you 're moving better than you did last year ?
you play the game with quite a lot of emotion . serena is a player that can sometimes get under her opponent 's skin . she can be quite intimidating . how do you deal with that ?
what do you think you need to be like when you play her ? keep it in check or just be yourself ?
you say you ca n't be something you 're not . is mental strength something you 've been trying to work on ?
have you ever spoken to a sports psychologist ?
would you ever ?
what are the parts of your game that you think will worry serena ?
do you consider her to be an intimidating player ?
yes i have .
a lot of players will say , i have to focus on my side of the net , not notice who is on the other side . when it 's someone like serena , got to be pretty difficult .
what 's changed from then to now ? are you a different player ? do you have a different mindset now ?
your third straight-sets win in a row . what are your thoughts on today 's match ?
any aspect of your game that you 're really happy with ?
she 's just not quite as consistent as you are , huh ?
you know dementieva really well , your next opponent . she had a quick win today in a match that could have gone long against peer . should be a tough matchup .
your father does n't wear the hoodie anymore . is he feeling better ?
if nike would pay me enough money , i would do it .
the first week has pretty much passed for you now . tough second-round matchup . going into next week , looking ahead , it will get pretty rough . the draw is n't that easy .
considering how much you focused on trying to get ready to beat lindsay , do you feel you had any sort of hangover from that at the beginning of the match today , being able to get focused and into it ?
in the past sometimes they said equal prize money was not fair because women were winning too easily .
in these days it 's happened that the top eight players have won all their matches very easily . i mean , there were seven 6-loves and there were only two men two sets love .
the professor would like to know if now you believe women should be paid more than men ?
are you intending to come with the russian team in the fed cup to israel ?
for sure ?
the israeli crowd is expecting you very much .
you know dementieva beat the two israelis pretty easily .
what do you think about your chances ?
today jankovic got a warning because her mother apparently was coaching her . she said it was n't true , so on . do you remember when your father had the warning for the same reason , or if he ever had ?
do you remember when was the last time ?
maybe so .
i 'll tell you later .
it was against camille pin . very hot conditions .
was today the first time you got a time code warning ?
is consistency the key now to you for better performance ?
it seemed to be the umpire 's decision about your mother seemed to fire you up , focus you . were you very angry at that point ?
what was your view of the umpire 's decision ?
how big a concern is it for you that you 've had two hard matches ?
you said you were tired . have you got enough energy level for the second week of the tournament ?
how would you describe your level of fitness at the moment ?
has she ever been accused of coaching before ?
does she want a slice of the coaching fee ?
your interaction with your mother , you 're smiling and laughing . do you feel you may have to curb a bit of that if umpires are not going to like it ?
is there anybody you can talk to , officials , to sort this out ?
can you talk to someone of a higher authority ?
you were late to have a shower .
yes .
mauresmo is your next opponent . if you play like you did today , do you think you can beat her ?
do you think about defending points , wta points ?
a tougher match than the previous two as we get further into the draw .
a question about svetlana . it 's hard sometimes to have friendships when you 're at the top , but it seems you are great mates . can you talk about your friendship with her , what you admire about her off the court .
she says you put up with her hip hop music .
you 're taking hip hop lessons ?
are we going to see you bust out some dance moves after a match ?
is a winning streak anything that 's in the front of your head ?
you also used to share the spotlight with kim in your country until a year ago . does it feel different not having her around ?
do you see her at all ?
who do you see as your toughest opponent on the tour right now ?
what 's it like to be australia 's no.1 woman tennis player ?
was there something pretournament you had your eyes on before the tournament ?
take us through what that actually means to you ?
what about at 3-1 in that last set ?
do you think you wanted to work on your victory wave a little bit ?
you played jelena in bali last year and you had 4-love in the first set . you must go in with a fair bit of confidence knowing she 's not playing her best either .
like amlie , do you feel she might be a bit vulnerable ? injury problems , that sort of stuff .
with jelena , too , do you feel the same sort of feeling with her ?
you 've had a little bit of time now . what 's the overriding emotion for you right now late on friday night ? what are you feeling ?
have you managed to speak to the family ? they 're sort of shoehorned into the supporters ' box in there .
what 's the plan now for the next two days ? you put yourself under wraps today , had an early training session , and then did n't really reappear until 6:00. what is the theory for the next couple of days ?
do you have to pop into the nike store again ?
prematch , was there anything in mauresmo 's game that you wanted to concentrate on where you thought you might be able to get the edge ?
that last change of ends of the match , when you came back on the court , the crowd behind you , the weight of the expectation , does that almost get too much at that stage ? you come to the big game , the crowd , 15,000 behind you , how do you cope with that ?
did you just find that out tonight , though ? some players can cringe under that kind of spotlight , and others enjoy it . you seemed to enjoy it tonight . did you know you were going to react like that ?
does that also make you feel that tonight is the start of something , wherever that leads , as opposed to sort of the end of a journey for you ?
you how does it sit with you now to be carrying the hopes of your nation ?
does it change how you see yourself as a player , what you believe you can achieve ?
does this success you 're having now make you feel better as a person , you worked so hard for it , now you 're getting the benefits ?
do you sense in the last stages of the match that you might have had a bit of a mental edge ? she was throwing in a few double-faults and seemed a little bit nervous . did you feel you were getting on top ?
what 's jelena 's weakness ?
looked like a tough match on the score board . how did you assess it ?
a few unforced errors ?
why was that ?
is that the sort of game you need to bring you to your top , progress further in the championship ?
you play mirza in the next round . what you do you know of her ? have you played her before ?
venus , there was a lot of breaks of serve in the match . were you concerned about your serving ?
that kind of match is a good test for you , do n't you think , because she makes you play a lot of different shots , you use different parts of your arsenal ?
you 've been coming in a lot , which happened last couple years . looks like you 're much more comfortable at net than you were , say , a decade ago ?
practicing against hard hitters all the time when you play . against camille , she has a soft serve . must be hard to get used to that .
she gave sharapova a hard time last year . i do n't know if you saw that match . why does she give people a difficult time ?
i do n't know if you talked about this on day 1 , but can you talk about what happened towards the end of last year when you were forced to pull out of the championships and you were get getting those dizzy spells . what did the doctors actually say ?
but is it something that is going to continue to affect you , or was it just a one off or ...
you do n't want to say directly ? because there was some reports out there that it might have been anemia .
venus , i 'm doing a little feature on mark hlawaty . can you express a couple of words on what he means and how he fits in ?
what 's making his hair great ?
fashion things aside , he 's pretty handy as a hitting partner , as well . how important is he to you girls ?
venus , i saw your sister 's blog yesterday and she said she read 'who moved my cheese ' . do you read books like that or did she try to get you to read it ?
there are n't too many big hard court titles that have eluded you in your career , if any . do you bring that kind of awareness into a tournament like this ?
how do you feel about television commentators making comments about your rear-end ? i mean , not in a negative way .
you have a doubles match coming up in a little while . how important is that in the scheme of things ? are you trying to win in the doubles ?
when you came on the circuit a decade ago , you were only surrounded by your family , your sister . you did n't have too many friends in the circuit . how this has changed in the last 10 years ? do you have other people you like to see outside of the tennis court , even if they are tennis players , or you never see them ?
in the locker rooms , they 're more friendly or let 's say people you have lunch together here if you have a chance or not ?
you got off to a great start and then the match tightened up . how do you assess the game , from your point of view ?
did she improve a great deal in those second two sets or did you drop off a little ?
seemed like you were playing a little bit conservative in that third set ?
it 's a different position for you now the last couple of slams where you 're going in seeded as a favorite mentally because you 're actually expected to be winning those matches ?
do you approach the next match in any different way ?
venus said she expected you to be very aggressive . she said you 're an aggressive type of player .
you must be very encouraged the way you started this season .
this is sort of a long time since you played her . it was 2005. can you bring something else to the table now because she 's not only powerful , venus , but she 's fast . her defensive game is good . the offense is there .
do you have to establish your forehand against her ? like today , your opponent was playing your backhand , backhand , backhand , and you were consistent enough . against venus , if you do n't have the big weapon , it might be a little more problematic .
you were talking the other day about trying to maintain focus because of everything happening , and you did a decent job last couple days . if you go out on a big court against venus , that 's pretty critical , too . you have to put everything behind you ?
how do you explain the first set ?
a lot of the players say that early in the championship it 's hard to get your rhythm . was that something you found difficult to do today ?
you got it all together in the second set . that must have pleased you .
do you find it useful to get advice from former champions ?
how do you feel about that match ?
how important to get through in pretty quick time ?
i think you played much better than the first game . do you agree with that ?
what do you think of your next opponent ?
do you think she will try to get something out of her coach that can help her ?
you must be satisfied with that .
talk about the match a little bit .
what were the conditions like out there ? it seemed like it was pretty breezy .
you also play doubles in the tournament . do you take it as the preparation for the big game ? and also , do you feel you are a favorite to win the doubles in olympics no matter how low you 're ranked in the doubles ?
another question about doubles . i 'm wondering , because you two are very strong in the singles and know so well each other , do you actually play as a team for doubles , or do you go to the court to play doubles ?
when you look back at least year at the grand slams , obviously you were great here , you performed well , you did well in miami . but at the french open would it be fair to say you played a poor match against justine , and then at wimbledon you had the thumb ? was the knee bothering you in the us open ? was it sort of disappointing the way it sort of went after a promising start of the year ?
how did you get over it ? end of the year was a struggle too in madrid .
do you think that your game was particularly suited for playing someone like yuan ? she did n't have a whole lot of offense , but she hit the ball hard and sort of played right into your strengths .
have you looked ahead to your next matchup ?
have you thought about sort of how much tougher it 's going to get from here on ?
you had some pretty good support out there . does that really get you psyched up during the match ?
how much of a difference does it make , just the whole feeling of the tournament , when venus is on the other half ?
how much do you coach each other in practice ? do you say things to her and she says things to you that will help you ?
are you looking forward to getting back on the court with venus ? you have n't played together for quite a while .
given me your relationship with your sister , have you got any comment about the behavior of an australian tv tennis commentator last night who slow-mo 'd action of venus ' posterior on television and told a national viewing audience that he thought it looked pretty good ?
her butt .
do you feel at all like last year here ?
how many doubts would you have had at this stage in the event last year as compared to this year ?
giants or packers ?
what about patriots/chargers ?
and then ?
are you going to be watching the games ?
you seemed to be kind of frustrated or anxious to get the game moving or finished today . is that correct ?
do you see this as a big year for you ?
do you have goals , or just play it tournament by tournament ?
in hindsight , now that you 've actually beaten lindsay , probably quite good to have such a tough opponent so early ?
what pleased you most about your performance tonight ?
lindsay said she thought your serve had improved .
has it ? have you worked on it specifically ?
you 've thought about this matchup for a while . was it harder or easier than you expected tonight ?
did you think you would get it done as well as you ?
if there 's one benefit to all the time you spent off the court last year it might have been the training , because it seems like you 're moving particularly well . you 're get to go a lot of balls now .
is there a chance that it could be a letdown , your next match ? you built up for this one .
how were you able to spend that time when you were n't playing last year ?
did you buy your dad his hoodie ?
he looks intimidating .
what did you buy for the houses that you put into it ?
did you consider consulting v starr interiors to help you out ?
v starr interiors , venus ' interior decorating company ?
did you buy original artwork or buy prints , or what did you get ?
how did you like your designing ? did you design the way you really wanted to ?
let 's go back to the match for a second . i think it 's fair to say that occasionally in the ladies ' game first week of grand slam can be a bit of a breeze for the top players , even though you say you took every match seriously . is it therefore good , do you think , in the overall aspect of the event to have a match like this soon in the championship and get everything going and everything moving the way you want it to be ?
did you really expect her to bring her slam-winning form , or can you not afford to think about that ?
did you really expect lindsay to bring her former no.1 form when she was playing you tough and you were coming up and she was at the top , or do you say to yourself , i ca n't afford to think that she 's only been back for a few months and she might not be able to bring her top form .
cruised through the first se 6-0. she broke you to go 5-5 in the second . the crowd erupted . must have been tough to get back your focus .
next up you 've got dementieva . you 've played each other three times . she 's 2-1 against you . what were your thoughts going into the match ?
has her game changed slightly since she 's changed her serve , elena 's ? she 's changed her serve . she throws the ball over her head more and it 's more of a kicking serve .
what changed between monday and today ?
do you think a loud australian crowd actually makes you play better , when they 're supporting the australian as opposed to the israeli ? do you think if your back gets against the wall you fight harder ?
you seemed annoyed a couple times when she hit the ball back at you . what did you say to her in the end ?
just a question on doha . they banned -- it 's illegal for israeli citizens to go there and you 're going to have the opportunity .
yeah . they banned israeli citizens .
you 're going to have the opportunity to do that . i know you said that you 're going just to play tennis , but do you think maybe it 's something that you would cherish as very few people that have the opportunity are going to do ?
( speaking in hebrew . )
is it added pressure being the last israeli left in the main draw now that dudi is out ?
well-fought out . how big a step up in quality was shahar than your first opponent ?
what did you tell yourself at the end of have first very quick set ?
you really brought the crowd into it when you won your first service game in the second . you got a huge cheer .
how tough was it with the opponent and the conditions out there ?
what sort of mindset did casey 's win put you in before the game ?
does it give you a good mindset for tomorrow 's doubles , as well ? you 're teaming up with one of your good friends . does it give you that sort of boost that she 's doing so well , as well ?
does it give you hunger now , knowing that you were sort of close in that second set against a pretty good player ?
do you have plans for the rest of the year ? do you know where you go from here ?
casey said earlier she 'd use her prize money to buy new shirts . will you do that same thing ?
are you still playing the juniors next week ?
good preparation for the juniors then ?
how do you feel about that ?
are you happy with your own serve ?
could you be optimistic about the rest of the year , just on one performance , bad performance ?
you said something about your second serve . you 've got a big kick serve . is that something you 've noticed the entire summer ?
where do you think your game 's at overall ? what does this match tell you about where your game is at ?
where are you percentage-wise compared to where you were three years ago ? 75 percent ? 80 percent ?
the crowd behind you is dominating the headlines again . is that hurting the open 's reputation internationally , and do you think against the tennis community ?
are you proud of your polish roots ?
you talk about how good the girls are . do you feel the time you were off the tour they 've leapt ahead and you 're kind of trying to play catch up ?
does that in some way make it easier , learning how to play one or how to play all ?
what are your thoughts on nicole pratt 's retirement announcement ?
did you have an inkling she was finishing up ? is that why you went out ?
is this one of the most disappointing losses for a long time ? you set yourself for a big summer and just to go out so early .
do you feel like it 's a do-or-die year for you ?
so you definitely would be looking to continue for as long as you feel your tennis is at this level ?
second match you still could n't find your rhythm . was it wind problem today ?
what was the problem ? you called in the trainer .
razzano , the next opponent , what do you think ?
what do you think of the romanian girl ?
do you feel better now ?
looks like injury in perth is gone now completely ?
what were you complaining to the referee ? what was the problem ? we could n't hear it .
good luck with the next match .
was that second set a wakeup call ?
is it always a problem , motivation a problem in your game ?
what do you make of the incident last night with the capsicum spray and the police ?
so it does n't dent your view of the tournament ?
larry scott talked the other day a little bit about provisional suspensions with doping , so between the first sample and the second sample , instead of waiting until the b sample comes back instead of announcing provisional suspensions earlier . i 'm wondering if you feel like the way the doping protocol is set it takes too long between when a player tests and they 're notified ?
for instance , if martina hingis , she tested in july and she found out in september it came out . it 's a long time .
do you feel a player should be suspended before their side 's been heard ?
we all know that wimbledon is very important to you , but could you talk about the significance of this slam for you , given the fact you were gone last year and the year before you had to retire ?
how much did you watch last year , if any , of this tournament ?
nothing ?
was it deliberate ? did you feel you would miss it too much if you watched ?
well , how are you feeling ?
what was it about your game today that you felt allowed you to win from matches in the past ?
you were very aggressive in that last game . players can normally sort of push you around and you just try and hope for an error ?
you played like you have more belief in yourself it seems .
have you had a bigger win than that one ?
would you have had the legs to run two 8-6 in the third sets out in the past ?
is that the main difference from 2006 to 2008 ?
what 's your ambition in tennis ?
going back throughout memory banks , was it this time last year that you talked about having to go to a department store and get yourself kitted out ahead of the aussie open last year ?
it 's been a different approach and not a target approach this year , it 's actually been a nike approach ?
having to do your own washing , as well ?
getting through the third round provides some realistic dollars . is that going to change those sort of things ?
is that part of the driving ambition of being able to get out and enjoy those luxuries ?
what about taking on amlie mauresmo in the third round ? it 's a real possibility .
how many outfits did you pick up yesterday , one or two or a different number of them ?
just to be clear , did nike hook you up with the gear this time , or did you just buy it ?
what about the pepper spray incident last night ? what do you make of that ?
with the pepper spray being used at the chilean versus the greek guy .
three people were thrown out . yeah , police used pepper spray to control the crowd .
i notice you 've got v8 supercars down as one of your favorite sports . there would n't be too many women on tour that would put that on the list .
you have enough money to buy a new car from the third round here , wo n't you ?
just on a different note , were you surprised by nicole pratt 's announcement ? what did you hear about that ?
is she an example you could follow on how to dedicate and commit yourself , do you think , to the sport ?
she said last night that there was a real opportunity now for an australian woman to step up . is that the way you girls are thinking ?
can you imagine getting paid to wear free clothes as opposed to people giving them to you ? can you imagine if sharapova gets millions and millions of dollars to wear free clothes , is that something you 've thought about ?
how did that come about ? nike just called you after the first round or ...
you were saying your family 's over , or your dad is going to lug your stuff home .
do you have tickets for them all , or is that a struggle ?
what did you think of the first set ?
do you see this as a measuring stick for how far you still have to go to get back to the very top ?
what 's missing in particular ?
how does it feel to be back on a really big court ? first round you said you battled a bit of butterflies . were you more calm this time going on the court ?
it was n't nerves ?
you said you 're not sure if you 're aiming to get back right to the very top of women 's tennis . where exactly are you trying to go with this comeback ? do you have sort of a stated goal , anywhere you 'd like to get to , top 10 , top 5 ?
does your day job put into context tonight 's defeat ?
as in being a mother .
you had n't played her in almost two years . could you notice how much better she 's moving , in particular ?
why are you still playing , lindsay ? is it love of the game or something still to prove ?
what about being the highest paid sportswoman ? what do you make of that ?
do you get any encouragement from other moms walking down the street or as you walk around the area here ? do they yell things out to you that otherwise you would n't have heard before ?
is there any other female athletes who have been through a similar thing that you 've spoken to and gotten encouragement from ?
what 's been the most difficult aspect of coming back and trying to balance motherhood and tennis ?
serena said she could n't imagine what it was like walking around pregnant , let alone playing tennis having a baby . how hard is it ?
on the physical challenge you were talking about , do you feel like you 've lost half a step or do you feel you need to gain a step back or are you just getting tired ?
stroke-wise it did n't seem like it took you that long to get your rhythm back , though .
what 's your next tournament ?
i know you have n't faced justine for a while . but after facing sharapova tonight , and you know both of them pretty well . if she plays at that level , would you give her a shot in the quarters ?
how did you assess your opening match ?
plenty of room for improvement as the tournament goes on ?
there were some errors in the game . to be expected ?
you walked out there with your own line of clothing . how satisfying is that to walk out with clothes you designed yourself ?
what about your jewelry , is that your design as well ?
that 's not an engagement ring on your finger ?
you missed the tournament last year . this is one you have n't won . serena did well last year . do you come in here with your sights set for some unfinished business ?
serena mentioned you were playing really well during practice . do you feel like you are , that you 're coming into this in really good form ?
the thing in madrid that kept you out , what exactly was that ? how are you feeling now ?
you 're a hundred percent physically ?
we always hear wonderful words by serena to you and you to serena . when you are both in the house , what do you say terrible to serena that she becomes angry ?
never ?
for nothing ?
c'mon .
your first time here in australia as the world no.2 . is that a tag you 're getting used to ?
are you happy to be fairly anonymous ? a lot of the players have higher profiles than you who are not ranked as high . not as much attention .
do you feel you get enough credit for the player that you are , especially right now at your career-high ranking ? and do you care about that ?
what about back home ?
there are so many great players from your country now . do you feel you get lost in the shuffle ?
what did you think of your performance today ?
do you feel like you 're in the easier part of the draw ?
you 're very popular with your fellow players . is that important to you ? is that a good thing ?
you 've been called the biggest character in the locker room .
who would you say your closest friend is on the tour ?
we also understand that you dictate the music in the locker room .
does she ever say yes ?
is there a favorite style of music you play before a big match ?
favorite artists ?
do you feel like you 're playing your best tennis at the moment ?
what do you think can take you to the next level ? you played in the sydney final , lost to justine . you 're world no.2 . what is it going to take for you to step up and start winning those kinds of matches , perhaps be no.1 ?
is fed cup going to be a big priority for you again this year ?
7-5 , 6-3. easy win , but was n't that easy on the court .
second set was close .
are you happy with your performance today ?
who do you prefer in the next round ?
how good are you prepared for this grand slam ?
you use this racquet before , or is the first time ?
what is the difference in the racquet from the one you had before ?
are you using the same strings ?
you had a tough match , and yet novak djokovic said today you can say the top 5 or top 10 players are going to get through easy like in the women 's draw .
so you have to blame novak for saying it ?
has novak ever tried to copy you and your moves on court ?
what is the latest gossip ?
because you blame us for being too late with the gossip .
how much pressure have you put on yourself for the next two weeks ?
does it feel like what happened in the first set , that was the case , you maybe put too much pressure on yourself ?
how do you keep yourself focused when you 're not at melbourne park ?
summarize that game for us . it was a good one first up ?
very tight .
what is your goal for this year ?
fully fit ?
so how does it feel to be back ? what did you think of your level ?
so level-wise ? little bit scratchy ?
why do you play well here in australia ?
yes .
do you think the surface is appreciably different this year ? is it quicker ?
the ball speed feels the same ? the bounce does n't feel higher or lower ?
what do you think of the color of the court ?
any special memories when you first walked out , like last year 's final ?
a bit of a scare in that first set when you went over on your ankle .
what did you make of your opponent today ?
i was reading through your much publicized blog today .
let me ask you about the second one . you were talking about change . does that apply on court , too ? are there things you 're thinking you were afraid to change on court ?
is there a next stage on court for you ? are there new elements you feel you should be adding ?
you were asked the other day about lindsay , her comeback . do you expect we 'll see more women coming on the tour that have had babies ?
did you correspond with her via email when she was pregnant ? are you surprised she did come back ?
you lost a lot of weight and you look great . what is your secret ?
there 's been speculation that the aussie open may rotate around the asia/pacific countries , as in china might host the first grand slam , or japan , then australia . what are your thoughts ? should it stay here ?
back to the blog . i 'm going to ask you about the other one . do you feel comfortable baring your soul to the world when you 're writing , knowing everyone is going to ask about it , who the guy was , how i felt about it ?
it was basically that you 're baring your soul .
what 's the no.1 thing not to do ?
seeing as some of your friends misinterpreted your state of mind , what you were saying when you were writing on the blog , does it give you a different perspective if someone writes something about you in the media and it does n't come across the right way to you ?
is that pretty much the overriding theme of your life , or one of them ?
they were ?
where ?
do you feel you can play your best when you feel like you do n't have something to prove ?
i was reading some comments from hopman cup . one could have been tongue and cheek . you said , i want no.1 again , and justine , be warned .
well , i want to be no.1 , that certainly sounds like you .
you pushed the bar really high in your dominant stage . do you feel justine pushed the bar higher last year ?
how do you assess your form today as a first-round match ?
how do you compare your form now with this time last year when you made the final ?
how much is this week about getting the business done , getting into the next week ?
do you have a different mindset week one to week two ?
how many months have you been completely physically healthy and what 's the prognosis now ?
the constant worry you were having last year week to week about the shoulder , that 's pretty much gone away ?
lindsay is not your typical first-week opponent . can you comment on how you see that shaping up ?
is that what worked for you ? you have a good record against her .
when you saw the draw , did you say , ouch , how come i 'm the unlucky one getting her ? there 's not too many floaters who were grand slam champs in the draw .
lindsay spoke about being more aggressive when she plays you . is that the way you 'll approach that match as well ?
lindsay was mentioning getting woken up early in the morning by the baby crying . could you imagine going about the career , getting woken up at 5 a.m. , dealing with the baby , going back to sleep ?
so when you walked onto the grounds after asia , thinking about last year ...
were you pretending you were here for the first time ?
looking ahead , what were you thinking about this tournament , what you felt like you could do , what you wanted to do ?
did that match against justine at the championships help you turn the corner ?
was this your biggest moment ?
you must have gone in thinking it was a winnable one , that it was not the worst draw you could have had ?
not like every other match when you 're coming out in your home slam ?
where 's your game gone just in 12 months ago to now ? where are the differences in your game ?
working on any particular strokes ?
is this your best surface , hard courts ?
how does this compare to your court back home in wiliiams ?
you had such a good start . that must have been important , given you confidence , take away the nerves a little .
how do you feel about what you can achieve these couple of weeks ?
how many family members and friends here ?
australia is impatient for another good woman player to emerge . what 's your progress been like compared with how you would like it to be ?
so have you come along as quickly as you 'd like to or expected to ?
second , third or fourth round here , does it change your scheduling at all ?
in terms of your performance , do you feel more comfortable playing here because there are a lot of australians in the crowd ? does that help you settle the nerves and that sort of thing ?
do you know who you got next or is it yet to be played ?
good to get through a tough one ?
would have been very tempting to panic in that sort of situation , starting , you know , a bit sluggishly , but you did n't . any reason particularly for that , any sort of reason you feel you were in control of the situation ?
did you feel yourself that you lifted sort of midway through that second set ? you seemed to play with a bit more purpose during that period . you had a string there of about 14 points in a row .
yeah .
is that something nicole has asked you to do or is it something you worked out ?
casting ahead , how do you feel going in now , next opponent ?
coming into the tournament , knowing where you 've been , where you 're coming from , did you sort of set a goal for yourself as to how far you expected would be a pass mark for you ?
what about for the year ahead ? do you have any sort of goals set as to what you want to do for the year ?
you trained with other sports people . is that part of the reason why you have good relationships with others , see what price they put on it ?
what do you do tomorrow ?
you came through , but you did it in a very hard way . how did you do it ?
you had a thigh injury going into the tournament . physically , were you okay today ?
have you ever had a more dramatic match than that ?
tamira was obviously feeling lousy after missing three match points . but for people that have n't been in that situation , how hard is it to win that last point ?
for anyone .
do you think having such a long match first up , does that affect your chances in the tournament ?
would you have been able to do that one year ago ?
you beat tamira last year in rome . what do you think about her development ? she still is a teenager . her movement got much better , right ?
there were a lot of breaks of serve particularly in that last set . was there any reason for the poor serving ?
the coach , is he coaching you too ?
when you 're in this situation , do you say to yourself , my god , when is it going to end ?
where are you staying ? are you staying in the city ?
maybe it 's destiny you 're going to be a formula one driver in the future .
six years , through to the second round . emotions must be high .
any thoughts of 2006 when you played lindsay on rod laver ?
so what is the overriding emotion then ?
yes .
groundstrokes seemed to come and loosen up a little through that second set . did you start to feel a bit more confident from then on ?
bottom end ?
because it was so tough in that last set , did you feel yourself tightening up given what 's happened in the past here ?
third set , you would break her , then drop your own serve . you served twice for the match . how much can your game improve ? where are we at with your game ?
patty schnyder .
been a lot of questions on australian women 's tennis . jessica moore after winning today said she 's ready to bring a bit of respect back to it . after the win , do you feel that as well ?
are you going to watch alicia tonight ?
are the australian girls far off the top seeds ?
in getting back in the upper echelon .
you have quarterfinals at hobart , second round here . you probably will get your career high singles ranking . will that change your schedule a bit this year ?
you look exhausted . is it for the match or what you have done after the match ?
you said it was a tough match . did n't look tough from the stands , let 's say .
( from italian ) what did you tell alize after the end of the match ?
she was crying , but a few minutes later you were crying also . you had some champagne in your eyes ?
how bad was the pain when you called the trainer ?
the neck ?
( from italian ) if you had woken up today with pain in your calf , what would you have done ?
did you at any point today think that you might have to retire ?
you had in rome your resurrection a few years ago , and then last year you won it . what it means this year ? are you going to roland garros thinking about yourself as a favorite since henin is not there anymore , or not ?
few weeks ago your mother told me that strasbourg was one of your favorite tournaments , but you 're not going to play this year . what are you going to do next week ?
( from italian ) in tennis there are players who retire and players who lose and playing players like you who win the same tournament two years in a row . what are your objectives and your aim for the end-of-the-year ranking ?
( from italian ) does your victory here mean even more knowing that djokovic won last week ?
( from italian ) there have been comments in a magazine that came out in april commenting about your victory last year and saying how everyone in rome wanted you to win again . lea pericoli , the former italian champion , as you know , commented that both you and djokovic are an example because you 're not spoiled and very serious , calm , and professional , and that 's why she and all the roman public wanted you to win and were happy that both of you won here again . what do you think about those comments ? does to make you happy ?
( from italian ) cornet said she would have liked to have met you in the final because you 're a fair and very good player .
( from italian ) are you happy that you met jelena jankovic in the final ? you said a few days ago when the lady asked you whether you could pick a player to play in the final , and you said jelena would have been a good opponent .
do you ever cry when you lose , or today was exceptional ?
( from italian ) was it just that you were tired , or were you maybe a little bit tense and nervous as well ?
( from italian ) what are you plans ? are you going back to nice , or will you do something else ?
( from italian ) you came out of the qualifying tournament into the main draw . if anyone had told you that you would reach the final , would you think they were crazy ?
( from italian ) how are you arriving in paris since it 's your home tournament ? do you think you 're one of the favorites maybe ?
( from italian ) what will your ranking be from tomorrow ?
( from italian ) when you arrive to french open ?
yes .
i read in l'equipe that you 've had the same coach for ten years ; is that right ?
he said to l'equipe that you already have a good mental outlook . all you need to work on is the strokes and the physical .
what did he say to you today ?
will you buy a present for you to celebrate , to remember this week ?
when did you know that sharapova was n't going to play ?
what was your reaction ?
( from italian ) what about your preparation for tomorrow 's match apart from your training today ?
( from italian ) are you planning on training tomorrow before the match ?
is this the first time in your career that you reach the final without playing in the semis ?
which player do you prefer to play in the final : the young french one or the more experienced russian ?
are you going to watch it on nole ?
at three nil down in the second set you looked completely out of it . how did you turn it around and get back into the game ?
on the television i heard you say that you said something about you being unstoppable now .
( from italian ) do you already have an idea of your tactics for tomorrow ?
this is your tournament or this is your year ?
( from italian ) rome is a city that really favors you . you won itf tournament here , right ?
( from italian ) so we just to have hope that the result of this tournament is different from the result that you obtained playing the itf tournament ?
two years ago it was against who ? a serbian ?
who are some of the champions who have inspired you as you 've been growing up in tennis ?
how do you spend your money ?
driving license ?
how come you think the match ended the way it did ?
you had some problems with your shoulder yesterday . you 're okay now ?
we did n't have the first semis because maria withdraw . did you have any thoughts maybe with your physics maybe not to play today ?
are you satisfied that you reached semis this tournament ?
( from italian ) have you ever seen a match where there were two sides to the match ? for example , in the first set it seemed as though the light was bother you and you had some problems , whereas later on the match --
( from italian . ) later on the match completely changed and it became a whole different story .
yes .
( from italian ) just because it 's a night match and it seemed as though the lights in the stadium were bothering you .
with regard to the second part , the match completely change and turned in your favor later ?
you made many mistakes with your serve today . what do you think is the reason ? and would you tell us with such a game who do you think will win tomorrow 's match against jankovic ? because today she played very good .
do you consider the match against jankovic the real final of this tournament ?
what did your coach say to you after the second set ?
in the beginning of the third set did you have a feeling that she was tired ?
this afternoon you play against venus , and tomorrow probably sharapova . do you think there is too much difference between two parts of the draw ?
( from italian ) what do you think you did technically that made you beat venus today ?
how much are you surprised about the serena retirement ?
do you feel that italian public wanted you to win ? there was many applause when win a point .
( from italian ) does it feel like a fairytale , like a dream ?
what do you think about your next opponent ?
( from italian ) you are the revaluation of this tournament . can you tell us a little bit about yourself so that we get to know you better ?
( from italian ) have you had time to go around rome and see a little bit of rome ?
( from italian ) if you reach the final who would you like your opponent to be ?
sharapova .
you 're french and you like to play on clay , so i think for you roland garros is very important . this tournament it 's a great training for you ?
what do you think about your next opponent , alize ? serena withdraw , and she got to the semis without any problems . had you seen her game against svetlana ? if not , maybe do you have any plans how to play her ?
( from italian ) what happened in the first part of the second set ?
what do you think was the problem with ivanovic ? tsvetana showed the same game today . how do you think why she defeated her ?
there are so many ways to find out the form . this is one of the ways , just to start a little bit slowly and then to find out , or you have some problems with your forehand or something ?
( from italian ) you 're a public figure and everybody loves you . you have lots of fans . your public wants to know if in your life you have room for your private life as well , perhaps a boyfriend , or whether you usually prefer to keep this a secret and private ?
when you play someone like wozniacki , can you remember when you were 17 and which sort of feeling do you have ? i do n't think you can feel old , but in some way do you feel old ?
looking ahead to the french open , what do you expect from the williams sisters ? i always find that a little tough to judge where they 're at . what are your thoughts ?
bye-bye no.1 in the world now . if you have to pick just one opponent , do you pick serena an ivanovic ? one opponent of yours , like no.1 in the world you are today . so is it serena or someone else , like first opponent ? the best opponent of you . do you think it 's serena or ivanovic ?
( from italian ) you always play seems like with extraordinary intensity , and it 's very exciting to watch you . were you always so involved since you were a child , or was there a moment in your career , perhaps when you were training in bradenton , in florida , where you said , from today i 'm going to be more aggressive and more emotionally involved ?
which is your favorite color , because we see you in so many -- you change so much . do you have a favorite color , or no ?
it reflects your personality in some way ?
with justine 's retirement , how wide open is the field for roland garros this year ? how many players have a legitimate shot at winning the title ?
good second match for you ?
did you expect such an easy match today ?
we saw you have some problems in the match against pennetta . how are you feeling now ?
so now you 're focus again to win again this title ?
were you surprised with upset of ivanovic ?
a curious question about the color of your fingernails . you change every match , it 's true ?
today you have beaten kuznetsova , which is the strongest one in your career . what do you think ? how do you feel ?
are you ready to play the former no.1 in the world tomorrow , serena williams ?
you were leading 4-3 in the second . what happened ? you became nervous or something ?
at that point , did you feel any fear to lose the match ?
if you are playing very good tournament , what 's the reason ? do you think it 's physical , mental ?
do you have chance to visit rome in these days or in the past ?
were you annoyed about the fact you have to play on night with the wetness , slow court ?
( from italian ) first of all , we 're very happy that you won here in rome , because it 's important for tennis that you win tonight . it 's important for tennis .
secondly , try and put yourself in justine henin 's shoes and tell us why you might not like tennis and decide to retire from tennis .
what 's it going to feel like next week , no matter what happens at this point , should you take over the no.1 ranking ? i mean , will it be a kind of a strange feeling with the fact that she 's retired and you kind of inherited this ?
once you said that you did n't see yourself still playing at 30 years old or so .
so that means you understand very well what justine has done and you could do it also ?
( from italian ) first of all , i 'm sorry about what i witnessed on the court today . this happens in nadal 's matches a lot as well . the crowd sometimes cheers for your opponent even though it 's an unknown player , perhaps because of envy or jealousy or perhaps because you seem unapproachable . what do you think about this ? does it affect you ?
why do you have so many problems to keep your game service tonight ?
is your wrist a problem ? i saw you that you were touching yourself .
how was the start ?
you spent saturday and sunday in hospital ?
could we have your opinion about henin retires ?
do you think she could be annoyed by tennis , or there is a time when a player could be annoyed ?
( from italian ) your serbian colleague lost today . this maybe will upset the draw a little bit . how do you think it will affect it ? will to give you more of a chance , and the other good players , to have success in the tournament ?
( from italian ) my analysis of the match today is that i feel that you used the backhand okay , but when your opponent hit to your forehand that caused you a problem . and also you tried to go into the court too much when you hit your forehand . is that a correct analysis ?
( from italian ) now that henin has announced her retirement , do you think this is an advantage for you to become no.1 in the world ?
did you have any physical problem today ?
( from italian ) you said you will need to work hard if you want to become no.1 and replace maybe justine at the top of the ranking . but since you were a child you 've been working very hard . you used to train in a swimming pool and train in difficult conditions . do you think all this hard work will make so you tired that maybe in a few year 's time you will also retire and follow in justine 's footsteps ?
what does tennis lose with justine 's retirement ? what did she mean to the game ?
( from italian ) everyone thought you might win rome . you always said that rome has a particular feel to it and it 's very special to you and there is a particular atmosphere . so does this make it all the more disappointing that you have n't done well this year ?
do you feel like there was a game that she won or maybe you lost ?
the games against justine , would you go over them with a fine-tooth comb more often because that 's the girl you want to beat ?
you said the other day that one of the things you needed to do before the australian open , to win another grand slam , was to improve your self-confidence . does a result like this tonight give you more confidence or does it take it away because you got so close ?
when you were up 3-love in the third and then things changed , can you just kind of explain more in depth what was going on ?
did you notice anything different about her game , her tactics , from the last time you played her ?
you said you worked hard in the off-season . what were some the things that you did do get prepared for this season ?
but you did n't work on any specific part of your game , like the forehand , backhand , serve ?
so you 're hoping it be a lot bigger tool this season than it was last season ?
so you 're feeling good going into the open ?
did you have a look at your draw ? the draw is out .
when did you go to melbourne ?
is that the perfect build up for the australian open , or would you have liked to play more matches ?
you 've won 28 matches in a row now , 16 against the world no.2 . do you feel you 're going into the open almost unbeatable ?
what does that sort of really close game like that do for you ? does it really make you feel you 're exactly where you want to be ?
she told us she 's worked on her forehand over the break . did you notice an improvement ?
you had to sticky tape the skirt up ?
nine double faults . was that the nerves ?
are you feeling physically strong ?
do you fear anybody in melbourne ? do you feel that anyone is getting bit closer to you ?
you said you worked on your serve in the off-season . just make adjustments from last year or are you working on something completely new ?
your 18th meeting with justine tomorrow . you getting sick of this in the final ?
it 's not intimidating at all ?
and you 're quite good friends .
is it hard playing a good friend ?
how big do you think the gap is between no.1 and no.2 ?
without divulging your game plan tomorrow , what one or two things do you need to do to be spot on with justine ?
three tough three-set matches . i know you 're disappointed , but is the right amount of preparation for you for melbourne ?
you played justine in the wta championship in madrid .
she 's had a break and you 've been back playing . did you notice anything different about her game , or was it the same level as where it was ?
will you stay in sydney for the next couple days or head to melbourne ?
if you had to play this match today again , what would you do differently that would give you a slightly better chance to beat her ?
do you think you were just a little bit tired or lost a little bit of concentration ?
correct me if i 'm wrong , but today was the first time that you 've won a set off justine .
is that something that you think you achieved , or was it her level that had reduced ?
as your tennis improves and your profile lifts , how to you balance the glamourous side and the tennis side of your life ?
you 've been compared with anna kournikova . the big difference with anna she never won a title and you 've won five titles . do you think it 's unfair to have those comparisons against you ? how do you break out of that mold ?
you 've had a lot of publicity this week about your glamour and there were votes where you 're voted the sexiest player and that sort of thing . how do you react to that ?
do you expect to get more of that kind of publicity in melbourne next week ? do you have to block it out and not read of papers ?
is that becoming more difficult as you get more of this kind of pup publicity , or is it the same ?
does your family help with that as well ? i think you 're very close with them .
how important is it for you to make this final given you 've only had a couple of the matches going into the australian open ?
she said she took a set off you for the first time in the four matches you 've played . she thought she put a bit more pressure on you ?
what was it exactly that you changed in the third set to the second and allowed you to regain control ?
you dropped your serve three times in the second set . does it get to a stage where you worry about that , or was it just the wind ?
you talked about your attitude there . did you play with a lot more freedom in 2007 than you have before , more flair ?
could you comment on the tennis balls ? some players seem to think they 're getting fluffed up and are quite heavy by the end of the nine games before the change .
the fact that you can come out after just a couple of games and beat the world no.4 , does that show the gap between you and the next few players is widening ?
would you talk about your possible opponents .
have you had a chance to chat with kim at all lately ?
svetlana said that she loves your -- not to play against it -- but your inside out forehand . she thinks it 's one of your best shots and it 's one she found difficult last year . people still go ooh and ah on your backhand . do you hear the crowd ?
how do you feel about your form going into the australian open ?
it 's been a few years since you won a breakthrough grand slam , and you 've been knocking on the door last couple of years . what do you have to do to your game to take it to the next step ?
you played on court 1 yesterday and on centre court today . did you notice any change , difference ?
there 's been a couple comments from fabrice santoro and richard gasquet that the ball is a little slower and you have to use a lot more power . do you find that ?
do you see that this year 's australian open is as open as it 's every been ?
do i think that when everyone is playing their best she 's the best ?
how much does fitness play a part at the australian open more than the other grand slams because of its timing ?
are you playing doubles in melbourne ?
do you think the change in the courts will make this year 's australian open a little bit more of a lottery to everyone ?
what sort of shape do you feel you are going into the open ?
gradually sort of getting closer . what do you need to do make the breakthrough to win a grand slam ?
the australian open because of the heat has always been a little bit of a survival of the fittest . you trained in australia in the off-season . do you feel you 're in the right sort of condition to make this the one ?
do you think this surface suits your game well to be successful at the australian open ?
svetlana was here before and she said that when justine henin is at her best she 's probably the hardest player to beat . who do you think are the main contenders for the open ?
we just saw you with a koala . is that your first encounter with a koala ?
you thought they 're just cuddly , tame creatures ?
you 've had a few days in sydney now . what do you think about sydney ?
if you had time to do something in sydney , what would it be ?
in the match today , what happened in the second set ?
did the noise of the serbian fans distract you or help get you back in the match ?
so you would n't be for , say , like the world team tennis where the fans can cheer during the whole match ? you prefer it quiet during the points ?
nice encouraging start to the year . what sort of shape do you think you are in going into the open ?
did you feel like maybe you needed one more game just to get used to the heat and the surface ?
when did you start preparing to come to australia ?
you have very strong legs . do you do a lot of running or a lot of cycling ?
when you 're playing your first game of the season and you face somebody you never played before , what are the sort of potential dangers there ?
you have a very good record at the australian open . what do you think is it about that tournament that seems to bring out the best in you ?
do you think you have a point to prove at all after what happened two years ago , unfinished business ?
did you think the women 's draw in melbourne is really open ? do you think it could be more open ?
svetlana was here and she said you 're the favorite . do you see yourself as the favorite ?
i know you like being no.1 . do you feel as like one of the drawbacks it 's having a target on your back ?
do you feel like that 's a downside ?
can i just ask you , off the court i know you love australia , but sydney specifically , have you had much time to get around this time ?
if you could have time this week , what would be the top three things on your list to do in sydney ?
tough match ?
you called the coach at 5-3. what did he say to you ? what did you talk about ?
do you find that much of an advantage ? to call the coach obviously has n't been around for a long time . do the players sort of appreciate that ?
i do n't want to read too much into the way you grew up practicing tennis in serbia , but do you feel that maybe you have element of toughness that some players just ca n't match just knowing where you come out of ?
bu specifically like , i guess , playing tennis in a swimming pool . it was n't exactly like doing it out of glitz and glamour .
would you like to think now that you have the game -- obviously you 've got to a grand slam final -- but you have the game and the challenge to win down in melbourne ?
there were some groundstrokes that went long . did you find the court slow at all , or did it make any difference to you at all ?
had you been in australia some time in december ?
doing what , practicing ?
any particular things that you enjoyed that it nothing to do with tennis ?
does hearing the fans add to your confidence ?
obviously great disappointment . what could you tell us about how your mind is and your mood right now ?
are there any positive that you can take away from this match ?
does it take a couple of days to get over a loss , or just want to get straight back into it ?
how did you feel physically from this match ?
do you think you 'll do more drilling and more set practice in the next week ?
do you feel like your game is there and you 're just not being able to get the consistency or confidence ?
great match .
tough draw .
it 's been five years now out of the top 10. back in there now . what 's been the key to your turnaround ?
what sort of goals have you set for yourself for 2008 , and more immediately this summer .
are you more confident in getting out of tough matches given your improved ranking and confidence ?
did you feel like you 've down your australian open preparation in one match ?
are there areas of your game that you tinker with a lot . do you change anything about your game at all ?
what is about tennis that you just could n't live without ?
can you tell us your evaluation of how the match went today ?
this is your third final this year . did you approach this any different than the other finals ?
was that painful for you , svetlana ?
do you think you 're a different player in these finals than you are in the earlier rounds ?
do you think she can beat justine any time soon ?
can you talk about the fans ? i guess a couple of times they were making some noise .
people are always asking you , it seems , about how you play in the finals . does that seem a bit strange to you since you won seven tournaments last year ?
was it nine ?
so what do you have to improve ?
looked like you almost turned it around because you break back and then hold . seemed like everyone was thinking maybe you were back in the match . momentum seemed to go back and you went back quickly .
is there a particular point when you get a sense , this is starting to get away , when the pressure starts to build ?
svetlana , radwanska , who you beat in the quarterfinals , told me it was very different svetlana this tournament than at australian open when she beat you . that means you progress . do you think you can do better in miami ?
congratulations .
very confident victory , and in the final match , as well . you probably can tell us how many winners you hit down the line , but as well what does this win and the championship mean to you and for the future of your game and this season ?
this is the first time you 've come into a big tournament , tier 1 as the top seed with pressure , and you came through . can you talk about that process and how it feels ?
what parts of your game were you most happy with today ? could you describe them ?
you always mention how monica seles was your idol and you watched her as a young kid . it seems that the biggest similarity between you and her is that mental toughness that you have . like in the eighth game of the first set you had those unforced errors and you then you came back roaring with like three points . do you think about that at all , or that toughness comes naturally to you .
svetlana talked about at some point in the match she felt like the pressure was starting to build and maybe she lost a little bit of her confidence . from the other side of the net , can you tell when an opponent is starting to lose it a little bit or maybe there is a slippage of confidence that you can jump on ?
with milorad cavic , what happened with him with the suspension , is there pressure on prominent serbian athletes to kind of make their voices heard in the situation going on with kosovo ?
what would be more important for you to win this year , the wimbledon or the olympics ?
novak is very careful to talk about the future . i 'll go back to my original question . how high you 're setting the goals for your season at this point .
it was very sporting of you to apologize for the fans who cried out in the middle of points . but how does it affect you on the court when something like that happens ?
some players , like sharapova or hingis or seles or graf came to no.1 as teenagers , 17 , 18 , win grand slam titles . you 're 20 now and you keep rising . do you feel like you needed more time to get yourself personally , mentally , technically together ?
when did that belief begin to take off ? when did you really feel that , hey , i 've got it going ?
have you and novak ever had the same coach ? i ask because there seems to be some similarities in the way you play , you know , the hard forehand ?
are there any areas of your game that you want to improve , that you think need improvement right now ?
you said you do n't know too much about the politics , but you know history , and the history between russia and serbia was always good . maybe great . is n't it difficult for you to beat your close friend svetlana from russia , who was always friendly to serbia ?
you talk a lot about keeping your emotions in control on court , and even though you have a good disposition , looks likes sometimes you 're fighting with yourself to keep emotions in check . when you win the tournament you let out this squeal , this squeak that pierces everyone 's eardrums . can you just talk about the moment of winning , what it feels like and everything coming out then ?
how are you going to celebrate this great win ? now your mother is here . are you going to be with your team or here or somewhere else ?
one of the things you see the no.1s and the champions do is win a big tournament and then follow it up , not going second round , third round out . but mentally and physically you 're being able to keep it together . is that part of the process going forward for you ?
i remember last year when you won la novak won canada , but i do n't think on the pro tour you 've won in the same place . did you ever win a junior tournament on the same day or same place together ?
a lot of the fans that were up in the upper deck , they come from texas and san francisco and phoenix , far away , to kind of watch you and nole play . can you describe how maybe your success as individuals or in a group are important to people in serbia ?
does that sort of speak to the pride and serbian culture that people have amongst each other ?
were you aware she was hurt before she had the trainer come over ? were you aware ?
is it disappointing sometimes , jelena , in a quarter , you play two matches against her in the fall where you want to test yourself that the match ends that way ?
so you get to play one of your favorite rivals again in the next round .
in this event last year , you , ivanovic and sharapova all failed to make the quarterfinals . now here you are all in the semis . what does that tell you about women 's tennis ?
sampras did n't always play well in the desert either . when he would come here , he would find that the ball would fly on him . he hit a lot of balls long . do you have the same problem ?
you said things in a year , so much changes . when we 're sitting here next year , what would be a successful year , having become what ranking ? having won maybe a major or two ? what are your thoughts ?
do you think that in a year 's time you and ana , who have this momentum going , do you think you 'll be at the very top and surpass the others there ?
you 've said before that ana 's game does n't suit you , but you played her very close the last couple of times and she 's managed to pull it out in the end . is it more mental ? are you finding she 's mentally stronger at the end ?
la , semis .
has there been like one major adjustment you 've made here that allows you to be successful , unlike past years ? like has there been one thing ...
you played fed cup with ana for the first time . did your relationship change there with her ?
what i meant was i was n't saying you 're friends or not , but did you have a chance to talk with her more ?
have a party ?
you were a student a while ago . the other day ana was talking about her interest in psychology and freud and some books she was reading . are you doing some reading ? do you have some interest in those type of areas ?
she seems like a very special tennis parent and embraces ...
can you treat a match against ana like any other match , or does it mean more since you guys are both from the same country ?
your mom 's an economist , so who spends more money when you guys go shopping ?
so how much was the bag ?
i do want to know .
is that the most expensive thing he bought you ?
you 're right .
have you bought property in serbia and more in florida ?
nice . close to the tournament ?
yeah , close .
we each get a bag ?
is the property by itself or is it in one of those developments in rancho santa fe ?
where again is the lot ?
rancho santa fe ?
are you designing the house ? are you going to do the architecture , or is your mom or dad ?
nice to have money , eh ? how many shoes and how many bags do you have ?
how many shoes and how many bags do you have ?
serena williams said that when she was decorating her house she got very tired of shopping for chandeliers . can you imagine getting tired of shopping ?
talk about that match a little .
when you get up in the morning and you know you have to play vera , good veteran player but someone you 're better than , and then you see you have to play jankovic or davenport , can you really avoid thinking about that ?
was it your best match of the tournament so far ?
to look at a match like this , do you sometimes make things a little bit hard for yourself ? looks like you were starting to take charge in the second set .
you came into this tournaments as the top seed . do you feel like you 're the favorite ? you look around , and mrs. maria is in the draw , and other people . do you actually feel like you 're the favorite going into these tournaments , or do you still feel like your ranking is up there , but really you 're not at the top top level of the game ?
what did you call the trainer for ?
you won the first four games in 10 minutes . did it occur to you you might be out of there in like 25 minutes ?
how long did it take you to realize that you could win matches not playing well ?
so what gear were you in today ?
when i look at your team i see obviously sven is very involved in the tennis . what do you think goes on with your mom watching match after match ? she 's pretty shy . how do you think that is for her ?
do you ever talk about the tennis with her ?
back even when you were a kid she was pretty quiet ?
have you seen a video of the final of the australian open ? and if you have , what do you think about it ?
i was talking to some ball kids yesterday and asking who the nice players are and the bad players are ( laughter . ) you 're one of the nice players by far .
so do you think about the ball kids when you 're playing and not being too nasty to them ?
when you came into sydney early in december and started training over there , do you feel that a lot of that work is paying dividends now , or is it going to be a little further down the road this year ?
what was your experience playing fed cup with jelena for the first time ?
what i meant was you were with jelena and you 've been across the court from her five times . this is the first time you two have been together in the same place . so did it change your relationship at all ?
can you talk about the next round playing either jelena or lindsay ?
do you remember watching any of lindsay 's grand slam finals ? any memory of , say , wimbledon or the us open , australia ? nothing ?
no more squeaky shoes ?
what happened ?
you did n't hurt it out there then , you hurt it in practice ?
lower back , upper back ?
so when exactly did you hurt it ?
you 've been down this road before , so just talk about what you think is going to happen during the next few weeks .
does it sort of bring it back home again ? i 'm back on the tour now , injuries are back ?
it 's a real balancing act for you , too , right ? because you need the matches ?
does something like this make you question whether attempting to balance tennis and motherhood was wise ?
what 's the timetable before you make your decision about miami ? and how much will the fed cup affect that decision about playing miami ?
because the goal is wimbledon , olympics , us open , things like this probably do n't set you back that much , huh ?
so what 's your feelings on venus not playing fed cup ?
have you been texting her or anything ?
are you actually willing to play singles on clay if ...
what were your thoughts on monica 's performance the other night ?
would you mind handicapping the two semifinal matches tomorrow ?
straight-sets win . how happy were you with your performance today ?
was the difference just focus ?
when you go out for a match like today , any memories of the australian open or is it a new match , new tournament ?
you only dropped one set so far this week . overall , are you happy with how you 've played ?
do you have any preference to who you play ?
can you look back at last year 's final against daniela , kind of what worked , what did n't ?
how do you guard against those moments ? you 've talked about you played a good tournament , but then you had a couple drops here and there . what kind of things are you trying to do to keep more of that even keel ?
as part of your preparation , will you watch the match tonight ?
you ever look at yourself on youtube ? i was looking yesterday . i saw you do some karaoke .
did you see the other ones ?
no , i 'm talking about ...
did you see novak 's one ?
so when you go out on the town , do you do karaoke or not ?
i asked lleyton about it last night , and he makes it sound like they lied to all of you to get you to do that .
so karaoke is dead for you now ?
if you had a choice of a song , what would it be ?
did you watch monica last night on tv ?
she had a tough night .
she only got 15s out of 30 .
the high score is a 10 and she got 5s , and that 's pretty low . very stiff .
in australia scott draper is on the show at the moment and doing very well .
todd woodbridge did n't do so well .
so you 're next ?
what do you prefer , singing or dancing ?
you said you improved the second time you did karaoke . maybe that third time with a bit of practice it 'll be really good .
that was quite an escape there ?
what did she do well ?
do you have any idea why you were thinking about what she was doing ? because you 've often said you 've just got to take care of your side of the net .
were you having a problem reading her second serve , or were you just missing ?
yeah ?
was there anything with the stadium with the shadows this time of day ? seemed kind of uneven on court . i do n't know if that was a factor .
when you miss most of the time , do you feel like you know why you miss , and are you able to make adjustments ?
you played so well this year . is this the most you 've struggled this year in a match ?
daniela says she 's motivated because she feels like she owns this place . you won here two years ago , and you have a good record against her , but she does seem to play a little bit her on center court . so just talk about that match .
a lot of people are talking about the appearance on tv this evening of monica seles on dancing with the stars ?
i believe it 's tonight .
so you come from the country that probably has the best history of dance in the world . have you ever gone to any of the great dancing performances in russia , done much dancing yourself ?
9:00 .
i mean , lindsay 's despondent that she wo n't be able to see it .
if you could go on the show and dance with anyone , can you think of anyone you 'd like to dance with ?
ana ivanovic yesterday spoke to us a lot about how she reads freud , and she went on for about 10 minutes .
read freud , sigmund freud , the psychologist .
the psychologist . very famous ?
and she went into the details about how she is knowledgeable about the subject . i was wondering what you read ? do you read russian authors , like dostoevsky , in spare time ?
you have given $ 100,000 to that project . can you little bit more elaborate on the united nations and chernobyl ?
sorry to talk about tennis again , but have you ever felt more confident on the court than you do right now ?
can you talk about the match today ? it seemed pretty routine for you today ?
you feel like you 're in you 're stride right now ?
so a revenge match ?
where are you hanging mostly when you 're not travel in ? are you in spain ? are you in russia ?
when did you change your residence to monte-carlo ?
do you live near any other tennis players in monte-carlo ?
did you run into the other players like grocery shopping things like that ?
can you just talk about the australian open match against her .
do you handle the pressure now better than you used to ?
are there more good than bad days than there used to be ?
there are so many good russian players . do you have any idea who will be on the olympic team at this point ? probably you and maria and chakvetadke .
where is the olympics as a priority for you ? for some players it 's different . obviously andy is not playing .
really ?
so if you could have a wimbledon title or the olympic gold medal ...
no question ?
wow . what about the french ?
the french ?
but it 's that important to you ?
but it is tough . it ends right before the us open , and that 's ...
maybe you should enter in cycling in the olympics ?
do you say that in front of your parents ?
will they go to the olympics , do you think , your parents ?
do your parents travel with you at all ? i do n't think i 've ever seen them .
in your life ?
in your life he 's seen you play .
so it 's not healthy .
but your mother has never come when , like when you 're in the french open final or the us open final ?
right . i wo n't come sit in your box if you 're winning , sveta . i promise you .
but your mother does n't say , oh , i 'd like to see you play in a tournament ?
right . but just to be clear , your father and your mother have never come to watch a professional match ?
but your father is too nervous , or he 's not interested or you do n't want him there ?
right .
that was the kremlin cup ?
in what year ?
you 're not saying that he 's banned from watching you play professionally ?
do you care about the dancing thing that monica seles is doing tonight , dancing with the stars ?
i think 8:00 .
did she do bad and that 's why she did n't give you the video ?
what are you sick with ?
oh , really ?
did n't seem it affect you on the court today , or did it ?
did you feel the cold and all that coming on over the last couple days ?
sounds sexier .
let me ask you real quick , at this tournament you kind of struggled before this year . i think the record was , like , 3-5 .
you told us about , dancing , you did n't like your dancing skills that much .
you want to talk about that match a little bit ?
it 's been kind of a tough tournament for you . you had the three setter the first match , too .
what did you talk about with sven after the second set ?
that was pretty brisk .
that was pretty brisk , businesslike .
is it on your toss that the wind is the worst ?
did you play in doha a couple weeks ago ? because i believe the wind was pretty bad there .
how 's your body these days ? do you feel you 're getting healthier and healthier ?
what does it mean to be fit ? i mean , you 're out here , you 're playing matches . what do you mean by `` being fit '' ?
the other question is not related to tennis but to politics . after those changes in the balkans , the serbians still keep their old anthem or they change it ?
a new one ?
would you ever not participate in the olympics ? is that important to you , or not ?
would you ever not participate ?
considering how you 're tired , you get injured , players complain about the long schedule , i mean ...
when you hear other players say they 're not going to participate , do you think they 're crazy , or can you understand their reasons ?
is it fair to say it will hurt your preparation for the us open , though , to play in beijing ?
how did you feel about the match ?
how were the conditions out there ? is it difficult in the wind ?
what is your decision about not playing the olympics ?
so if you were playing on fed cup -- do you want to play the olympics , or you do n't care or ...
with the calendar so packed as it is already , i mean , do you think that ...
you had a lot of trouble closing out the match . is that a confidence issue ?
she plays you tough for some reason ? why do you think ?
so how do you like the new wta thing about being able to call down your coach any time you want during one set ?
i 'm not talking about after sets , but now you can call them at any changeover .
so are you going to do it after the fifth game of your next match then ?
once a set , unless there 's ...
you 've talked about him before , and i know he 's your good friend , but as a coach , how much he 's helped you and how much that relationship has helped your tennis overall ?
what do you like about novak djokovic as a tennis player and colleague and as well as a person ?
unlike somebody else .
you 're such a good sport . you know , there was lots of talk about when he was impersonating and all of this . apparently , i do n't know about it , but apparently he 's going to be on jay leno . you 're going to watch it or see it ?
and ?
have you ever gone on youtube to see how many videos they have of him impersonating you on youtube ?
what did your family say about the impersonation ?
andy roddick lost today obviously , and for the last few years he 's been kind of stuck in the middle of the pack , in the middle of the top 10 , no.5 , no.6 , and he wants to get to that next level . i 'm curious , as a player yourself , when you get to a certain level of play and you 're practicing every day , how hard is it to really make improvements where you see the results and you really feel it to the point where you can kind of break through ?
i 'm not even saying for advice , just have you ever felt like you 've hit a wall and you just ca n't get better ? and then after a while , maybe after a year or two , you start seeing better results ?
how deep is gwen stefani into tennis ? does she talk about it a lot when you hang out with her ?
did n't she just do a xo with you before the tournament ?
he 's big into tennis .
he 's decent ?
can you talk about your next opponent ? were you surprised how easily she won today against mauresmo ?
were you surprised by that score today ?
1 and 2 .
marat and novak are two of the whackiest players on tour .
whackiest , most fun loving .
who was funnier between the two ?
so are novak 's jokes and comments off court as funny as his mime routines on court ? is he that funny off court , as well ?
sorry to ask you this .
it 's not necessarily a subject that you like , but just recently in australia - you may have heard about this - a nine-year-old girl in melbourne was banned because of grunting , banned from tennis . she says her idol is maria sharapova . what are your thoughts on something like that for a nine-year-old girl ?
apparently the woman that was overseeing the whole competition said , either you stop grunting or you do n't come back .
monica seles also did , you know . i played with her when she was a young girl . she did all the time , you know . you might not remember , otherwise her career could n't exist .
you look to be so in control in the first set . what happened in the second set ?
do you take anything out of that match ?
the conditions a problem at all today ?
you must be pleased your match was today and not yesterday , given the strong wind ?
when you are down 5-love like that , how important is it to try and , you know , rather than just say , forget this set ; i 'll get her next set ? how important is it to try and come back right then ?
you 've reached a couple of finals earlier this year , i believe ? how happy have you been with your form this season ?
how did you feel out there today ?
this is the farthest you 've gone in this tournament ?
are you feeling pretty good about where you are a at in the tournament now ?
every year for i think nine years you keep going up in the rankings consistently . what do you have to do this year to keep going ? i 'm sure it gets harder as you get higher .
what did you do very well today ? what were some of the things you did the best ?
how do you approach playing somebody like mauresmo ? she gives you lots of different variety and looks . what do you do in that instance ?
can you talk a little bit about your results this year ? because they have n't been as good as last year in singles .
so what do you have to do to get your singles form back to where you want it to ?
how long will you take off from doubles ?
two weeks ?
so you wo n't play doubles here or miami ?
okay . gotcha .
do you hope to be as good as the bryan brothers some day ?
do you find doubles to be more fun than singles ?
who is the leader on the court between you and katerina ?
you think ?

are you a hundred percent healthy right now ?
it says you pulled out with a lower back injury earlier in the year . there were 10 players retiring with injuries at this tournament . do you think next year when the wta changes the structure and reduces the number of games you play , do you think people will stay healthier ? or is it normal wear and tear because it 's late in the season ?

seven days .
how do you compare your match to the match you played against her in fed cup ?
how would you assess your ability to handle pressure ?

there have been a lot of complaints over the years that the schedule might be too busy , especially at this time of year . do you get a sense of that right now ?

the entries are in now .
you 're a wimbledon champion .
did you feel any of the fatigue that you felt today in either of your first two matches ?
people in montral were pretty enthusiastic with wozniak and dubois . since cibulkova is a hit taking out a lot of top players , you said you were having a tough time playing against canadians in front of this crowd . today the crowd was a little bit on her side . how did you feel ?

you 're becoming the crowd 's darling right now . how do you feel about that ?
you had a very good match against sharapova in the final at amelia island . has that tournament been an important step for you ?

like the competitiveness of it , i guess .
if everyone can get there , what would you say to you is the number one quality that you need to have in order to become no.1 ?

more disciplined now ?
are you enjoying working harder , working this way ?
do you know very well kuznetsova ?
you played very often ?
what 's your record ?

how is this tournament helping you prepare for the olympics ?
whose games have you watched that you appreciate either in the past or now playing , men or women ?
back to today 's game . did you get scared at some point that she might steal it away from you ?
i think there were five breaks in the third set .
twice , then you broke here three times .
when you play a young player like that , do you feel she goes out there and she does n't have any pressure open her ?
can you describe the match today .
you came back in your doubles match from several games down in the second set .
when you play such a high-level player , at the beginning you might feel frightened , but maybe your win over kirilenko , were you able to learn a bit about her game or what it feels like to try and learn how to combat it instead of being defensive ?
do you feel this week has kind of made you feel you belong even more so with the elite in tennis ? does it feel like a breakout week ?
even two years ago against clijsters , there might be an overwhelming feeling of the power and placement . there was no sense of being overwhelmed by a 2 seed today . i 'm talking about the next level up .
after that first set , which was obviously difficult for you , to be able to compete in the second set , not just kind of give up , what does that tell you about where you 're at right now ?
do you think in prior years or earlier in your career you would have been able to fight back in that second set after having lost 6-love in the first ?
the other night was such a high , the crowd was with you . the first set started and finished ...
do you take it as an encouraging thing you could get your head together for the second set ?
what would be your biggest regret about the match ? if you could change something , what would you do different ?
it seems like overall you 're a better player than her , better strokes , but she 's very strong mentally . did you feel that ?
did you feel they were unfair ?
have you played in those conditions before , with a crowd that much for your opponent ?
did you know much about her before the match ?

collapse ?

is it just the thumb ?
were you injured before you came to montral ?

the match against chakvetadze you had in wimbledon , how much did that teach you ?
could you talk a little bit about how much your coach helped you .
did he help you ?
what were you thinking after you lost the second set ?
yes .
what pleases you more , the shot-making or the mental toughness , especially down 5-4 ?
how about the crowd ? do you feed off a crowd like that ?
is this a better moment than clijsters two years ago because of how that ended compared to how this ended as you head into the third round ?
it seemed like not only were you coming through on the big points , but it seemed like kirilenko was mirroring you a lot .
coming back with the same type of shot you were making . did you feel like you were in control going forward ?
i understand a lot of wind on the court , but did n't seem to bother you .
was it as easy as you made it look ?
is keeping your concentration when you 're doing that well and winning that easily one of the great challenges that you 're able to do because you 're a veteran ?
did you anticipate the easy win ?
are you surprised at the result ?
are you on the russian olympic team ?
is it a big frustration ?
what happened out there today ?
was being at home a factor , pressure , anything like that ?
how was it dealing with having your match canceled last night and having to play today ?
is it easier to feed off this crowd here in an evening match than a day match ?
how does aleksandra 's win a couple weeks ago at stanford give a boost to the canadian players ?
where do you feel you are in you are career now ?
you said mexico next ?
can you quickly go over the match a little bit . you did n't get to finish it .
can you talk a bit about your year so far , which pretty good .
are you looking forward to going back to hard courts ?
would you like to draw a comparison between the sport of cycling and tennis ? do you see a comparison ?
nadia petrova said before she does n't mind not to compete in the olympics because it will be very difficult to go to china and come back . what is your feeling about that ?
is it really big ?
but is it bigger than a tournament like here ?
the competition is easier in the olympics because some good players are not qualified .
some very good russian players wo n't be there .
sometimes you could lose against a player like chakvetadze .
do you follow the men 's tennis ?
so who are you rooting for , nadal or federer ?
why ?
do you know what the score of the first set was in cincinnati today ?
he was playing ginepri .
yes . he served for the first set at 5-4 and then it went to a tiebreak , he was down 5-love , he lost in the first-set tiebreak .
you 've been at the top almost as long as him .
do you think of taking maybe four months and just clearing your head and trying to come back ?
what would be the ideal time ? one , two , three , four months ?
so it 's only really two months ?
the best time to do it would be at the beginning of november , forget the australian open , maybe start in march .
it 's all intriguing , right ?
can you talk to us about your game ?
your next game , you 're facing stephanie dubois . she 'll be benefitting from support from the fans . you have never faced her before . did you watch her game yesterday ?
do you know her ?
could you give us a little hint ?
what about the support from the montral fans ? how will it feel to be the bad one on the court ?
is it still something you can use as a source of motivation ?
apparently there 's a virus running around . are you feeling sick at all ?
your game is at the level you want it right now ?
you still a very good ranking right now . you 're 13 for this tournament . is your ranking something you think about when you 're on the court ?
what happens when you 're down 40-love in a game ? when you 're playing the next point , are you focusing on going bigger or play it like it 's any point ?
you had a veteran out there today . how did it go for you ?
you both seemed to have trouble with your serve . was the wind a factor out there ?
what was it like for you to play in this tournament , main draw ?
what are your plans now ? are you still an amateur ?
are you going to turn pro , go to college ?
are you accepted there ?
what is the name of the high school you were at ?
that 's in toronto ?
the university is obviously an attractive thing . what would you be studying at harvard ?
do you have anything coming up tennis-wise ?
challengers or futures ?
i know you 've been at wimbledon before and stuff like that , but have you ever had a rain delay like this before ?
how do you stay focused when something like that happens ?
is that what happened in the second set there a little bit ?
you lost to her in the first round here last year , in toronto .
i was looking at your record . you have a lot of tough three-set matches .
sure you 'd rather do a little less than seven hours , though .
your father spent some time in canada , is that right ?
so you 're almost a home player ?
so did you have people here tonight for you ?
can you tell us what book you were reading ?
better not finish it ?
in the second set you said you were sick . how difficult was that to play ?
will you be okay the rest of the week ? is it just one day ?
have other players got this ?
is that just here or did that come from somewhere else ? did the players bring it with them from california or whatever ?
are you looking forward to the opportunity to play chakvetadze again so soon after winning ?
can you explain to us what happened in the first set , it was so up-and-down , up-and-down ?
overall , what do you take away from the week ?
you said yesterday that you were going to try to not only win the final , but enjoy the day and enjoy the final . what went wrong do you think ?
as you saw the game slowly slipping away , do you think with hindsight you might have sort of given up too easily ?
finally , you had quite a lot of support out there . any message for your fans ?
after this hectic week , what are you planning to do ?
do you think in your mind what this tournament change a little bit the russians ? you come here as one of the last russians and now you go for the final , you play very well this week . i already asked you , but maybe you can say something more about what will change after this for you ?
must be a lovely feeling to end the season in that way , is it ?
what were your feelings after the first set which surprisingly slipped away ?
did you change anything in the second and third sets as well ? you came to the net a little bit more than she ?
and looking back over the whole week , what for the future and next year for you and what you 've done over these days ?
it must be absolutely fantastic . did you feel after you 'd won the first set , and the longer the game went and you saw the frustrations of your opponent that she was probably caving in ?
i 'm assuming that , like your mother who i spoke to earlier , in blackburn , and lancashire in the uk where there is a large contingent of the minorities that support the williams sisters , what message can you send them ?
have you heard of blackburn ?
could you replay for me the look you gave to the referee when they make a wrong decision on the passing shot in the tiebreak ? when it was to protest , you asked for the hawkeye . she make the wrong decision , you looked to the referee like you were killing her . what was that look ? can you do it ?
which part of the match do you think was the real venus ?
vera was in an obvious sort of emotional distress at some points in the third set . were you aware of that ? does it give you an extra shot of confidence or do you screen it out ?
you finally won one of the few major tournaments you 've never won before . does it make it extra special ?
does it feel a little bit overdo that you missed your first slam final more than ten years ago ?
yeah .
can you take momentum from an event like this into next season and into another event that you never won , the aussie open ?
are you satisfied with sort of the final details that have been ironed out in the road map this week ?
so , first big final . how does it feel ?
no , but grand slams , championships , they are the big ones , so ... you do n't consider it as a big one , this one ?
if someone had told you before the tournament starts that you would go for the final winning all matches , what would you have said ?
can you sum up the match tonight ?
a lot of people probably would n't have expected you to get this far . i 'm just wondering did you arrive here with a lot of confidence , or has that sort of grown as each match has gone on ?
maybe that should be your approach now for every tournament ?
obviously , you 're here to win and getting to the finals is a great success . but i 'm guessing this is going to be the biggest payday for you by far . there is a lot of money at this tournament . do you not think about that a little bit ?
can i just ask what you think about on-court coaching ? next year when it 's introduced ?
do you think you 'll be using it ?
talking about coach , tell us something , is this superstition or something else . but your coach sometimes is in the box next to the court , and sometimes he 's not . he 's hiding somewhere . so why is that ?
it does n't bother you . it does n't bother you to see him in the box , and then all of a sudden he 's not there anymore ?
tomorrow in the final , it 's a very , very big day for you , big occasion , plenty at stake . if we can possibly go into the future , could you possibly give us an insight into what might be going through your mind if the game is going well for you or if it 's not going too well for you equally ?
moving aside from today 's game , you were at the unesco launch the other day . the tournament here and your representation on behalf of the players , what sorts of impact do you think these tournaments have on wider issues in this area ?
could we possibly see it sometime in the future which we have done in football , with the david beckham academy , academies being set up here by players ?
as in football , where we 've had david beckham setting up his own football academy , could we possibly long-term see players setting up an academy here ?
you had to fight very hard for that , did n't you , especially in the final set ?
what got you through the match today ?
can you tell us a little bit about that very long game at 3-2 in the final set which had , i think , six deuces ?
were you physically stressed in the last part of that final set ?
as well as attacking through some of the match , you also had to spend some time containing as well while she attacked .
this is the biggest final you 've never been in before what , does that mean to you to make it ?
but is it pleasing to you to sort of fit that one into the rest of your achievements ?
zvonareva , what are your thoughts about playing her ? what are your memories from playing her in the past ?
what sort of player would you categorize her as ?
on another matter , billie jean king was talking during the week , and talking about her role in what happened 30-odd years ago and everything . and she said of all the players currently playing , she sees you as the sort of leader figure as she was in those days . do you go along with that ?
but you play , the things you said and wrote had a lot to do with equal prize money issue ?
to be a little bit smarter , how much is connected with your physical condition , which is , in my opinion better , and how much is connected with something you change in your technique ? you do something different ? did you try to do something different ?
august , yeah . i think in august you lose a strange match with your sister . you almost won .
did you change something in your preparation in physical training or not , or is everything the same ?
what are your thoughts on this being are a round robin format eight players as opposed to the previous system with the 16-player knockout ?
now that you 've beaten the world 's no.1 , do you think that you can slightly take your foot off the accelerator ?
take your foot slightly off the accelerator now ?
will you treat your opponent tomorrow slightly different then ?
today 's match , i noticed that your sister and your mother were both rooting for you . were you aware of the sort of shouting ?
and in a week when we 've got barack obama becoming the first black president in america , do you feel confident enough to put the cherry on the cake tomorrow by winning the tournament ?
you were talking about what 's good for the tour and next year with the calendar it 's going to be more combined events with the men 's and women 's tour . do you think that 's a good thing ? do you like seeing more cooperation between the atp and wta ?
do you think that was really high level game today ?
that sixth game in the final set which had six deuces , i think , and you had five breakpoints , that was pretty crucial that game , was n't it ?
she looked physically quite distressed at some stages in the final set , we thought .
what would you most like to do ?
you appeared to get a warning from the umpire ?
well , i thought you might tell us . we could n't really see ?
according to the television , you were engaging in conversation with , we think your godfather ; is that correct ?
did that distract you the last couple of game when 's it was a really crucial point ?
just the two road maps and the two calendar changes that are taking place next year , going to have more combined events , men and women . are you personally and for the tour , do you think that 's a good thing ? are you in favor of combined events , men and women ? do you like that format ?
combined or back-to-back , yeah .
but personally do you find it a little bit chaotic ?
what about on-court coaching ? not tonight but next year .
there were a few line call challenges that were overruled . did that frustrate you ?
you mentioned though that you were n't really affected or aware of what was going around you , but sure you must have taken note of the large vocal support that you had ?
the vocal support that you had from your fans . what message do you have for your fans ?
you finish your season as the no.1 , but do n't you feel any frustration not having been able to win one big , big title ? grand slam or this week in the championship ?
it seems she was hitting the ball maybe harder than you were ?
but you won the second set , so you came back well , and then what happened in the third ?
it just seems that you were in a good mood , because we saw you smiling on the court ?
on another topic , what do you think of on-court coaching , which we 're going to be seeing next year , introduced permanently ?
do you think the players generally support the idea ?
you lost lot of easy balls . do you think you were not ready mentally for the game against vera ?
so now , unfortunately , you 're on holidays . so what are you going to do ?
generally , when do you start working again for next season ?
is andrei olhovsky permanently your coach , or is this sort of a test to see how things went ?
does it feel a little bit surreal . two weeks ago you did n't know if you 'd be here , now you 're undefeated into the semifinals ?
lot of players are feeling tired this time of the year , but you seem to be playing so well . why are you still so strong ?
in your generation of russian players , you are one of the few who did n't take big titles so far . so do you think that this tournament could be a very good opportunity for you to go up there ?
you came in february , first time to doha and you reached the final , and now you are doing so well in three straight wins . how do you see yourself between february and now ? is it the same court , how do you feel yourself on the court ? you are doing , is it your best tennis here ?
jelena who was here earlier said that she 'd already qualified for the semifinal and that to an extent it did n't really matter . she was n't 100 % anyway . what have you got to say about that ?
do her comments possibly take the shine off your win ?
my colleague was saying about taking the shine off your performance . but with does two people withdrawing , such high-profile names , take the shine off the whole tournament ?
but the round robin format , does it really work ? it 's very strange for you guys to be playing in a tournament where you do have games which can mean nothing ?
you could just have a straight knockout then .
you could just have a straight knockout with eight people .
were you aware at all before you went on the court that serena had pulled out ?
could you just talk about the match-up with elena ?
tomorrow .
jelena was just in here and you said earlier in the week she said you were good in the wind . you 've said maybe you play well in the wind . are you aware of that ? do you think of yourself as a good wind player ?
but some players adapt to the conditions better than others , no ?
do you think the road map will help the situation we 're seeing here with players tired and pulling out at the end ?
talking about the format of the tournament . there used to be a 16-player draw . which kind of format , with the straight knockout , which format do you think you 'd prefer , and why ?
we hope that your back is much better than serena 's stomach ?
your back .
you say you 've already qualified for the semis , so the result did n't really matter that much . but there 's a lot of money involved in the match , is it not ?
rather surprised personally that when we spoke to other tennis players they say we 're at the top , and to be at the top every game , irrespective of who you play and what situation you play , you do your best shall and you try to win .
i noticed that at quite a few occasions you were cleaning your nose . one of the other players has suffered from a viral infection . could you have possibly come into something , a cold ?
what kind of issues ?
can you explain how you 're going to do that ?
obviously , it 's not a good idea to criticize the tour , perhaps . but we 've had two leading players pulled out today , which is damaged the tournament . do you have any comment that you can make on how and why that happens and how it can be prevented and will the road map help prevent that in the future ?
just to follow up on that , considering how much money the sponsors have put up and how well you 're treated here , what responsibility do you think the players have ? if they are able to play , if they have -- they 've got a long off-season coming up , several weeks , should n't they , if they 're able to play go ahead and go out there and play ?
just on vera , she qualified so she 's obviously an elite player , but she came in here sort of a dark horse , an outsider . what do you make of how she 's been playing here ?
it 's something you go through many times during the season , but playing a match late in the evening , and the last match on tomorrow --
you 're playing the fourth match .
second match after 5:30. there are two doubles , then the first singles and then yours is the last match .
the second singles .
there 's two doubles matches and then two singles tomorrow . the doubles starts .
so become a doubles player .
can i ask my question now ?
you 're playing the last match late at night , how do you pace yourself during the day ?
so you do n't get too tired ?
before entering the court , were you aware of the fact that serena was not playing ?
have you got a preference , playing dementieva or venus ?
you said the other night after the match against venus williams that you feel that maybe this is not your tournament . things are changing ?
do you think that you you lost too much energy today to win a match that is not important for the tournament ?
you are for one in the record with vera zvonareva what do you expect tomorrow ?
honestly , were you happy that serena to withdraw today ? were you happy to know that serena withdraw today ?
it was just before the match ?
what is your opinion about rafael nadal ?
how do you see him as a tennis player , as a person ?
it 's probably not an easy situation for you , but can you just tell us your thoughts and feelings about the match ?
any idea how and why that happened ?
does n't happen very often for you , not like that ?
sort of came on halfway through the match , really , did n't it ? i mean the first set was okay .
and it 's difficult to give a physical or psychological or any other kind of reason for it ?
the first game of the third set was a really long game . it seemed like that was pivotal as far as momentum was concerned and it seems you got a little down after that ?
so that was n't -- that was a particularly critical game ?
actually thought the last game was great . there were some great points in that game . were you feeling different ? i mean , obviously a bit late . but seemed to be spectacular tennis ?
still feel you 'll be all right to qualify ?
just on another subject , i reads that you were planning a trip to africa for some activities . is that true ? is there anything you can tell us about that plan ?
when you play your sister , what do you think of ?
yeah , what about your techniques ? does it help you when you -- i mean , this is your 18th match with her , with venus . does it help you when you know her techniques or anything ?
what qualities do you think you need now and how do you think you can pick yourself up ?
what qualities do you actually need now , do you think you 'll need to pick yourself back up ?
congratulations , it must be nice to qualify . but is it tennis with sympathy for your sister ?
is this the best you 've played in this competition ? you 've been to the semis twice before , i think , but not made the final .
this is the third time ?
is this the best you 've played in this competition ?
you 're about as close as competitive sisters can be . so what goes through your mind when you see that she was very upset out there on court ? what goes through your mind and what can you do as a big sister afterwards ?
obviously , you 'd be surprised at how easy the last two sets were . you got any understanding why that would be ?
were you surprised she did n't fight more than she used to do as usual , for instance at the us open she was down in both sets and then she came back fighting very well . this time it was not the case ?
did you have a problem with the left knee ? because at the second set at 4-1 , it seemed that you were touching your knee and that you could n't push that much on the left knee afterwards on your serve ?
compared to all your other competitors , because you know your sister really well , you know her personality , what makes her tick , do you find it 's possibly marginally easier to play against her ?
and how do you reconcile the fact that -- i mean , it 's the first time i actually met you and i find you extremely composed , extremely relaxed . you 're in control of yourself with the powerful aggression that 's needed in the game , how do you marry the two together ?
how much of your victory today do you think was down to effective opposition with your sister having a bit of turmoil , especially in the last set , rather than you actually excelling yourself ? or was it a bit of both ?
and confident enough to win ?
yeah .
obviously , it was going to be tough here for you . but you just fell a little bit short of expectations , presumably ?
disappointing though at the end of the week for you ?
what are your immediate plans now between now and the start of next season ?
so it 's 2-2 , all going well ?
two wins in two matches .
with the treatment you received for your back , is it an injury that you 've had before , or is it something new ?
does it feel okay now ?
at the end of the game you acknowledged the crowd and you looked up at the sky to acknowledge possibly some sort of divine intervention . did you feel you might have had a bit of luck today with the injury that you suffered and maybe god was looking down on you favorably ?
how are you going to prepare for the semifinals with the injury possibly bothering you ?
how do you feel now after going through such a grueling match ?
you mentioned the other day that being no.1 there was a perception that everybody was out there to get you , now with the injury as well , does that bring added pressure , and do you feel any sort of way of tackling with it differently now ?
you 're definitely sleeping at night ?
it 's shaping up as though you and vera from this group are going to play the williams sisters from the other group . any preference from your point of view ? which one would you prefer to take on first ?
it looks like the two williams ?
do you feel beating them here would be an even greater endorsement of your world no.1 status ?
but there 's no reason for you you have any fear about either of them ?
it 's a long time that you do n't win at this competition , can you explain why ?
do you have a motivation of before it was an indoor tournament , and now outdoor ?
before in the last years this tournament was indoors , now it 's outdoors .
after beating dinara in the final of beijing , do you think psychologically you have an advantage on her ? can you go to the court and relax because you already have beaten her in beijing ?
tomorrow you will be playing against serena , and if you win you will go to the semifinal . do you think you are ready mentally to the game against serena , because it 's going to be a tough game for sure ?
knowing very well serena , how much are you surprised about the score in the second and the third set , especially the 6-love between the sisters and for players like serena , which is not someone who gives up . what do you think about it ?
i think serena described it as one of the worst matches if not the worst match she 's ever played . does that make her even more of a challenge tomorrow because she 'll be coming back determined ?
so another win for you . what are your thoughts on the match tonight ?
difficult to finish off at the end as well , was n't it ?
you fought your way into this elite gathering at the last moment , so to speak . now you 're almost into the semifinals . are you surprised by how well you 've done here ?
a few years ago sometimes playing a tough match , sometimes your nerves prevented you to win , and now it seems that you are more calm and you are more focused on what you have to do ; is that right ?
at the beginning of the year , could you expect such good results throughout this year and then being qualified for the championship ?
you 've talked about being more experienced and managing your emotions better on the court , have you done something ? have you worked with a sports psychologist ? what have you done to work on that aspect of your game ?
why do you pull the towel over your head on the changeovers ?
you 're not claustrophobic ?
a few months ago i remember we were talking about your wrist injury you had a couple of years ago , and you were saying that you still had to work on that every day , every day to be sure it is going to be good and it is going to be okay . is it still the same now ? are you working every day on that ?
just speaking hypothetically , if jelena were to beat svetlana , you and she would both have two wins and have to play each other . would that take the edge off your game ? how would you approach that match if you knew both jelena and yourself were through ?
i read something very interesting about the studies you did . do you think first of all to be clever , smart , to study a lot , read a lot could be dangerous in a sport because you think too much maybe ? you have too many things on your mind ? you are different to the others or not ?
you do n't feel a little bit different yourself to other people that think just about tennis , just about forehand and backhand ?
and the second question is , how much proud are you about the fact that you are not so tall , so powerful , so big like other players . you are like henin or other players who are still able to play at this level ?
how much credit do you give to your coach who is probably the guy with the quietest guy we know on the tour . he never gets nervous . is he good for you ?
you mentioned earlier that you 've developed that you 're actually more experienced and more developed within yourself . can you give examples of how you 've developed and improved in certain aspects of yourself ?
you also mentioned that other players are more taller , more powerful , stronger . players like yourself who do n't have those sorts of abilities , could there possibly be a perception do you have that you 're disadvantaged and there might be a different type of champion in the future ?
you 've had a good solid season , with two titles . you struggled a bit in the majors and some of your earlier successes at grand slam tournaments . i 'm just wondering why you think you have n't performed well in the big events , and if this is an event where you can really put that behind you ?
we know that you are in the final in the previous championship here in doha , now you are realizing good results in the second win . do you have such feeling in some countries that you feel better in some countries or is it just like that ?
we have to make grand slam here to win it .
you appeared not to feel very well on court again for the second night . how much a cause of the result of the match was that ?
did you actually have any treatment ?
on court you had your blood pressure measured ?
can you still qualify ?
in case of tomorrow jelena wins , do you think you will play the third match considering ?
how are you planning to spend your birthday tomorrow ?
last year in shanghai novak went to the tennis masters cup and he suffered very much the same sort of thing as you . just felt under par , felt sick . did n't give his best . did you speak to him much about that when you met up at all ?
but still even if you are not feeling well you 've been that close to win the match . when do you think it turned ?
just looking to next year , last december you came to london and went to roehampton . any plans to do the same again ?
where in australia particularly are you going to ?
you do n't have family there , do you ?
is he teaching you ?
are you any good ?
have you seen serena surf ?
check it out on youtube . is it harder to go from indoors to outdoors or outdoors to indoors ?
do you have any particular holiday plans after the tournament ?
can you ski ?
i have to ask this , but it 's my only chance to do it . next year in madrid will be a very big tournament , men and women together like a grand slam . what do you expect about that tournament ? how did you feel with the crowd the last two years in madrid ?
do you think that tradition is for change , because the ambition of madrid with the years is trying to find a place with australia for a grand slam . do you think for a player it could be good to change the grand slam or is it a tradition ?
it was a tough match , but what made the difference today ?
do you think you 've ever faced her when she 's given you so many opportunities of her serve not functioning in the way it normally does ?
well , she served an immense amount of double faults for venus ?
you said you might be a bit nervous . that seems a bit surprising having played in so many big games in your career ?
this tournament 's a little bit different ; you get another chance ?
comparing with the previous years where you did play so well in the last couple of years . you were in the same state of mind ? you were as nervous the other years as you were today or not ?
you had a lot of opportunities , can you just talk about in tennis , you know , it 's not really playing well the whole match . it 's playing well at certain moments in a match . is that what was lacking tonight ?
you make a very good point about starting late tonight . has any of you asked any reasons why it does have to start so late ? because the heat is not that oppressive during the daytime is it now ?
what about the transition from being indoors for a while to going outdoors to something like this ? a few of the girls had said that 's been kind of tough .
i was just going to ask if this game goes to three sets as well , they could be playing past midnight . have you ever been playing before that time past midnight ?
do you think you still have some strength left to play well the next two matches ?
you obviously handled the conditions better than your opponent , but were they difficult ? it looked very windy ?
traditionally , do you dislike playing in the wind ? how does your game normally play in the wind ?
is this your first victory in the sony ericsson championships , and more so it should be important for you because you had lost to svetlana in 2004 first match . so what do you feel about this tournament ?
svetlana seemed to be getting annoyed with the crowd up at the top . did you find that it affected your game at all ?
when she was complaining , did you just have to try to drop that out of your game ? was it affecting your game ?
can you talk about the conditions out there , the wind , the sand ? i do n't know what it was like for you ?
what about your own game ? what did n't go right today ?
is the court surface causing any problems like grip or something ?
the round robin system gives you a chance of staying in the tournament . are you still optimistic that you can progress ?
you 've talked about changes you 've made in your personal and coaching life . but what kind of changes did you refer to , strategic or technical ? i mean , are you making changes in your game or how you play ?
like changes in patterns that you 're playing on the courts or what do you mean ?
can you just talk about having the tournament in this part of the world ? do you think that 's a good thing , is that a positive thing , a negative thing ?
i mean more in terms of women 's rights and that sort of thing ?
pretty strong performance .
we did n't see one smile on the court today . was it because you were tense , or the conditions were really tough ?
you 'd lost to ana in your last five meetings . was that becoming a major concern for you in terms of bragging rights within serbia ?
if you beat in an easily way in my opinion a player like ivanovic , your real opponent for next year in your mind is serena , is sharapova or which one ?
your opponent when she was here earlier also complained about the conditions being difficult and windy , et cetera . but an extra disadvantage that she felt was that she was dehydrated ?
yes , she was dehydrated . you obviously were n't suffering from those affects . what more can you do to combat these conditions the next time out ?
when you become world no.1 before a tournament like this instead of during it , it means that everybody 's talking about it and telling you about it and reminding you of it .
about being no.1 .
it 's a help rather than a hindrance , is it ?
so you actually feel different on the court , do you ?
so does that make you feel that you can win here or do you still take it just match by match ?
you said earlier that you smiled a couple of times at your coach when you did what he told you to do . what specifically had he told you to do ?
ana made the point before that she could detect a greater degree of confidence on the other side of the net . does that work both ways ? did you detect that she perhaps was n't as confident about beating you as she had been in the past ?
do you feel it 's good that you can impose yourself more from the no.1 position on your rivals for that status ?
you say you do n't really think about what your opponent is thinking , you 're just focusing on yourself . let me ask you a personal question , do you sleep at night wondering about who your next opponent 's going to be and what the future is ?
you you talk about vacation . where ?
you must be disappointed to lose when you 've played so well ?
what happened at 5-3 ?
you have defeated jelena a lot of times before . you think since roland garros she 's improved her game ?
just back on the trainer , was it breathing problems ? was it related to dust in the air ?
secondly , are conditions like this easier for a player that tends to keep the ball in play and away from mistakes , rather than someone who is going to be attacking and trying to hit winners ?
will you take any precautions to prevent a repeat of what happened , not feeling well ? is there anything you can do ?
was the wind difficult ?
but you still feel that you can qualify , do you ?
tennis is supposed to be a sport that 's played outdoors , but you 've all been indoors since the us open , really . so is it kind of strange to have this tournament , which is the biggest tournament of the tour suddenly going outdoors again after you 've been indoors for a couple of months ?
where would you rather play tennis , indoors or outdoors ?
you were very unlucky in that you got to world no.1 and then you got the injury , but you fought your way back . do you feel your level is basically back to where it was before you became no.1 ?
have you been watching a little bit of vera playing today and how do you see tomorrow 's match ?
you said that you feel that jelena is more confident on the court . how do you feel that on the court that she 's more confident ?
congratulations on winning your fifth title here , serena . it proved to be lucky no.7 in terms of closing out the match . can you talk about the emotions that you went through as you watched the first six match points evaporate before your very eyes ?
when you smashed the racquet , that 's something we do n't normally see you do . what took you to that point ?
looked like you .
talk about the emotions . talk about the emotional swings . obviously from the first set to the second set to the match points , can you describe what that was like ?
she said you looked nervous out there . is that even possible considering you have been playing tennis your whole life ?
does it surprise you to get tight , serena ? is that something you do n't expect from yourself ?
is it just you 're thinking you 're this close to winning , it 's three points away ? i mean , we have n't been in that situation . you know , what are you going through at that point that would make you do that ?
you get distracted ?
when you turned around and sort of took your head in your hands , what were you telling yourself when you 're sort of collecting yourself there ?
aside from the racquet smashing , you seemed to play much more calmly , very little screaming . seemed to be a different serena out there .
is the weather a factor at all when it 's so hot and humid , eagerness to be done with the job ? does that make the fuse even shorter and the frustration greater ?
this tournament obviously , you know , five titles ; you obviously feel very comfortable here . you just keep winning .
the fact that you still get tight in a match like this even after all your wins and all your experiences , is that a reflection of your desire level at this point ?
people always ask you , when was the last time you were this fit ? i 'd like to ask , when is the last time you wanted it this much and were this focused ?
how far back do you think you 've come to your very best level ? is it possible to assess that or not ?
of course to us it seems like you 've ' had other diversions and were n't really putting out as much serena that could be there . now have you come to the decision that you could become one of the greatest players of all time and just to settle on doing that ?
have you put all the other stuff aside then : acting , fashion , all those things ?
why did you make that decision , serena , to sort of put that stuff on the back burner ?
given the degree you can dominate out there and the start you had , were you surprised that she hung in there as well as she did for as long as she did ?
the green clay and then the red clay in europe , you 're home now , how hard is it to change over ? i think you 're skipping amelia but going to play charleston .
will you go up to amelia and practice ?
is jelena more unpredictable than others ?
unpredictable in terms of you never know what you 're going to get .
what was your reaction to the crowd today , and did it help or hurt either one of you ?
this steady focus on tennis , was that something that came within you , or did you talk to others about that , or how did that form itself ?
big support from your box today , serena . your dad and the exuberant looking lady sitting next to him with the gold hat and everything . did you draw a lot of support from that support today ?
you look at american women 's tennis and there 's you and venus and nothing else .
there was a point where serena was serving 1-love in the third set . i think it was 15-30 , and it was a long point . you missed a forehand at the end that i thought you were going to make , and i think you lost several points in a row afterward . did that feel like a turning point ?
how bad did you feel at the start of the third set when you called for the trainer and the doctor ?
during the medical timeout you put something in your nose .
you never thought about defaulting at all ?
it was a crazy match . were you laughing at yourself , looked as though .
your resolve even from love-3 down in the second set and then love-5 down in the third set , your resolve never wavered at all . how did you find it in yourself to keep fighting ?
serena has home court advantage here , but did you really feel the fans and the crowd rooting for you , especially late in the second set ?
all of the unforced errors , especially at the end , was that a combination of fatigue and nerves ? do you think both of those two things affected you ?
both of you , actually . quite a few .
what does it feel like when serena , when she 's coming and she 's going to do one of those overheads and she starts growling ?
on the women 's tour is there anyone like her ? is she really unique in that way with just the power and the aura ?
but jelena , you do handle some of her heavy balls very well , and i 'll ask the opposite questions .
what does it feel like though when you do return one well ? does it feel like you 're swatting concrete or a missile ? what does it feel like ?
what were the pills that you were taking during that changeover ?
you took a couple of pills .
she screamed a little , but did n't you feel that she was overall much calmer than she usually is ?
she 's usually screaming all the time .
a couple of weeks ago in dubai you said a couple of things . one , that you 're not really fit enough to go beyond the two-hour mark . well , it went 2 hours 25 today , and in those 25 minutes you caused her a lot of problems . the other thing was that you really need a full-time traveling coach with you to bring out your best . is there any update on either of those things ?
has the person who 's been helping you with that become the full-time coach ?
and who was that ?
you said at the end , you know , that you really had never seen her that nervous or whatever at the end and smashing the racquet , so upset .
but did you feel at that point that maybe she was vulnerable and you maybe had a chance there ?
what a superb match . it was probably worthy of a final . you must be very satisfying for you to come out on top having dug so deep ?
talk about the back injury and when you felt you were moving better . looked like the second set .
do you recall which shot or movement it was ?
is that why you were serving like in the 90s and holding back on your serve in the first set ?
yeah .
was this a match where mental toughness was really what it was all about to win this ?
what about the fitness factor ? nearly three hours , hot afternoon , and you seemed to be strong at the end .
talk about the regimen you did since the australian to get into such good shape .
specifically ?
you said in the past you have a home court advantage here . did you get any kind of a charge in the third set ?
at the start of the second set you were two breakpoints down , and you held onto that service game , and you held serve for the rest of that set and then broke kuznetsova to win the set . i mean , obviously holding onto that first service game was crucial , was n't it ?
it seemed like early on you were having problems with the forehand . what improved with that and just kind of what were you doing or not doing ?
you moved very well in the third set . is that kind of really a physical thing or mental thing because now you 're really into the match ?
you always say facing venus is the toughest thing for you . what 's it like facing an opponent that just beat your sister ?
after you played so well against justine , was it tough to overcome what might be seen as a natural letdown ?
did that ten-minute heat break help you guys ? seemed like you both broke each other a lot right after the break .
do you and venus talk about the match before ?
was that a dinner table discussion for you or casually driving to the tournament ?
how do you guys seem to escape the natural sibling rivalry ? you say you want to win for venus . i mean , that 's not the normal .
with this being one of your favorite tournaments , what would it mean for to you win it back to back ?
you said it was one of your favorite tournaments here . even though it 's not a grand slam , what would it mean to win it back to back ?
are you focused on your next opponent , possibly jankovic or zvonareva ?
will you watch the match tonight ?
are you thinking that this is the fifth time ? and why did you change to wear the hat ?
what about the fifth time ?
i think you 're going to play charleston but not amelia ?
how important is that event as a jump off to the red clay in europe , or are they so dissimilar surfaces ?
you 've seen how tough it is to be ranked no.1 and be down lower and having to meet seeds early on . do people really appreciate how difficult it is to fight your way to a title from , say , no.8 or 9 seeds than it is form the no.1 position ?
is the green clay a good jump off for the red clay , or are they so dissimilar ?
matches like the one you had with justine where everything was working and the match today where everything was n't working particularly well from the start , is there some satisfaction from overcoming that and gutting it out ?
were you frustrated by the number of breakpoint opportunities that you let slip ? you converted 5 out of 16 .
seemed like you really played well . controlled the match most of the way . where do you feel like you let it slip away ?
did you sense she was injured at all ? she had a back injury timeout . she was n't serving hard the first set .
just how tough is it to play venus and then serena or serena and then venus ? how tough is it to play the two williams sisters back to back ?
were nerves a factor at all ? it seemed like there were a few times you had breakpoint chances or game points where you kind of blew what looked like you should have put a shot away .
what 's the big difference mentally and emotionally between playing serena and justine ?
what happened at match point ? the second set you had kind of a floating volley and you netted it . you were n't sure what to do with that one , or ...
were you trying to bring her in with the backhand slice to the net ?
it was nice to see , you know , long women 's match going almost three hours . how were you feeling physically ? you said before you like playing somebody like serena where you have to reach to the top .
looking back , do you think it was a smart decision to play doubles here ?
when she broke you in the eighth game of the third set , she did a backhand off the net and it kind of clipped the net and you kind of netted the next one . was that just a tough break ?
you did n't play too much tennis today . good for the future ?
you looked really focused . she looked like she was scrambling about and having a hard time catching up with you . you looked very poised and in control . is that how it felt ?
do you take medicine for that ?
does that have any side effect on you ? sometimes that can maybe slow a person down .
what 's the difference in your tournament this year here as opposed to the past years ?
did you sense that she was injured out there ?
do you remember the last break ? she had a pretty easy swinging volley , but she did n't put it away and you passed her with a backhand down the line .
but my point is : do you feel that just took the heart out of her and she said , hey , i might as well bag it . my back hurts . she got that break , it 's like 3-1 .
basically you 're saying you 're going to fight to the death ? you 're out there to win ?
the match the other night that went past midnight , you talked a little afterward , but how much confidence -- that took a lot out of you physically ?
did you feel that it was a rather unlucky with the scheduling here , that you played that tough match and then you were on again so quickly ?
did you get the call before or after you wore the cellphone dress ?
did you have the cold before or after you wore the cellphone ...
no , i said , did you have a cold before or after you wore the cellphone dress ?
how about your next opponent ? preference ? you played them both , i 'm sure . talk about safina and zvonareva ?
dementieva said she thought you could carry this and win . what do you think needs to happen for you to be able to do that ?
are you trying to beef up your serve at all ? seems like you could beef it up a little .
how would you describe that dress ? i 've never seen a dress made of cellphones .
did it make a tone , dial tone ?
did it make a noise ?
you 're building your dream house in san diego . what is your dream house ? what makes it your dream house ?
what kind of cars do you have ? i know you like fast cars . i read it somewhere .
do you ever speed ?
is that house a big achievement for you just in the context of your life ?
when did the injury start occurring ? is it the lower back ? is that what you 're talking about ?
so before you even stepped on court today you were concerned about it ?
how did it hinder you out there ? just in every shot or just certain shots ?
was the double fault or just the score of the match just kind of the final breaking point to say , it 's not worth it anymore today or what kind of finally caused you to ...
how many hours of , like , medical treatment did you get in the last day , since it hurt you ? like what did you do to try to get on the court ?
is this a recurring injury ? is this new this year ?
jelena 's been storming through this tournament . what impressed you the most about the way she played you today ?
what specifically though makes you think she can make a run and win the whole thing ?
do you feel like you two almost have identical games ? neither one has a really strong serve , but you both have like wonderful baseline strokes . is it very similar to jelena ?
how disappointed are you in today ?
today 's performance reminded everybody of your performance last year when you took maria sharapova apart at a similar stage , and then you reminded everybody afterwards that you always expect the best of yourself . today you were pretty near your best , were n't you ?
is there a tournament anywhere else in the world where you feel as comfortable and sort of as much as , this is my place ?
what was the big difference today compared to three performances against the last two ?
so many people here at the tournament have been buzzing about just how good you look physically on the court . you 've not looked this good since ... can you finish that sentence ?
serious question .
you talked about when you came in about how you 've been practicing a lot more than usual . like how much more ? how hard have you really been working for this ?
last time i heard you say you practiced like a champ was before the australian last year when you were starting from a lower fitness point .
were you surprised at how easy it was today ? did it cross your mind ?
since beating justine here in the final last year , you 've lost to her in the whole series of marquis quarterfinals in the grand slams . i guess today was payback day , was n't it ?
if your sister wins tonight you would play . you played back in india . last time on a big , big stage was us open in '05 . seems like it 's been a while .
was it ?
has it gotten easier or harder to play her over the years ?
she 's stepped up the speed of her serve a little bit , both first and second . your service returns today you had a number of winning service returns or forcing returns . can you comment ?
no , justine .
justine stepped up her serve quite a lot . little more pace on the ball . but your service returning today was pretty extraordinary . can you comment on that a bit ?
is that because you were reading her serve better today ?
when you talk about errors going from 60 to 15 or whatever , how would you explain it ? is it just focus , or ...
justine said she was lacking courage today against you . what do you think it says about you ?
will you still go and watch venus ' match tonight even though you may be on a collision course ?
do you think there 's anything she can throw at you that you have n't seen ?
back on justine for a second . we perhaps overlooked today a couple of winning lobs by you . how much more variety is in your game today than , say , to even one year ago ?
you were also coming in a lot to the net more than justine . i think it 's about double the amount you came into the net than justine .
is it also because venus , last year she was kind of working on a transition game , coming to the net more ? you saw at the us open . is it like you 're following in her footsteps or ...
one of your former neighbors , andy roddick , got himself engaged yesterday . what is your reaction to that ?
you know her ?
is there any way that you or venus would stay in the game longer than the other ? do you have any kind of an understanding that it 's going to be the same time when you decide to leave the game ?
that would be very different , though , would n't it ?
i do n't know . you tell me . i know you came into the game a bit later .
alzheimer 's ?
so what do you still want to achieve in those three years ?
where do you want to be at the end of the year in terms of rankings , and are you still looking to get back to no.1 and dominate again the way you did once ?
how do you assess the match , justine ?
were you surprised she was coming in a lot ?
are you bothered by the conditions at all ?
was she any different than , you know , the last three times you had played her ? do you feel that she 's maybe playing better this year so far ?
are you worried about your form this season , maybe ?
are you mentally maybe still processing everything you did last season ?
can you just kind of clarify , are you setting up some sort of base in florida , or is that just lending your name to a facility ?
as the match progressed , what things did you try to do to get your backhand , recover your backhand ?
did you try to do some different things , like putting more air under the ball ?
is there something about when you play her here ? is there anything about this particular venue ? obviously you beat her in other places , but last year here , also . is it just the conditions ? is it she 's close to home ?
do you feel like you were playing too defensively or she was making you play too much defense ?
do you remember the last time you lacked courage ?
is it because maybe you have n't played much of your top tennis yet this year that you 're maybe playing a little bit too defensive , or like you say , lacking courage ?
a lot of attention is paid to players like maria sharapova , ana ivanovic and the williams sisters , particularly in a venue like this in miami where there 's a lot of glitz and glamour involved . you seem to shy away from that . do you think that more attention should be paid strictly to the game as the no.1 player , or is there something you prefer not to be in the spotlight ?
there was a bit of a rough patch with the serves and the double faults . what was going on there and how did you overcome it ?
if serena wins today you 'll meet her , i guess in the quarters . can you talk about the challenge of playing her ? i know you guys have had back and forth . i know she won the final last year . i think you won the last three .
talk about her .
i know you do n't like to get ahead , but let 's say you won that one . then you might have to face her sister . is it a similar type of game when you face one from the other , or how are they different , their games ?
things did n't go so well today ?
is the back okay ?
you 've played an awful lot of matches against great players , so this is probably a silly question , but did you feel any sort of shock , letdown after going home last night and saying , yeah , i beat ivanovic ?
you have a lot of perspective on the tour . you 've been around , seen a lot of great players make their rise . can you talk about the williams sisters and what has made them endure so long ? they won seven out of the last ten , one of the two , this tournament .
can you put them in one , lump them into one category ? i 'm saying williams sisters . they each have different things that make them special .
coming into this tournament , what were you kind of thinking ? you know , after yesterday people were saying , lindsay , maybe you have a shot here to win . what were you thinking ?
speaking about other sporting moms who have been inspiring to you . are you familiar with paula radcliffe ?
she came back and won the new york marathon .
is that the sort of story i guess that you can relate to ?
do you ever like dara torres is down here . she 's 41 and has a baby . and sybille bammer , since you 're the only ones on the women 's tour , have you talked or anything ...
really ? you have n't made a play date ?
no mom 's club , no play dates ?
despite losing today , do you feel like yesterday 's win over ana was kind of a notch on your belt in your comeback ?
are you following the ncaa ? are you a basketball fan ?
grass is a surface which invariably challenges a lot of the more younger inexperienced players . do you feel comfortable going in ? are you looking forward going back to wimbledon ?
do you feel like you did something important when you played in qatar ?
last year i also did a story on you , and you told me that you 're trying to become more aggressive , you said , to improve my serve so i can use my slice and come into the net . you said it takes time . talk about that . i know i did n't see you coming in . i do n't know if you came in at all . maybe . but talk about that part of your game .
when , exactly , did you change coaches ?
maybe other people know , but how do you spell the last name so i get it right ?
no , your coach .
and your dad 's here now ?
he 's here . does that help a lot ? does it help to have him here with you ?
i want to talk a little bit , because last year she was also seeded 3 ; you were on the small court . you remember all the circumstances . it looked like you won the first set , and then she was coming on strong . in the third set she had this 3-0 , and all of a sudden , the crowd got stronger for you , and then you win that . do you feel that crowd 's going to make a difference if they 're going to be here the next match ?
do you know if that 's going to be tomorrow ?
do you prefer it that way ?
you recognize a lot of faces because you 're going to see a lot of people in the crowd . i saw them from the reception that we had for you the other night . there was a lot of people that came out . they said it 's good to see her again . so i 'm glad that you 're building up that proud support . what do you think of this tournament in particular ?
that was a close one , huh ?
when you get down to your last breath like that , do you start thinking back to the vaidisova match or other matches where you had to dig down ?
you know , jelena had lots of trouble last night .
she had a comeback big time last night , too . they 're after you guys .
do you think it 's because there 's more moisture in the air here ? this is much more humid .
the toughness that you found today , i know you 've had a little bit of trouble in finals lately , is that something that you need to sort of fine tune so that you 're bringing that out in yourself when it really counts in a final ?
have you ever worked with a sports psychologist or anyone to work with you ?
you were down 3-5 to vaidisova , but you came back from that one , too . is there a mentality that once you 've come back in a big match at a big tournament , it 's easy to do the next time ?
when you won this tournament a couple years ago , i mean , the conditions here from year to year do n't change that much .
i 'm sorry ?
that was the difference , just the fatigue ?
when you got here the weather was n't quite like this . it was a little cooler , so you really did n't have much time to get used to this , did you ?
will you be ready in two days ?
tomorrow ?
will you be ready tomorrow ?
when you walked in here , you were walking very slowly .
except when you 're dancing though , right ?
not even to hip-hop ?
the humidity it 's similar to spain , is n't it ?
here ?
so next it 's either , is it azarenka ? radwanska ?
larcher de brito .
you had never played lindsay before . was that a factor in what happened today ? did she do things that surprised you ?
her service returns are so good . does that affect you ? make you serve a little closer to the line ? take more risks ?
what about your fatigue after indian wells ? is that still a factor ?
does it give you an appreciation of how difficult it is for the really tennis players like federer , say , to do it back-to-back , given your experience in the last week ?
when you say you 'll learn , you 'll take a couple more days off or something like that ?
you say you 're still learning , but yet you 're already no.2 in the world . what do you feel it says about your potential that you 're still learning , but you 're already ranked so high ?
so there is nothing but to look forward to the clay season now . do you have to do some particular off-court work to strengthen your body for the clay season before you go out there and start playing ?
what will be your clay court schedule ?
how about the ankle ? it 's still tight , is n't it ?
about the clay court season , last year you obviously made your big breakthrough on the clay court season , but yet you 're typically a power player . did it surprise you that you made kind of your big break on clay ?
it 's been quite a similar story with you and novak in the last ten days at indian wells . then quite a few commitments and having to back it up here . have you talked at all about it ? did you talk to each other following indian wells or in the week leading up to this ?
for dutch tennis magazine , what can you tell me about your partnership with sven groenefeld , because you 're always so positive about him ?
but is n't it strange for you that maybe sven is also involved with other players ? he 's not just coaching you , but he 's coaching maybe your competitors in a way , you know ?
did you talk with sven after the final at roland garros about what happened ?
but you do n't feel that maybe you need like someone with you all the time ? someone who can coach you in every match ? because i can imagine , it 's like you said , it 's weird that sometimes you face an adidas player and you ca n't have coaching .
i have a question about lindsay . watching her , she took time out to start a family . all the time it takes to come back and playing well and what she did today . do you kind of look at her and say , as a woman , i can have that kind of balance in my life ? i can have children . i can still be a tennis champion .
you 're a very gracious loser as well as being a gracious winner .
have you always been that way when you were younger , or was it harder for you to come after a match and smile ?
if you did n't know that lindsay was ranked number 33 coming into this match , what would you have thought her ranking would be after this match ?
if you did n't know lindsay was ranked 33 based on her performance today , what would you have guessed her ranking would be ?
how does the weight of her shot compare to the real big hitters at the moment ?
so another good serving performance . maybe a little better in the first set than the second ?
at this time of the day , around noon , the sun is very high . was it a problem today ?
her second serve , if i may be kind , is not so great . but sometimes is n't it amazing how easy it looks to hit , and you wind up not hitting the ball the way you want to sometimes ?
did it begin to bother you that these second serves are so easy to hit , and you were hitting some wide , some out ?
harkleroad , venina , still out there fighting away . you 've played jelena twice at grand slams and fairly easy matches for you .
what are the things that 's vesnina does that are dangerous for you ?
feels good today ?
do you feel like this career comeback just keeps gaining momentum ?
what gives you more satisfaction : to win a title where , you know , they 're are top ranked players around or to beat no.2 in the world ?
how many balls did you hit within an inch of her baseline ?
lindsay , you won 13 of 14 net points . that might be about as perfect a performance that you 've had .
when you were having your greatest years , and not that you 're not going to have another ...
but there was an intimidation factor that you had , that no one wanted to face that serve or those groundstrokes . did you feel a little of that intimidation factor against her today ?
ana said she thought you were a top 10 player today . do you feel like you are at this point ?
do you ever wish you could transplant the attitude you have now into the body of ten years ago ?
do you have safina next ?
you have n't played her in a couple of years .
how is this stadium court different from other courts , if it is different ?
can you talk about basically just the work/life balance that you 've had ? to be able to take the time off and start a family and say , i can come back . i can be great again , you know .
how great would it be if you could still be playing when jagger 's old enough to understand what 's going on ?
you 'll have videotapes of the matches .
i do n't know how many times you 've been asked this , but what is the biggest difference between the players you 're facing now and the players you faced when you first started coming up in the pro ranks ?
your husband said he wants you to --
it was actually what you said . you said your husband said he wants you to play in rome because he would like to visit .
now the question . any particular reason to play in warsaw ? because i know you 're planning an exhibition event there .
you know they traded both serbs for you because they said you 're more of an audience magnet .
but you 're taking jagger with you ?
can you talk about your next game against davenport ?
it 's going to be tomorrow , right ?
do you feel like you 're still keeping up momentum from , obviously you won indian wells , or do you feel like this is a brand-new ground , brand-new tournament ?
welcome back here .
why the long absence ?
you were never that keen on the conditions either . you were talking about the wind .
have you ever been on a hawk-eye court where the ball was called out , and in your mind there was just absolutely no question that the ball hit the line ?
the ball hit the line , and you thought it was on , but the hawk-eye proved you to be wrong ?
do you believe in the system ?
there 's a standing invitation for every player to go up to the computer room .
have you ever taken that ?
couple of people that have talked about you , mary joe and some others , said you just seem to be happier on the court since you 've become a mom . do you feel like you just have a different attitude , do you think , since you 've become a mom ?
that 's what she said . she said you used to be so angry and it cost you matches .
talk about today a little bit .
what do you do travel-wise with the baby ? do you have a babysitter that comes with you ?
is it still your plan to pretty much skip the clay court season at this point ?
would it be beneficial to have some clay court time before the fed cup ?
are you going to play doubles at the fed cup ?
what do you do when you have a great doubles player who is not particularly a great singles player , like liesl huber . you know she can play great doubles , but you feel like you might need an extra singles player ?
in la jolla you spoke about trying to convince serena and/or venus to come .
what was their reasoning ?
it 's better than moscow in january .
how many times have you seen where a younger player is playing against an opponent who gets an injury ? it 's either a giant injury or a long timeout like you had today ? then the player comes back and the unhurt player has a difficult time somehow coping with how to play with the person 's injury . you just stepped on the gas . do you have to learn how to cope with that ?
when you 're young , is there a tendency to start pushing against that player that 's hurt ?
how much were the olympics a factor in your decision to come back ?
how much of that is genetics ?
you 've talked in the past about the thrill of the opening ceremony in atlanta . what about winning the gold medal , where does that rank in your career highlights ?
do you think the olympic team for america might be a little bit different than the fed cup team ?
how about ashley ? she 's the one stepping up to the plate now .
will you take on ana ivanovic if that 's what happens ?
on a day like today , you 've won your match now , now will you get to spend the rest of the day with your son ? how do you parcel out the time so you can get rest and also be with him ?
he sleeps through the night ? you do n't wake up with him or anything ?
you 've been making all the self-corrections that you made on court . what is it you want adam to do for you at this stage ?
the way you were cracking off aces today suggests that maybe you 've been perhaps putting in a little bit more time with your serve .
are you going for a little bit more on your first serve because you 're hitting so well ?
and you averaged 110 miles an hour on your first serve today ; does that surprise you ?
about your camp , why did you choose florida over california or somewhere else ? and how might your camp differ in the way you bring juniors along ?
in the states they 're doing a big push for what the usta calls `` quick start '' with the mini tennis and the junior tennis . europe 's been doing that for a long time . you 'll incorporate that ?
when you 're hitting your first serve as well as you were today , does it help you gain confidence to go for more with your second serve as well ?
how tough was it to come back in the third set , literally after getting a bagel in the second ?
what do you feel you did well in the first and third set that maybe you were n't doing in the second ?
is this the longest match you played ?
can you talk a little bit about your next match with venus and about the australian ?
are you going to do anything tonight ? will you rest a little longer tonight after a match like this ?
you mentioned those unforced errors . how do you think you overcame those during the match ?
the unforced errors , you had a lot of them . how did you overcome that to still win ?
can you talk about as you go through a match like that , what do you think about ? do you ever realize , geez , this is going on for a while ?
what are some of those thousand thoughts ?
how did you pull out that second set ?
your general feeling ?
give us a sense of how you feel .
what 's most exciting , no.1 or the title ?
do you recall or have you ever gone through a major tournament winning every single set throughout the tournament ?
your father said he thought this title meant more to you than any of the others , perhaps . is the joy greater when you have to wait for something ?
you really put your nose to the grindstone all year , working , working , working , and at times you liked the results but i do n't know you were n't that thrilled about your results at the majors . it must feel good you finally put the work in and can sit back and say , yeah .
having won eight titles before this tournament , i mean , you 've had great moments . now that you 've had tonight , can you say if you had never had another win , another grand slam win , would your career have felt somehow lacking ? i mean , i guess , can you just frame this title ?
tough loss at wimbledon . does this make up for it ? and also , talk about the williams family triple this summer between wimbledon , beijing and ...
they were saying on tv just how positive of an influence common has been on you and kind of telling you , this is really your moment . can you just talk about how he 's kind of influenced you .
how much motivation do you take from people , including chris evert , saying that you had spread your energies too thin and that you were never going to be the greatest player you could be if you did n't have a single-minded focus on tennis ? how motivating was that for you to prove these people wrong ?
in '99 you win your first title ; you 're hitting people off the court . probably not as conscious of what was happening as you are now . do you enjoy these things ? do they mean more as an adult , because you 've been through a lot more than you were nine years ago ?
people are really excited hearing that there 's a possibility that you and venus might be coming back to new york to play in the billie jean king cup in madison square garden in march .
that might have been your best match point celebration .
what fed it , do you think ?
you 're no.1 now , serena . if you have to keep this , you probably have to contend with venus . i mean , going by performance this year , the one who is most likely to challenge you for no.1 . will you be looking forward to that challenge ?
do you still enjoy the battle on court , because obviously you were out there against her and she 's pushing everything back and it seems like a war . is there enjoyment in that ?
this is such an incredible win tonight , but beijing was pretty special , too . can you possibly talk about the two victories and just the different nuances and different feelings ?
what is the biggest factor behind your resurgence ?
what 's next for you tennis-wise , business-wise , fun-wise ?
since this was the 40th anniversary , was there some weight of expectation to do something ? they talked about the men not doing so well .
and the men ?
if you had to wrap the whole two-week experience coming to new york , emerging , triumph , in one or two words or a phrase , what would it be ?
because ?
is nine enough for you ?
in spite of the loss , this must be an improvement in your grand slam resume .
this is definitely an improvement in your grand slam ...
could you feel that she was a little tired in the second set ?
since you have never gotten to this point before , what about this tournament and about this final in particular and you learned from for the next time ?
serena says she 's playing more consistently now because she 's playing more . do you see that ? is it harder to catch her on a bad night now than it used to be ?
do you feel if you had slam-final experience in the past the result could have been different ?
on what you just said , physically it 's been a very tough year for you . how are you feeling now ?
okay . out there on court you 're sighing , you 're smiling , you 're laughing . you said that your personality suites this tournament . what 's the one thing in your personality that clicks with this tournament ?
maybe best supporting actress ?
since '95 , the us open final never went to the third set , and today you were , very close .
you went very , very close to it . four set points ; the fourth was a double fault . the double fault was the point that you missed when you were close to 6-all and the tiebreaker . why that happens ? tension ?
still , it was a great match .
given this is your first grand slam singles final , what pleased you most about your performance tonight ?
during changeovers when a lot of players are very focused , you 're looking at the tv screen .
is that something you do to relax ?
did you really not know how much the runner-up check is ?
mary carrillo said that you enjoyed watching television , especially when you 're on television . do you have any thoughts about that ?
the tv screen .
you said in the past that your mother obviously has a hard time sometimes with , you know , what goes on out there . what did she say to you afterwards ?
at one point in the second set of the match , i 'm not sure just which point , you turned around and you looked at the crowd as if you were trying to see who was yelling down at you . did they make you lose your rhythm then at that point ?
i do n't know what you were looking for , but you were looking up .
the no.1 position was at stake . if you had your choice , what would you --
no.1 position was at stake , the us open title obviously ...
what was the vaccine for ?
after the championship match of the us open you got this ?
is it a little strange to get this shot right after you come off the us open final ?
are you going to take a long break after this or get right back to work ?
what 's the difference between the serena williams who sort of came out of the blue , won the australian open in 2007 and the serena williams who 's played a lot more consistently in the last little while ?
what does that mean , putting in the effort ?
was this match as easy as the scores indicate ?
can you describe the way you were when you won your first grand slam here in '99 ? how long ago does that feel compared to where you are now , mentally , physically ?
what 's different about the way you approach the points , the way you approach your game now ?
what about 2002 ?
do you feel expected to win tomorrow ?
did you ever doubt that you would get back to this point ?
it was awfully windy out there today , but how cleanly do you feel you 're hitting the ball right now ?
did you get your rhythm in today 's match , or ...
can you talk about that point where you struck safina with that drive ?
are you concerned about weather conditions for the match tomorrow , if it 's going to be tomorrow ?
would you say a quarterfinal match was a lot harder than the semifinals ?
you mentioned this after you played her , that if you 're going to eliminate her from the tournament , you really want to go on and win it to make it worthwhile . is that pretty much the case ?
if you become no.1 , it will have been five years since you were no.1 . no other woman has come back and done that after such a long time . what kind of statement do you think that makes about your career ?
did you warm up with venus this morning , and did she give you any advice for this match ?
talk a little bit more specifically about what you mean by just putting in the effort . i mean , are you talking about practicing more or working out more ?
can you talk a little bit about the advice that venus gave you ? it was about dinara ?
any particular reads on dinara that she gave ?
the last time you and jelena played in miami , her tenacity really kept her in that match . is that her biggest weapon , just being able to hang in there in rallies and hang in there and hang in there ?
can you describe your will on the court in big matches , big points , big tournaments like this one ?
your will .
mary carrillo was on the air talking about how the people closest to you in your life , your family , have really encouraged you to take advantage of this prime of your career and really go for it now as opposed to maybe doing other things in life . can you talk about that a little bit ? is there someone close to you or in your family who 's really kind of encouraged you right now ?
what was that like to be part of that hbo documentary with that experience with all those amazing people from all walks of life ?
do you want to catch steffi graf ? do you think that 's at all possible ? i know you 're a little bit far behind as far as 22 grand slams .
you said the other day you really wanted to play safina . is that because she was kind of the hottest player this summer and you wanted to match up against her ?
following up on the documentary , have you seen it ? and if you have , was there one person 's story that you were struck by that you just maybe did n't know about ?
i guess you know your story , so ...
good match despite the conditions .
did you enjoy the match , in spite of the conditions ?
you were talking about not being too fit coming into this match , especially your quarters where you had 20 % but you had to manage your energy as best as you can . what was the situation today ?
how would you assess serena 's play today ?
looking back to the summer , how much are you satisfied with your results ?
do you remember your first match with serena at the us open a couple years ago ?
does this amaze you , safina , that when you 're winning and doing better at big tournaments they refer to marat as safina 's brother , and when he 's doing very well they refer to you as marat 's sister . it becomes a reference point for each other depending on who is playing better .
what were you going to get a degree in when you almost made a mistake by going back to university ?
of course you are . what do you think it would have been ?
you 're pretty good at that .
in all your tries to get past the semifinal , what was the difference today ?
that was a battle of mental strength today and you won it .
in a strange way , have your physical problems helped you build mental strength in the sense that you know that you can battle through that so you could also battle through ...
can you take us through the injuries from the very beginning ?
abbreviated version .
back side .
i 'm sure you heard about the possibility of a lot of rain tomorrow . would you rather have the extra day if you push it back to sunday ?
if you play serena williams , how does your history against her where you 've split six matches , you 've split the two matches this year , all the ...
what has been the difference when you 've played serena since you 've split those matches ? what has been the key when you 've played against her ?
when you 've won or when you 've lost , what 's been the difference ?
having spent so much time at nick 's , do you regard the united states as sort of a second country ?
when novak struggles with hostile crowds , and of course he had an issue with that last night , how important is it for you to be loved out there on court ?
did you see the on-court interview ?
what were those guys in the balcony shouting ? they were for you . i mean , it was sort of like a cheering squad .
yeah , upstairs .
when she pushed at you today , you responded well , no nerves . you played offense when you had to . defense , you got past this stage . grand slam final you 've never experienced , so just talk about how you think you 're going to hold up .
if you play serena , the winner will be no.1 in the world as far as i understand . if you play safina , even if you lose , you are going to be no.1 in the world . does it make a difference ? and also , you lost to safina three times out of four , and you are even with serena .
yes .
three out of four . three out of five .
anyway , does n't matter . not so important . would you prefer to play to serena because you 're on even ...
when you were at bollettieri 's , you were a little kid .
okay , kid .
when you 're having those battles on the back locals with sharapova and all those people , did you ever think , i ca n't do this . it 's just too tough .
yeah , yeah .
you just said you were just a little kid , and obviously you love still to joke and have fun . so many players on the circuit start as teenagers . they 're happy , they 're bubbly , but slowly they get more serious .
how important is it for you for you to have ...
do you think it 's too bad that novak has stopped pretty much doing these imitations which brought so much fun to so many people ?
were you ever concerned today when she started the match quite aggressively ?
what about the weather conditions ? did they affect your game at all today ?
are you concerned that it 's the same conditions for tomorrow or the day after ?
you had a pretty rough run in the last game or so with unforced errors . reflecting on that , i mean , how do you feel about how that happened ? what was going on in your mind at the time ?
do you think it was not possible to win the olympics and to win this back to back ?
how frustrating is it to lose a match like that ? we know jelena is a great retriever , but given you were dictating so many of the rallies .
how frustrating is it when she steps away when you 're about to serve ?
given that you won the olympics , if that had n't happened , would you have been more disappointed today ? would this have been more of a goal ?
what 's the most difficult thing about playing her ? you said before that you needed to be aggressive .
you 've had such a wonderful career over many , many years . do you think there would be something missing in your career after all this effort and all the great wins ?
would something be missing if you did not have a grand slam win ?
are you pleased with the way you played today ?
you 're going to face somebody with the name williams in the next round . we do n't know which one . neither one of them have lost a set in this tournament . your thoughts on playing either venus or serena ?
you had an opportunity to play serena on a number of occasions . you have n't played venus , have you ?
what does she bring to a tennis match that is unique ? i mean , what 's unique about playing her ?
yeah .
i was talking to nick bollettieri , who has worked with both venus and serena the other day , and he says one of the distinctive things about them - and it came from their father - they were trained at a very young age that there 's no such thing as a ball that is out of play . it 's simply is not out of play . you must go get it . i mean , did you sense that playing serena ? obviously you have n't played venus . but serena ?
how much have you watched of venus ? you ca n't speak from the perspective of having played her . how much have you watched her ? what do you think about the way she plays ?
do you feel mentally fresh now ? are you able to put aside being tired ?
so now that you have the experience this summer , when you get to this stage of the tournament , you almost see that the body 's not so important anymore . it 's more in the mind .
do you think there might come a point in the semifinals - obviously you 'll play serena or venus , so the crowd will be with them - where you 'll feel nerves , or are you past that point now ?
it will never be like that again .
what happened today ? did she just play too well or were you a bit nervous ?
what makes her so good ? is it her power ? is it just her power that makes her so strong ?
what was it like being in the first grand slam quarterfinal for you ?
was it frustrating today , or did you just did n't have a chance to get into the match ?
her first set was n't very good today . she only had like 57 , 58 % success rate .
was there any chance for you to use that to your advantage ?
how do you think dinara will do in the semifinals and onwards ?
first of all , just , you know , congratulations . it was a great performance tonight . do you feel really happy about the way you played the match ?
you talked about some issues with conditioning , and i know a couple of matches ago you had some leg cramps coming off ...
how hard is it when you come into a tournament , you know , you 're in a two-week tournament , and you 're not feeling 100 % to actually gain strength and a sense of good conditioning ?
to have the match moved over to louis armstrong , does that make any difference to you ?
in the next match , you 've played elena a number of times . sort of mixed results with elena . she 's coming in obviously very confident from her olympic victory and has managed in straight sets , has n't lost a set yet , actually . how tough a challenge do you think she 's going to present to you ?
and of course she is certainly one of the players that 's made a pretty good case for reaching that no.1 position you 've held before . i 've asked you this earlier in the week , but we 're getting to the point where you could retain that no.1 ranking , especially , with a victory here .
only two sets tonight . your mother was n't as nervous as the last few matches ?
so does life get any better than it is now ?
you have n't lost a set this whole tournament . is the level you 're playing right now good enough to get to the final ?
this is your third semifinal here . coming in here having not lost a set , and i 'm sure a confidence boost from your olympic gold medal , compare the way you 're playing now as opposed to the previous times that you entered the semifinal stage .
there was some confusion at wimbledon over something you said at a press conference .
have you ever been at this stage of a tournament and felt as confident ? i mean , i have to assume you 're feeling quite comfortable right now in the way that you 're playing . am i correct in my assessment ?
you 've really clicked in , it seems here , in a way that you obviously sort of never have in your career . can you identify maybe one thing that 's really made the difference ?
was there a match or tournament this year where you felt that was when you turned the corner ?
you 've been to grand slam finals and are an olympic gold medallist . do you still feel like you have another level you can get to as a competitor , or is this just a matter of you playing well and everything working ?
physical as well as mental , or just physical ?
mentally , you 've come a very long way from paris , the safina match , also ; yes ?
mentally , from dinara , you 've come a lot way from that point .
you seem to be playing also much more offensively than you have in the past , more aggressive .
there 's been a lot of talk this week about the fact that no.1 ranking has changed serve several times in year among several different women , and maybe there 's more parity this year , and with that , a lack of a single dominant player such as justine had been , and both serena and venus prior . do you think of anybody on tour right now as being a sort of dominant player on the women 's side ? and do you think those are shoes that you could possibly fill ?
do you feel you 're posed to be that player ?
you and jankovic play a fairly similar style , and you have played close before . you had a tough match in berlin . do you mentally know what kind of a big battle that will be ? you 've had some fairly easy matches now , but that will be the one where you 're really going to have to dig down deep and win it .
serena last night was very , very serious , you know , knowing that she has the quarterfinal coming up . you seem very serious . when you get to this stage of the grand slam , does all the fun stop , all the laughing stop , and there 's just you and your focus and ...
there it is .
so you 're going to smile a lot ?
so you 'll be smiling a lot on the court ?
when you talked about patience , you said you 've had to learn to be patient . have you had to learn to be patient to get the respect that you have been due as a top 5 player in the world ?
from the public , people who do n't really know you .
was it good to have a relatively short match , an easy match , considering this is such a long tournament ?
are you learning about how to conduct yourself in those long tournaments at the grand slams , maybe going to bed early or eating at different times ?
i know a year ago you were talking about how you were suffering from chronic fatigue . have you changed your diet at all to help your game ?
can we clarify what your coach told you before ?
were you really crying ?
neither of you kind of served well the first set , and it took a couple of set points to finally win the first set . you had such an incredible summer , do you think you mentally basically improved in surviving to win the matches you 're supposed to win ?
you obviously one the us open series . did amazing in beijing . do you almost see yourself as a potential favorite for this tournament ?
do you think about the no.1 ? because i guess if you get to the final and the right scenario is there you could be no.1 .
you 've had so many success this summer . does it seem like you 've been playing forever ? the hard court season is pretty hard on people , plus going china to play .
the williams sisters , not so good at the french and fantastic at wimbledon , and not so good at the olympics . how do you have any idea how they 're going to play here and what to expect from them ?
but they have n't played very well here . especially venus played much better at wimbledon . neither one has been in the finals for six years .
looking ahead to the fed cup , the final against spain , do you think you 're going to be playing ?
can you explain why you 're not playing ?
what are thinking about when the us open is finally over ? is there something you want to do , sleep or lie on the beach , sit in a cafe ?
looking ahead you might play amlie next in the quarterfinals .
you played her couple years ago and you lost in that the quarterfinal . do you feel like you have a little bit of a mental edge this time if she does come through ?
there are only two russian women left in the draw , which is the lowest total of all the grand slams this year . do you have any thoughts on why that 's happening at this tournament ?
through all the success this summer , what has been your happiest day ? has it been a match or has it been going shopping ?
marat obviously won his first grand slam here at the open . how much would it mean to make it your first one , too ?
you got off to a great start . something turned around then going into the second set . can you explain , you know , the difference out there ?
and you have played a lot of matches here . more than you 've played in any grand slam prior .
of course , which segues into my question . this has been a breakthrough year for you . you come here with , you know , a win at the pilot pen , a couple victories this season , and have gone quite far here . do you feel like this is sort of a breakthrough year for you ?
each grand slam has a very different atmosphere , a very different feel . here , in the large stadium playing , new york city , if you could just talk about your thoughts , likes and dislikes of this particular tournament , and especially having the opportunity to play in arthur ashe stadium .
as in wimbledon , she was able to take a first set from you , but you came back strong . what was the difference ? what changed out there ?
today was the first time it looked like you could really win this tournament .
how much of a goal is it of yours to regain the no.1 position ? you had it just a few weeks ago .
you talked over the course of the last week on how special that was .
you 're the 10th player that nick bollettieri has helped to the no.1 ranking . what has he meant to your career ?
what 's the key to how he succeeds ?
next opponent could be sybille bammer . could you tell us a little bit about that .
bartoli .
caroline has been moving forward very fast , and she 's top 20 now , 18. what is it she 's doing so well , and how is she as a player ?
when you were with bollettieri , how much time did you spend in schoolwork during the week and how much of that was language , english language ?
with your coach and your mom this week , have they been saying anything to the effect that you can win a grand slam , your game is there , put the injuries aside ?
at the french and at wimbledon when you had tough losses , you came in afterward and told us pretty good jokes , including the helicopter jokes . i wonder , do you actually consider humor to be an important tool for playing this tough tour ? because not a lot of players have it .
seems like new york maybe more than any other grand slam city might fit your personality the best .
it was a great performance tonight . do you feel right now that you 're really on top of your game ? are you really happy with the way things went tonight ?
there 's been a lot of conversation in this room with players that participated in beijing about sort of an olympic hangover , if you will , dealing with not only with having the great travel and the time zone changes and so forth , but also , as you said the other day , i think it was monday , you had mentioned that in a way your heart was still in beijing .
is that over with now ? are you fully locked into this tournament right now ? i mean , i 'm not saying that you can put the gold medal behind you , but is the focus there right now , do you feel ?
with ana making an early exit , there are several opportunities for women to take the top spot in the world rankings . you 're certainly one of those rankings . do you ever think about that ? how strong an objective is that for you ?
do you really feel like you have to improve ? i mean , just watching the match tonight , you missed very , very few balls from the ground . if you played at that level the next three matches , that just might be good enough .
what shots do n't you feel confident in right now ? seems like you 're confident in almost every shot .
no , except for maybe your serve to the ad court , every shot was going pretty well .
li told us that you really set the pace . do you agree that you controlled this match from start to finish ?
is there anything you did different the second half of the match ?
you 'll see patty in the next round .
your thoughts on that matchup .
i think it was 2004 you played capriati in the semis here ; is that right ?
and then do you sort of feel like that was a really good chance to win , but you were just too tired from playing the semifinal ?
what 's been the difference in this year for you ? your third year on tour and you 're having some success ?
you seemed a lot more confident and composed than she was . seemed like you handled the situation better than she did .
is that the next step for you , to trust your shots and play more aggressive in the big matches ? because you 'll have a very rough one coming out the next time against a grand slam champion .
does it help to know that you 've had success against her in the past ?
do you still get nervous in big matches ?
in your whole life ?
not so many players are like that , especially when they 're young . you can say i 'm not going to be nervous before the match , but then you get there and there 's a big crowd and it 's a big player , so ...
are you surprised at all by your success or at this point you say to yourself , i know i 'm very good , and i know i can play with these players ?
how is your success being received in poland ?
is there any extra pressure , now that you 're kind of carrying the flag for them ?
so you 've reached the top 10. do you feel like your game is to the point where you can get to the top 5 ? do you feel like there 's a big difference between top 10 and top 5 players ?
so if you take a player like venus , her ranking is n't that high but she 's won seven grand slams , what would be the difference there between her and other normal top 20 players ?
7 .
do you think experience will make a difference in your match against her , given that she 's got a lot more experience in the big tournaments ?
can you talk about that last game , 11 deuces .
is it hard to play her sometimes because she gets everything back ?
do you feel you 're playing better , the same , not so good as at wimbledon ?
did you know she 's been talking about how tired she is ? were you trying to keep the match going as long as possible to see if she was maybe ...
at wimbledon , you said you were going to give money to the victims at sichuan . have you been able to do that ?
have you done it ?
and you have given the money ?
you were going to give money .
no , no . sichuan .
you hit a flat ball . on grass it stays low . is that one reason that you prefer grass ?
once again now you 've lost to jelena in straight sets . do you feel that your game is improving ?
people say the singles draw is very open and a lot of people could win it . is it the same with the doubles ?
do you show your emotions more now , your feelings , than when you started when you were younger ? today you showed your emotions . you were happy . you were sad . maybe when you were younger you were more shy .
but sometimes today you smiled .
and sometimes you get angry , you get mad , too ?
what was the difference today in your view ?
is it harder for you -- obviously it 's never a happy moment to live in a grand slam , but with the other people who are out , who were n't here , and your history in this tournament , does it make it -- you seem to have been particularly upset afterward toward the end . is this harder to swallow , just given your success here and how this tournament is seemingly up for grabs ?
katarina srebotnik has been around for many years . are you familiar with her play and the two of you have met in the past ?
this was the best you 've seen her play ?
two days ago you were talking in this interview saying how difficult it is to practice and to be inspired . so first of all do you think it 's a good idea to be , to talk so openly ?
well , how difficult it is to practice , you know , day after day .
still , you a few years ago , when you won this tournament , i 'll never forget that , you were in this room and you were all starry eyes and it was so beautiful to see , how you said , you just ...
no , it 's not . you were so up ?
what do you feel like you need to do to , you know , after the olympics and then here , i mean , to sort of get back to your level where ...
do you think this tournament will help eventually kind of solve the glut of top women who 's going to be no.1 ?
you caused quite a few problems there .
you did n't feel out of place , then ?
what 's the biggest thing you 'll take from this experience this week ?
so did you surprise yourself this week ?
has it been a really good week because of the fact you feel you 're making progress and you can actually see the progress ?
what will you do ? what 's your schedule the rest of the year ?
your ranking is going to go up after this obviously . will that make a difference to the sort of events you 're going to be able to play and the number of points you can pick up ?
that top 50 goal , is that for the season ?
did you go to that restaurant last night ?
did you get the seating plan that you wanted ?
do you go away from this now feeling totally comfortable in these surroundings against players like dementieva , where before you would have had a little bit of worry ?
you obviously played at wimbledon before , as well , but the experience here , has that given you a real taste for playing at this sort of level ?
what was it like today compared with playing on the outside courts ?
what are the differences between you and elena dementieva , in a nutshell ?
do you think that 's something you 'll acquire as you play these top players week in and week out ?
she was pretty complimentary about you after the match in interview . she said , i thought anne played really well today . she obviously thought that was your best shot . you did n't think it was your best shot , so i suppose that 's quite a positive , really ?
only 11 deuces . that 's not bad ?
what are you trying to do to your dear mother , for heaven 's sake ?
you can tell that you 're under some stress , too .
of course you want to win every point , but when you 're late in the second set like that , do you stop to think , what if we go to a third set , what would that be like ?
what did she do , if anything , that surprised you ?
are you feeling well-rested ? are you playing in better condition than the other night ?
you going to play mixed doubles ?
some players seem to like a little drama in their matches . are you one of those ?
but in a way you like it a little bit ?
subconsciously some people might like that .
what do you think about ana 's elimination ?
what about the effect on the draw ?
in your last two rounds you 've been on the court for i think just a few minutes under six hours . does that take a toll on you , that you 're out there too long ?
this is the second straight match where you kind of struggled to hold your serve . how concerned are you about that as you go forward in the draw ?
do you get tired of the media conferences after the matches ? sometimes when you 're playing a match , are you thinking about what you 're going to say afterwards ?
you do n't think of a good answer ?
how hard is it when you lose ?
there was one point you did the splits twice .
was that slightly a tougher match than you expected ?
she 's only just broken into the top 100 this year . how far do you think anne can go ?
maybe top 40 ?
after the upset of ivanovic yesterday , does that make you more determined , or you just say that 's the way tennis is ? what goes through your mind ?
i understand that .
so it 's now official that your next match is going to play na li from china . to my point of view , the winner between you and na will you have a better chance to go into your last four from your draw . do you think so , or do you think that this match can be very important as any other , you know , for you to go even further in this tournament ?
you said that if you played well this was winnable , but it seemed like you were having trouble with your groundstrokes . the first set and your serve , and the second ...
have you ever started a game with seven faults ?
how were you feeling when you finally got through all that and you still made it all the way to the breaker , when that 's starting ? how were you feeling and do you think the match is about to turn in your favor ?
did you allow yourself to think about when you left the court , any significance to that ?
so nothing has been crystallized in your mind about ...
what were you saying or thinking about during those rain delays and you came out very flat after the first one ?
after a couple matches under your belt , not playing singles for a while , did you feel like a favorite going into this ?
the last few games , it looked like you were muttering to yourself in between points . what were you saying ? she was taking a while , too , between serves .
did you feel a little as if you were reacting -- huge crowd support -- did you feel like , `` i 've got to do this for them as much as for myself '' ?
you won your first grand slam here almost 10 years ago . how long does it really feel for you ?
going on the court , do you have some of the same memories ?
are you quite pleased ? straight set victory again second round ? feel pretty good about the way you played ?
you 've talked a lot about how hard you worked the last few years . what do you think is better about yourself ? what do you feel is the most obvious thing that 's improved recently for you ?
you talked a little bit about that few days ago the team around you , about your coach in particular , and that you feel you 're on the same page . what has that relationship been like ?
how did you guys find each other , or you how did that work out ?
you talked the other day about marat , one of the things he worked with you when you were younger , was that you would cry and get very , very emotional . i think he said , as an example , do n't act like me . he talked about that , also in his press conference shortly thereafter . is that a bit of a family trait , to sort of wear your emotions on your sleeve ? and if so , is that something that you really work really hard on keeping in control , so that when things do n't go so well you can regroup ?
your summer really took off after roland garros . i mean , obviously you 're playing extremely well . what was the turning point this season for you ? do you think it 's learning to control your emotions ? is it something you 've learned in your coaching ? what happened midsummer when you really started playing so well ?
did marat have a lot to do with that ?
how long has he been your coach ?
and you made that decision on your own to change coaches ?
was it a question that you just had heard what your other coach had to say for so long and it was n't quite working so you needed to try something else ? had you known your present coach for a while or several years or just ...
in other words , your old coach , you had heard what he had to say for several years .
did you think that you had heard everything from him that you could hear , so you needed to have someone else tell you something different ?
would it be the same with your at this fitness coach ?
the fact that henin is not there anymore and there 's not one clear player , does it make a difference for you and the other players if there 's not one clear person who maybe seems to be above everyone else ?
julie said that she felt out there today that she felt you almost seemed nervous . some errors on the forehand , the double faults . she does n't know what 's in your head , but she said from her perspective it seemed that you were nervous . maybe playing with the no.1 ranking might have been a lot of pressure for you . is that a fair assessment of the way you felt today ?
since winning roland garros you had a tough wimbledon and a tough tournament here , both at no.1 . i just wonder , do you feel the pressure of no.1 , or does that make you play a little different ?
you mentioned the thumb . how badly did the thumb bother you today ?
i think you said the other day you went from beijing to australia for physio .
and then obviously playing in the states prior . i mean , that 's a lot of travel . how much do you think that that factored in , having all that travel ?
what about julie 's game surprised you the most ? like you said earlier , you did n't know what to expect .
how hard was that for you ? because , i mean , obviously you 're used to being able to execute shots . you 're out there , no.1 player in the world , and you ca n't do what you want to do .
which one has been your biggest opportunity you think you missed in the match ?
i know it 's not quite easy to ask because it 's just after the game , but do you have any specific plans to go back home and regroup and maybe get back to regain the no.1 position , because you may lose it ?
who do you think will win this tournament , and why ?
julie said that happened when she was out there she did n't feel nervous . it was just another game until it got to the match points . were you surprised with the poise that she showed out there ?
how do you see the chances for caroline wozniacki to win this tournament , or at least get into the final ?
i watched you play qualifying at the challenger in the bronx two weeks ago where you lost to an irish girl who was ranked 200th in the world . would you imagine that two weeks later you 'd be here on arthur ashe stadium beating the no.2 in the world ?
what do you think when you 're serving for the match . you double faulted once ; were you getting nervous ?
there was a couple of times where you tossed the ball in the air too and you stopped yourself . what was happening there ?
would you just describe how you got to clemson ? most european women just turn pro right away . how did you end up at the university ?
what has amlie meant to you as a professional tennis player ? talk about her influence and has she influenced you at all as a countrywoman in some ways ?
she said just now that she knows a little bit about your game . she said , am i shocked ? she said , no . she said , i am surprised but not shocked because there are things about your game that could pose dangers for any player .
having just beaten the no.1 player in the world you said before talking about that . but also , the fact that you 're going to be facing amlie in the next round , describe what 's going through your mind right now .
but i 'm not asking to you look ahead two matches , three matches . the next match , amlie , does that make it a little more special perhaps ?
you said on the court before that you were nervous about being at big court .
you were supposed to be on the other court ?
you 've mainly been playing the challenger tour . talk a little bit about what life is like on that court and what it would mean for you to move into the wta ?
what was it like for you after you won the first set and she found some momentum in the second . how do you feel like you responded ? but how did you respond to her winning the second set ?
when you were playing on the itf events maybe in places that you did n't find very nice , were you considered at any point stopping to play tennis ?
what are your parents ' names and what sport did they play ?
what sports ?
team handball ?
and they regretted ...
they pushed you hard to be professional ?
what was your plan if you were to quit ? you said at the end of this , maybe before this happened that you would stop . what would you have done ?
there was an especially bad match that made you have those thoughts ?
how difficult was it today to block out the crowd and the atmosphere and concentrate on your tennis ?
is this the first wta tournament you 've played ? is it the first slam , and you tried at wimbledon and you did you not qualify at roland garros and wimbledon , et cetera , and you qualified here ?
did you think it would take so long to get to anything , into a main draw ?
were there weaknesses in ana 's game today ? did you sense anything that she was struggling to do out there that you were going to be able to exploit ?
have you spoken to your parents yet ?
when you 're in vancouver earlier this month , you made the finals there and won the first set . did you feel more pressure against radwanska than you did today ?
can i ask a clemson question : american football is so big there . did you get into that whole thing ?
how do you feel about the way you played , and what do you think of her game ? she played a real tough first set .
you had a breakthrough here obviously with the championship . i mean , talk about what this place means to you , what this tournament means to you as a one-time champion .
are you happy with your game right now , the way you 're playing ?
what can you tell us about your younger opponent for today ?
how do you keep up your mental toughness in your training ?
many people have said the women 's side is so wide open this year . having success here , also having a tough times here , just your experiences , how much of an advantage do you think that is for you ?
i know that was a while ago , the first-round loss here . but can you go through what you did in the first set today ? does a little piece of that still linger in your head ?
world no.1 ranking on the women 's side has changed i think five times this year , four different women . justine obviously is not in the game . she 's retired . talk about the women 's field right now . is there more parity now than there has been , say , in the past several years ? world no.1 can go to almost anybody if you really fight hard .
that was impressive .
what do you put it down as ?
you did n't look at all nervous in the start , whereas you had a bit in the first match .
she showed a lot of character in the third set , which you have must be pleased about . you stayed patient .
on reflection , how important was the experience and the way you played against venus at wimbledon this year in terms of building your confidence levels up ?
at the end of wimbledon , with laura robson winning , there were a lot of people talking about her being the next hope . did that inspire you , fire you up at all , to maybe prove someone else is around , too ?
maybe you 're proving that it 's not just about the future , you 're doing well .
judging by the way things are going , looks like you might see the olympic champion in the next round ?
how do you feel about that ?
what do you think when she went off for that what looked like a change of clothes ? that not actually legal to do that , is it ?
do you think she was intending for it to affect you ? seems a bit strange before you 're serving .
were there times where you were worried that this year you 're enjoying now would n't come along , you would n't get that break ?
you said you felt it was a matter of time and confidence . but at the same time , have there been things in your game that have changed that you 've improved in the last year or two , do you think ?
i suppose because of the nature of the tournaments they tend to play in , british women tend to kind of fly under the radar in terms of publicity . they might get the results in every once in a while , but this is going to be big headlines , back page , maybe , who knows ? do you like that thought , that it 's actually going to be a surprise element and here you are on the back pages rather than just a line ...
most of what you 've done in your career has been as it were small print . this is going to be big print . is that nice ?
do you think in the past that british women have n't had the profile they deserve , or do you feel that that 's just been a reflection of results ?
are you having to pick up the tab every night for your family 's ...
have you got a particular favorite place you like to go out here in new york ?
how about for tonight ?
what is your dinner of choice before you play then ?
is that with nigel , then ?
what was the fish of the day ?
there came a time in the third set in which you were on the ground . you were down for about 30 seconds and there was no noise at all . were you injured at all , or were you just trying to just regain yourself ?
was the pavement hot ?
did you think about taking a nap ?
you remember ever doing that before in a match , being down for 30 seconds or so ?
why do you think you were so tired at that point ?
so you won just in time .
is there one aspect of your game that 's more difficult to get back after the injury ?
i just spoke to sofia arvidsson , and she felt you showed bad sportsmanship , especially you serve . she did with this with her hand and you still served . what is your comment on that ?
is it bad blood between you ? because she was a bit annoyed also when you lie down , you know , the ball we were talking about just before .
what do you make of this situation where five of you have a chance to be no.1 by winning this tournament ?
to follow up on that , that question , i mean , obviously you want to be no.1 , but do you think in your mind it 's better for tennis to have a dominant player who 's no.1 ?
aside from injuries , is there any other reason that you think it just kind of keeps being passed from one player to another ?
can you go for a second week ?
if you look at your draw , though , this is probably your best chance ever to reach a grand slam final if you play to your level . are you saying that you can not get to the level to reach a grand slam final here ?
having a good time otherwise ?
dancing ?
you said you cramped on the treadmill after the match ; is that correct ?
is that normal for you after a lengthy match ?
is it customary for you to go on a treadmill after a lengthy match ?
and you cramped where ? it was behind the meniscus ?
how long would you have run if you did n't have the problem ?
i want to tell you that you have a huge number of fans in china , and they really love you , you know , especially you 're winning the special gold medal in beijing olympic games . but the question is , you could meet na li in the fourth round if you both win the next match . that could be a huge , tough battle for both of you . how do you think of her as a player ?
after winning the single match in beijing olympics , do you think you are now into another level to be a great player ? and also , russia , how do they react for your winning as the gold medallist in the olympic games ? that 's the first time for women tennis to win a gold medal , you know .
you said the other day you watched the closing ceremonies on sunday night , and you felt in a way that your mind and your heart were still in beijing . that that was a challenge , that you have to turn your focus now and focus on the grand slam and that you clearly have come out with two , especially today , two very strong outings . i mean , do you feel right now that beijing 's fully behind you and you 're locked and focused on this event ?
do you feel great about the way you played today ?
what do you know about your next opponent ?
how do you feel about the way you 're serving now ? i notice that occasionally you 'll have a game where you 'll throw in maybe two double faults , but you seem to have an amazing ability to bounce back mentally from that .
as a high-profile member of the wta , i was just curious what you thought about what ashley harkleroad did to pose in playboy . is that something good for sport , entertainment ? has there been any talk or discussion between the wta members ?
back to your serve , if you do struggle on your serve , what do you focus on to get yourself back mentally into it and not to let it affect you ?
talking about the wta , people would say there 's a time and place for everything . serena said it was not time for the serbians . do you think that it 's time for a russian or an american again or , like , it 's a battle for everyone to compete for no.1 ?
you had a couple of breaks in both sets . was it you or was it she ?
at one time in your life third round was sort of a formality . first time of a slam this year , is it pretty great ?
you made reference outside to you need to work on your game . how valuable is that for you relative to your season this year as opposed to someone who has n't been playing a regular schedule ?
did you go home to california before ...
what about bartoli ?
what 's the specific memory you think about when you think back to '98 , being ten years now ?
you have to remember that dropshot ?
obviously this is a new balance for you , and having a son , too . how long do you think you will continue it or ...
at wimbledon your mom spoke about -- she was there , she spoke about looking around more and noticing things more because she had n't expected to have that time and here it was , it might not come again . do you do that now more than ...
is johnny still here ?
you said in your tennis magazine article , i think it was maybe a year ago , you were saying that people remember other players maybe before they 'd remember you . you obviously have , though , a lot of fans . who do you think your fans are ? why would they gravitate towards ...
along the same lines , do you feel like you sort of represent mothers now ?
even while you 're focused out there , at any moment are you amazed to still be out there ?
very nice start to your us open campaign . feel good today ?
you come in with great , great momentum ; hardcourt season very successful for you . just talk about arguably one of the hottest player coming in right now , at least in the assessment of many . just talk about your sense of confidence and coming forward and what your goals and ambitions are here .
marat , having won here before , how special would it be for you to equal his accomplishment in the same venue ?
what did you and marat fight about when you were little kids ?
i actually meant at home . i did n't mean on the tennis court .
yeah .
would you ever tell him that he is n't the most adult person always on the court , either ?
which sort of relationship do you have with your brother ? now you are one of the first players in the world . you are playing so well . you are champion . you , too . which has changed between you ?
what would you like to have about marat , like tennis player or like human being ?
like human being , what do you think is his best quality ?
human being .
where were you when he won here ?
and were you at home or ...
and how long was it before you were able to reach marat after he won ?
now that you have more success than him , is there advice you can give to him ? and would he listen to your advice ?
i was at a press conference of his last week in los angeles , and he said it used to be that i was her big brother . now it 's the opposite . now it changed . do you see it that way ?
now you 're the one that 's known more ?
are you going to watch his match ? he 's about to play .
we know something about the marat girlfriends . we do n't know anything about the safina boyfriend . what you can say about that ?
have you guys ever had a sibling rivalry , or is it even more noticeable now that maybe you 're having more success than he is ? has there ever been envy or jealousy between you ?
what do your parents say to you about that ? in order to not have that sibling rivalry , what have they said to you ?
are you glad he 's a brother and not a sister so you do n't have to play him ?
it just came to my attention that we over here might be mispronouncing your name as -- would you like us to correct us ?
do you think you lost at the olympics because you were tired ? that was the reason ?
she said yesterday that it 's been very difficult for her to focus right now on this tournament , that sunday night she watched the closing ceremonies . she said in a lot of ways her heart still felt like she was in beijing . this has been a very difficult transition for her . have you had any of that similar-type experience ?
what do you attribute that to , though ? you 're just feeling very comfortable right now ?
compared to last year , have you lost weight ?
i do n't know . i ask .
you do n't know ?
you 're both playing your opening matches today . is this a significant day for the family ?
must have been very frustrating , because sometimes you had your game ; sometimes you did n't .
this monday , yesterday or ...
was your participation here ever in doubt ? did you worry that you would not be able to play here at all ?
so you went from beijing to australia to new york ?
your doctor in australia , what was he able to do for you or give you that 's made it better ?
pretty thrilling match for a first round for a no.1 player with match points and everything . were you a little nervous at the end ?
when you 're hitting the ball , are you doing it without worrying about the pain ? can you do it naturally now ?
what has been the hardest part for you : the actual physical pain or just the frustration of knowing you have n't really been able to build on the momentum you gained from your french open win ?
do you have enough experience now to be able to play your way into a grand slam ?
there are obvious advantages to having a quick and easy first-round match , but you can look at having a very difficult one such as you had today and the way you were challenged in a positive way , too ? i would think insomuch you are able to fight through and maybe get some momentum and have a match like that behind you ; do you feel that way ?
do you think your frequent flier mileage helped attribute to your near scare today ?
considering the lack of practice time and everything you 've been through , what are your realistic expectations here ? you 're the no.1 seed , but do you feel you can actually get really far here ?
were you pleased by the way you went to the net when you needed to ?
your fitness training has been very important for you the last couple of years . were you able to keep that up even thought you did n't play , or did you even do more because you were bored ?
can you describe the experience of coming into new york competing in this event as the no.1 seed ?
have you paid attention to the circuit since wimbledon ? and if you have , who is the player who 's impressed you the most ?
are you still living in brooklyn ?
so where did you go to high school then ?
ojai , is that like the palm springs area ?
how do you assess your match ?
what 's it like to go a few weeks ago from the back courts of the brooklyn tennis club to now the billie jean king tennis center ?
obviously you are a tennis professional . do you see yourself going to college , playing ...
once you are a professional , even at 17 , are you still eligible to play ?
college ?
are you seeing yourself in college , tennis aside ?
is it a matter of being a team format when you talk about college versus singles ?
when you say you do n't see yourself as a college player ...
brooklyn has n't exactly been a hot bed of top tour stars . how did you emerge out of brooklyn ? can you tell us a little bit about your early background ?
what part ?
what was it like to switch , like the dodgers themselves in brooklyn to california and go out and play in pretty sunny california ?
how many years did you spend with mark ?
how did you meet him ?
how long have you been living in california ?
how often are you out there ?
brooklyn is more of a place for , let 's say , hoops or football or whatever . what was it like being a tennis player early on with your friends and so forth ?
it was a little different to go to the academy where people were playing ...
did you play kingsburg community college in manhattan beach ? is that where you played ?
public courts in manhattan beach ?
as they say `` the '' these days , what are your aspirational goals ? do you have some thoughts about top 100 , top 50 ? higher , lower ? what are your goals ?
there was a time when the new york area actually produced both male and female tennis players of note here , from mary carillo , vitas gerulaitis to the mcenroes . do you think you might be able to start a renaissance here , or is it just a one-shot ...
have you played the maccabi games in israel ?
the first tournaments you played as a junior were what ? what were the first tournaments you played ?
yeah .
where was it ?
in brooklyn ?
what do you like about your game ?
what would you like to improve ?
in mark weil academy , what is the best quality there ? i mean , let 's say that you have a young tennis player who wants to go to america . why would you suggest to go to mark weil academy ?
talk about your fighting spirit . do you think that 's a real strength of yours ? could you reflect on that for a moment ?
tell us a little bit about your parents , who introduced you to the game . what 's their background ?
do you have any mentors out on the wta tour ? people who you 're close to ?
when did you start playing ? how old were you ?
how did it happen ?
they were hitting what , tennis balls ?
and ?
and was it fun ?
are you familiar with the story of how seles started by hitting against the wall ?
can you tell me a little bit about your high school education and your relationship with high school ? were you home schooled or ...
do you wish you ever went to high school ? do you miss that experience ?
we have seen many players coached by their fathers , and some of them went through some kind of trouble , some others did n't . how is your relationship , if , let 's say one night you want to go out ? you have to ask your father and he 's also your coach . how does it work ?
do you have a deadline , you have to be back before midnight ?
every morning ?
okay .
did you identify with some of the very young teenage olympians who put so much , almost their entire life , into a single athletic endeavor with all that discipline and lack of contact with other elements ?
what do you take out of this match from here ?
yeah . what is your lesson ?
at the academy , do you always play against men or girls , or who do you practice mostly with ?
some said california is a little bit of heaven . what do you like best about life in california ?
what do you miss about brooklyn when you 're on the road ?
do you have brothers or sisters ?
do you ever play any other sport ?
does your dad still do his work ?
seems like sometimes you get quite angry at yourself on the court . have you ever found that that 's something that you need to control more or you need to work on ?
this is your biggest press conference , probably , in your life ?
what is your reaction to it ? are you surprised about the questions you 're being asked ? are you happy to be here or whatever ?
very well .
there are a lot of dogs in southern california . you could just move the family business there .
what kind of music is on your ipod ?
you said you have bean coming to the open since you were a little kid . any matches you watched as a kid that stood out in your mind that inspired you to become a pro ?
how did you feel out there today ? i 'm just wondering if you felt a little sluggish .
when did you arrive from beijing ?
so what type of reception did you get at home from your family and friends ?
with your countrymen out , rotator cuff injuries , the olympics , but winning the us open , would that be important from an american business perspective to get the endorsements from certain watch companies and other major corporations that other tennis players have been getting up to this point ?
once you are able to refocus , how do you think that experience will help you in big events like grand slams ?
do you feel like more of a winner ?
how important was that for you mentally with the pressure you put on yourself ? you 're saying all year beijing is it for me . this is the important thing . then to actually go into the final and win the match .
serena williams said on saturday that when she was a little girl growing up that she had so many dreams of winning wimbledon , winning the french open , winning the australian open , the us open , winning a lot of tournaments , grand slams . she said she never really dreamed of being an olympic champion . that was n't part of the plan . obviously she won gold in doubles . she said it was kind of a special feeling , one that she had n't really thought of as a little girl . when you were growing up , i mean , i 'm sure you dreamed of grand slam titles , but did you ever dream also ? was olympic gold always something that you dreamed of ?
have things changed in russia with so many wonderful russian tennis players ? you know , there has been such great results in the last five , six years . have things changed since you were a very young girl growing up in terms of regarding grand slam tournaments ?
is there a fatigue factor ? this has to be a letdown after the olympics . is there mental and physical letdown ?
you have a chance to be no.1 at the end of this tournament , and there are several players in the same position . why does n't anyone want to keep no.1 in women 's tennis ?
what 's your explanation for how open it is ?
prior to winning the olympics , you were perhaps a player that could go deep in a tournament , semifinals and finals , but had n't won that big tournament yet . now that you won the olympics , do you feel weight has been lifted from your shoulders , maybe you can play with a little less pressure on the court ?
what makes a tournament important ? is it the money ? is it the crowd ? is it the dream of the players ? what is the most important ?
what have you done with the gold medal ? are you sleeping with it ?
how did you play ?
what did you injure ?
what 's gone on in the interim that allowed you to play ?
which knee , lindsay ?
between sharapova being out and the olympics having taken place , do you think this is a good year for a lot of unheralded players to make a move ?
there 's no olympic hangover ? these players know what 's coming , they 're used to the travel ?
by pulling out of the singles at the olympics , was it more calculated with the thought of saving your knee for the doubles , or was it that it was in that much pain ?
two years ago you sat in that chair and you fielded a lot of questions about how much longer you were going to play and how much longer your body ...
absolutely not . i 'm going to ask you if it feels like deja vu a bit ? do you feel like you 're kind of back to where you were at that point ?
you were a 14-year-old girl here ; you are a 32-year-old woman , a mother right now . your life has obviously changed considerably , as it should from 14 to 32. if you can look back at the span of the years and think about what this tournament has meant to you in those years and the maturity and your thoughts .
are your motivations and goals the same , or is there some kind of different perspective or knowing where you are as a player now ?
is that one of the biggest differences from when you were the best player in the world ?
can you talk about how your daily practice schedule and everything has changed from being a mother from the way it was before ?
since the olympics was your original motivation for coming back , was it crushing from having to withdraw from the singles ? did it feel incomplete ?
can you talk a little bit about the olympic experience other than on court ?
did you talk to dara torres at all ?
were you subjected at all to the volleyball players and coaches who had to go through that terrible personal tragedy ?
you said you have n't made any plans to play beyond the us open . when you sit down after this tournament with your family and make that decision , what are the main factors to go into that ?
it 's always a bit of a scramble , and no.1 is up in the air . but right now do you think we 're in a period of an extended scramble for no.1 ? justine was ...
does it hurt the sport ? does it cause confusion for the fans ?
this year at torrey pines , tiger woods was able to share a championship with his daughter samantha , and he spoke about that .
sam , sorry . i guess i made an assumption . anyway , my point being , though , do you ever think about , as a mother , how wonderful it would be to -- is that a dream and a motivation of yours ?
but what would it mean for you to be sitting in the stands while he plays the final of the us open ?
when you look around the locker room you must feel like the senior citizen .
we know that you do n't like to lose . is it any easier to lose to your sister or is it just the same ?
is it harder in any way ?
but you 're happy for her , are n't you ?
what 's going through your mind when she 's celebrating ? did you sense any sort of difference in her celebration because she knows it 's you that she just defeated ?
you were up in the first set and then something happened . did you get tight ? did you lose some rhythm ?
did you feel tight at all ?
can you find any satisfaction that it seemed to be a very well-played match , balls going everywhere , both chasing down shots , or does the result sort of leave you a little numb ?
did she make you not play well with her shots , or was it you disappointed in the way you played ?
so you just played this match with her . you lost ; she won . now you have to somehow , a couple hours later , put that behind you and be on the same side of the court with her to play doubles . what do you think that 's going to be like ? how are you preparing yourself for that ?
what does this win say about her as a grass court player ?
did you look up at your family at any point during the match ? if so , is what you see in their faces any different than when you 're not facing a sister ?
from yourself ?
venus was serving serves into your body . is there anybody out there who serves into the body as well as venus williams ?
what are your expectations as far as the two of you meeting again in finals of majors ? how much do you think this is a likelihood in the future ?
do you at any time forget you 're playing venus ?
how would you rate your game today on a scale of 1 to 10 ?
third game of the second set , worked really hard , a lot of breakpoints . you finally break her to go up 2-1. the next game you lose your serve . what do you think happened there , and how important was that ?
were you tired at all or ...
part of a lot of your big matches is a kind of free-form expression , fist pumping , talking to yourself . did you feel like you were drawing back a little bit today since you were playing venus , there was a limitation there ?
a few years ago when you and venus were meeting pretty regularly in finals . did it feel different five years later in terms of the two of you sort of being more on your own , whereas before it was happening regularly , it felt like it was all in the family , and this time it felt more like , as venus said the other day , every williams for themselves ?
what message do you think the two of you have sent about the two of you as competitors and as sisters with the way you 've shared details of your closeness ?
about your closeness as sisters and how it becomes a competition when you 're on the court .
if anyone else had caught as many or aborted as many service tosses as venus did today , would you have been irritated enough to talk to the chair umpire about it ?
what exactly happened on that let call , from your perspective ?
did the ball land in or out ? do you know ?
when you came over to the side of the court , did you have a discussion with him ?
since the match ended have you been kind of alone to deal with it , or have you been hanging out with venus after the match ?
have you talked at all ?
you do n't look happy at all .
considering serena is almost untouchable on grass , you played a good game , a good second set . this year you have reached your personal standard , and the asian one as well . what will you remember most about 2008 wimbledon ?
was there a point at times in the second set when you felt there was a possibility you could turn the match and win ?
you hit a lot more winners and forcing shots with your backhand than your forehand . are you aware that your backhand is a much stronger shot ?
we 've been reading about the incredible number of people watching you on tv back home . we heard 100 million for the last round . how do you deal with knowing that so many people are watching you and hoping you 're gon na win ?
when you now go back to china for the olympics , do you expect to be treated like a hero ?
have any dignitaries from china called you to congratulate you , anyone important in the government ?
who is that ?
for somebody not so tall , you stand in really quite close and take a very early ball . is this spontaneous or is it something you have been coached into doing tactically ?
who is your most frequent practice partner ? here at wimbledon , who have you been practicing with the most ?
does that lead to tensions on the court sometimes between you , playing against him as well ?
who wins ?
we have seen a lot of attention on the glamorous lifestyle that ana and maria and some of the other girls have adopted . some of that is going to come your way if you want it to . how do you feel about that ?
what are your thoughts on the final ?
that first set , what were you thinking when you came out and venus was playing like that ?
you had never played her before on grass . how would you describe her as a grass court player ?
and what did you say to yourself after that first set to get yourself pumped up for the second ?
what about your own game on grass ? when you come back next year , what do you think you have to improve on to take that extra step ?
do you think the williams sisters have struck the right formula in that they do n't play every tournament , they just peak for the grand slams ? have they found a better formula for playing tennis in the long-term ?
if it is an all-williams final , how do you see it ?
why ca n't you imagine it , and what do you think it says about them that they have been able to manage it ?
what do you think it says about their relationship , their closeness , that even though they 've played against each other on the grand stages so many times and they are still are so close ?
when you say it 's a family decision , do you mean they 're going to sit down and decide who the winner 's going to be ?
why do n't they just go out like two other players and let the best player win ?
will you be watching the final if it is venus versus serena , and what do you think will be going through your mind ? what will you be looking for as you watch it ?
why ?
do you think that perhaps unlike two other opponents , they 're less willing to battle against each other and be aggressive ?
it makes it a bit boring for tennis , do you think ?
the last time they played just this year it went deep into the third set , a close tiebreak . that would indicate a pretty interesting match .
last year andy roddick was talking about how many grand slams he would have won if federer was not around . we know you have a problem with your serve . how many slams do you think you would have won if you had a really strong serve ?
was the fact that you had played a couple of three-set matches , compared to venus who had had straight sets all the way to the semifinal , do you think that was a factor in this match ?
you were hitting that forehand rather hard . is it more of a question of she winning than you losing ?
what was it that was working for you in the second set that enabled you to win but that you could n't keep going in the third ?
do you feel you competed well in that match ?
did you approach it any differently than your other matches against venus ?
even though she did serve big , you still created many breakpoint chances . could you speak about venus ' ability when she faced a breakpoint to then do something even bigger ? it seemed like she became a different player at that point .
you seemed to enjoy yourself out there .
in recent years in your homeland there have been some tough times , burma , thailand , india . what does it mean that two of you from that area have reached the quarters ?
when you had to qualify here two years ago you were ranked 164. now you 're going to be ranked 37. how does that feel ?
can you tell us how much coverage there would be of this match in thailand , newspapers and television ?
now that you 've lost will you leave wimbledon or stay here for the rest of the tournament ?
are you pretty much the only international woman athlete out of thailand , or are there others in other sports ?
is it still with you that you were one of the first two players onto ashe stadium ? is that something you have pride in and reflect on ?
have you made a plan yet for what you will do after you retire from tennis ? are you studying in addition , or do you plan to teach ?
right now as you 're playing tennis ?
her serve seemed to give you some trouble . what was tough about her serve today ?
how much of an advantage is that for her against a lot of players , particularly on this surface ?
what happened with your foot-fault in the first set ? it seemed to upset you a little bit .
what did you actually get called for , serving in the wrong quadrant ?
how long would you say that affected you for ?
do you think you missed an opportunity when you pulled it back ?
by the end of the second set the momentum seemed to be very much with you . what happened at the start of the third set to change that ?
how do you rate the level of elena 's play compared to a few years ago ?
did you draw the umpire 's attention to the problems you were having with the heat ?
even though you 're disappointed now , what will you take away from this grass court season ?
presumably when you come to wimbledon you do n't expect the heat to be a problem .
how does it feel to be in the wimbledon semifinals ?
was what happened at the french open against safina going through your mind ?
what did you tell yourself coming off the chair going into the third set ?
and when you served the match out this time at 5-3 , it looked like you had no nerves whatsoever and actually played well .
you say you have a problem with your concentration . what can you do to improve that ?
can you talk about your early years on grass and how difficult it was for you .
can you afford any sort of loss of concentration in the semifinal , given who you 're up against ? you got away with having some loss of concentration today . do you think you 'll be able to get away with it in the semifinal ?
last week you were coached by john van lottum who is now back in holland . what could he do to help you , and did you miss him the last two matches ?
in your mind , when you were serving for the match , were you too confident ? did you think you were already in the semifinals ?
i was talking about the second set when you were serving for the match .
you say you 're the underdog against venus . as the top seed left in the competition , is this not yours for the taking ?
you have a few early thoughts on how you can beat her ?
nadia complained about the heat on court . said possibly the officials could have done a little bit more . we saw you holding an ice pack to the back of your neck . was there anything more the officials could have done ?
had you not put any sunblock on yourself ?
some players almost need to have dramatic shifts , ups and downs , almost like their emotions are triggered by that . are you one of those players ?
speaking of up and down , this is your 10th year on tour now . how do you manage to just maintain belief in yourself with all the ups , severe downs all the time ?
on tv you said when you were getting into trouble in the second set you thought about the french open . what was that like ?
you seem to have a very good attitude about this . some other players would be very defensive , basically lying through their teeth . you seem to be okay with it .
do n't you want a coach for a longer period ?
you worked with john .
how does it feel to be in your first quarterfinal of a grand slam ?
is this the best performance you 've ever had at a grand slam in an individual match ? have you ever played better than this ?
today , was this the best you played ?
what is it about wimbledon this year that has brought the best out of you ? do you feel at home here on grass ?
if you win the next match , you become the first chinese player to reach a semifinal in a grand slam . does that drive you on or excite you ?
i think it 's nicole vaidisova .
is there a lot of pressure back in china ? the newspapers today were all saying next is the olympics and a gold medal is all you 're missing . is that getting a bit ahead of themselves ?
tanasugarn is in the quarterfinals as well . what does it mean for you to have two asian players in the quarterfinals here ?
how does it feel to finally be in a quarterfinal ?
were you aware that jelena was struggling with an injury out there ?
must 've given you incentive that you could finish her off .
were you aware before the match that she was not a hundred percent ?
did that give you more encouragement today ?
you seemed to have a back injury . what happened and how is it now ?
you seemed very emotional at the end . were there a few tears ?
you spoke yesterday about your superstition . you 've been the same shower . is that something you did today ?
you will do before the game against venus , i take it ?
you 've been toiling away at this for a long time . when the season began , did you have sort of a plan for yourself of , well , i 'm going to play this season and see how it goes ? did you have a feeling that maybe the end was approaching at all ?
paradorn got a lot of attention a couple years ago when he had to go and essentially become a monk for a week i guess it is . is there any similar ritual that women from thailand go through when they 're a certain age ?
there 's no equivalent thing for a women , like going into a convent or anything like that ?
when was this ?
you have a very long first name and surname .
have you ever had a nickname , a shorter name ?
when you were struggling , 130 , 140 in the world and you had to go back and play the satellite tournaments , what kept you going ? you were 27 or 28. most players would think it 's the end .
what are your thoughts on playing venus williams ?
as someone who has been on the tour for quite a long time and been at wimbledon for so many years in a row , what sense of appreciation do you have at this sometimes seemingly inevitable march to a williams sisters final , and what are your thoughts on when they play each other ?
as you look around the locker room and see these tall trees around , six-foot teenagers , powerful , did you ever think like the game might have passed you by ? why do you think you might have been able to remain competitive ?
both you and jie zheng from china , you beat the world no.1 and no . 2. do you think it has similarities for the asian girls beating world no.1 and no.2 ?
i wonder which culture you feel you identify with more ? do you feel equally split between thailand and america , or if you identify more with one than the other ?
so what were you thinking late into the third set ? she gets up on you 4-1 and you start your comeback again .
she started playing very aggressive to get to 4-1 and felt like she stopped a little bit playing aggressive , and you seemed to gain control of it again .
what are your thoughts on how your game is suited for grass court play ?
what do you like about it ?
what are your thoughts now about playing serena williams , and what it will take for you to do well against her ?
what 's the biggest challenge about her game for you ?
do you still feel like a young player who is happy to be in the quarterfinals , or do you feel like now you 've been on the tour for a couple years , a former junior champion , and you actually belong at this level with the great players ?
do you like to play against serena when she 's the favorite and maybe people do n't think you have too much chance ? are you happier than when people think you 're the one who is going to win ?
i do n't know who your coach is , but does your sister help you at all with advice ?
can you talk about your relationship with your father and how you separate the father/daughter from the coach and the student .
when you 're done with matches , when do you stop talking about tennis with your father and just talk about other things ?
is he easy on you or sometimes he 's easy and sometimes not so easy ?
how surprised were you to win at eastbourne ?
do you remember the first time you saw serena play ? can you talk about your memories of that ?
just your images of what you saw of her as a player .
what are the biggest strengths of your game that might give serena the most trouble ?
are you optimistic ?
how did you like your chances today before the match ?
what happened in the third set when you were leading 1-4 ?
did she deserve to win ?
what do you think her chances are against serena williams , and what do you think it will depend on ?
what are her chances do you think of beating serena ?
what are your thoughts on the top four seeds here being out at this point , what it might suggest as far as the big picture on the women 's tour ?
you said radwanska 's game is well-suited for grass .
can you elaborate ? what specifically makes her good on grass ?
williams sisters are born for grass ?
how much was the knee responsible for you losing today ?
did you ever at any stage consider not playing today ?
what was the diagnosis of the injury ?
what are your emotions right now ?
are you concerned about the wear and tear on players on the tour ? it seems there are so many injuries all the time right now . if you have any thoughts about what might be done about it that you 'd like to share .
what should the tour and other tennis governing bodies do to address the injury situation , do you think ?
what did the doctors tell you that you 're going to need to do to get your knee healthy ?
did they tell you you 're going to need to be reevaluated after your play here ?
what were the injections ?
venus raised that point before , being a champion being on court 2. what do you think about that ?
did they explain to you why you were on court 18 ?
is it a man/woman , gender thing ?
will you speak with them again about it ?
there was a lot of slugging it out from the baseline today . did you have any particular tactics you were working on ?
were you finding it a difficult match with the grass ? how is the grass playing at the moment ?
a lot of players will say after big losses they put it right behind them and do n't think about it . that 's easier said than done . after paris you seemed to have just forgotten about that and just moved ahead . can you talk about the mental process of forgetting losses , getting yourself back together again .
does surface matter to you any more , or do you think grass , clay , hard court , if you play your game you 'll be pretty much okay ?
beating someone like shahar , you said you watched her match against safina . she was a little bit tired . she 's also a player that can be mentally tough because she keeps running . you did n't seem to ever lose your focus or doubt what you were doing .
talk about your serve . have you been working on it ? do you think it 's improved ?
after you won you had this wonderful smile . is that moment here at wimbledon worth all the tough losses , the injuries ?
both you and nadia have been through a lot , and you both have big goals left in your career . you 'll be playing her next round . how much does this mean to you ? how much would a victory mean to you ?
will the winner be the one who plays technically better or the mentally tough player at the end ?
seems every year or two there 's a whole new wave of young russian players which is sometimes to pronounce their names .
does it sometimes get a little confusing for you with all the new players ?
the pronunciation has to be easy for a russian .
you had difficulty in the second set returning serve from the deuce court . why ?
were you a little too concerned about returning and having your backhand side opened up for her ?
it 's not unusual to see a young player handling another opponent 's injury . was that a factor today ?
what tournaments in the u.s. will we see you at ?
satisfied with that ?
the service ace to finish it off . did you look up at the board to see how fast it was ?
127 .
which i think might equal your best . how important is that power to your game ?
do you and serena have contests to see who 's fastest ?
big chances for both of you now in this tournament .
you ran through the first five games in 17 minutes . then did she just pick up her pace ? all of a sudden you get broken and are trailing . what happens there ?
you 've been such a clear spokesperson for equal pay and also for gender equality . the commentator justin gimelstob has made some very controversial comments about kournikova , vaidisova , women in general . what are your thoughts about those ?
you and serena reached four majors in a row . a lot of big players have struggled here . is it getting harder to have that kind of consistency in women 's tennis ?
you and serena were in four majors in a row .
correct .
yes .
do you think the tour is deeper than it was five or ten years ago ?
it 's not been the best of weeks for american men . do you feel the pressure on your shoulders to try to deliver in the women 's ?
do you know what 's going wrong ?
do you think if you did know what was going on you would be paid a lot ?
you were talking about staying healthy , which of course is the main object of every athlete . when you go out to practice , are you worried that all of a sudden it may show up again , or are you in good enough shape with physical therapy , et cetera , where you feel confident it wo n't happen ?
you obviously enjoy doubles a lot . but when you 're playing singles , what is the dynamic and what is the appreciation of that one-to-one competition , and what do you enjoy most about it ?
and how about the competitive aspect ? what do you appreciate most about being in competition against just one other person ? what do you thrive with most in that aspect of it ?
tennis players have to deal with three major hassles in a way : there 's those devastating losses that come , incredible travel , and then injuries . can you compare them in any way as obstacles in your career ?
travel and tough losses .
in terms of the travel , do you sometimes wake up and have no idea where you are ?
you 've looked fabulous all week in your eleven dresses . is it exciting wearing your own creations at the world 's biggest tournament ?
do n't you think that women tennis players should go back on tennis and less fashion , because that may be the reason why so many failed this year , sharapova among others ?
has eleven been going well in the states ?
given the difficulty of the sort of traveling that you do , could you tell us again why the olympics means so much to you that you would make such a difficult trip and one so close to the us open ?
can we ask about the knee .
why did you take the tape off ?
how is it feeling now ?
at this stage , is there any danger that you might not be able to participate in the fourth round ?
you are n't going dancing this weekend ?
is this match a classic example of a veteran player knowing how to beat --
is it a classic case of a veteran player --
an experienced player , how is that ?
17 .
she 's not a veteran .
a lot of the big names have lost in the tournament , a lot of upsets .
but you 've only gotten to the fourth round here at wimbledon . maybe this surface does n't play into your defensive skills that way . no one really is playing that great . do you feel like this is a tournament you can win ?
when you get out on the court , outside of what grass is supposed to be , do you really feel like it 's playing radically different than a fast hard court ?
does the ball bounce a lot differently than a fast hard court ?
consistency is rewarded in the rankings . you have a legitimate shot at no.1 if you do well here . is that in the back of your mind here ?
have you thought about your next-round opponent ?
thai girl .
tanasugarn .
do you like grass any more this year than previous years ?
are you surprised that ana ivanovic and sharapova have gone out of the competition ?
what was the last tournament you actually did not call a trainer in one match ?
do you remember the last time you did n't call a trainer ? you did n't call it against ana ivanovic .
what are your feelings after that win ?
you are the very first person from asia to put out a world no.1 at a grand slam event . how does it make you feel , and how confident are you for the next round ?
you will play the hungarian lady .
did you go out there hoping to win , or did you have a particular plan that you thought might be able to beat her ?
tennis is rapidly growing in your country . how excited will they be back in china about this result ?
are you playing on the olympic team ?
you already made the team before this tournament ?
how well-prepared is the chinese team for the beijing olympics ?
were you surprised that she did not play better than she did ?
on the return ?
were you aware that ana had come within one point of losing two days ago ?
did that cross your mind at all today as the match went on and you closed in on the victory ?
did you have the belief , before you got on court , that you could play your best tennis now ?
ana told us that it was difficult for her to play you because the balls were so low , that that was especially difficult for her . was that a strategy or a tactic you had specifically for ana , or is this the way you prefer to play the ball always ?
as well as you play on grass , why not think , if i play this well maybe i could go further in the tournament ?
win more matches in the tournament .
on television you thanked your husband . is he your coach as well ?
will you play both singles and doubles in the olympics ?
so now that you 've played so well on grass , maybe they should play the olympics on grass .
how significant is it for you and for the chinese to do well in beijing ?
how important is it for you and the chinese to do well there ?
when you won there was a little smile , but sometimes when we see the girls win they 're screaming and jumping . you were a little more shy . is that normal for you ?
when the world comes to beijing for the olympics , what is the one thing you would most like the world to learn about your country ?
bethanie mattek , who is your next opponent , she 's into fashion , too , in a way . i was wondering , when she was wearing all those , let 's say unusual costumes on court , whether you thought to yourself , this is my kind of person ?
what do you think of her as a player ?
how about what you just said about americans . the american men did n't do well . you know , about having an all-american match .
do you ever get surprised when other top players go down , like sharapova and ivanovic ?
the whole thing of great players coming into tournaments and losing early , and it 's happened to you , to venus , to them . your thoughts on why it can happen .
you had a string of slams in a row . now it seems like it 's tougher to pull that kind of string off . what else do you think might account for that in the women 's game ?
in pro tennis there are not only injuries but the tough schedule and tough losses that you have to face . of those three things , what do you think is the toughest ?
the great wall of china .
what were your thoughts about the taj mahal ?
we 're on course for an all-williams-sisters final . would you look forward to playing big sis in another williams final ?
when you 've won your slams , you 've probably peaked at different points in the slam . is there generally a point during the slam when you begin to hit your peak for that final run to the championship ?
are you there yet ?
since you won the australian 2007 you have n't gone beyond the quarterfinals at any of the slams . you 've had some injuries . do you put a lot of pressure on yourself now that you have to get past that ? are you really thinking about that ?
do you remember what it was like when you won your first major as a young player and then went to the next major , what that felt like ?
did you feel extra pressure or extra excitement that you were going to win ?
justin gimelstob , your teammate at the kastles , had a few comments this week for some of the female players on the tour . what did you make of those ?
he called anna kournikova a bitch and said miss vaidisova was very well-developed . he called another female player a sex pot .
vaidisova . is that the kind of thing you want to hear coming from another professional ?
is it the kind of thing that makes you think twice about playing beside him in washington ?
but is it ?
when you 're playing with your sister in doubles it is n't all business . you might have a conversation about where you 're going to eat or whatever . can you recall maybe the most unusual conversation you 've had with venus in the middle of a doubles match ?
between points ?
do you stay together or have separate lives when you 're at the tournament here ?
you mentioned that jehovah 's witnesses do n't vote . presuming you win the upcoming us open tournament and on that saturday night there 's someone to present you with the trophy , would you rather have it be senator mccain or senator obama ?
how would you sum up serena williams ' ideal man ? what kind of qualities would he have to have ?
the match today , two ex champions . do you have any thoughts of mauresmo ? how would you assess the entire match ?
it was mentioned earlier the guys have n't performed too well here . what is your spin on that ?
how did you see the match today ?
the rain did n't affect your concentration ?
justin gimelstob , in some comments a couple days ago , described you as a very well-developed young lady . he was n't talking about your backhand . do you have any sort of comment on what he said ?
you do n't find it disrespectful at all ?
did you do anything special during the rain break ?
rain breaks do n't disturb you or make you nervous ?
you had a fairly bad run during the clay court season . do you feel like your form 's coming back now ?
how do you feel different , compared to when you were n't playing as well ?
how do you know it 's coming back ? are there particular shots ?
with so many sports going on , of course there 's the euro tournament , soccer at the moment . but tennis has one aspect where it 's player against player . what goes through your mind about that direct competition ?
why ? what appeals to you about that direct competition and what goes through your mind as you 're across from an opponent ?
do you feel like you 're slightly off the radar ? three or four years ago you made a big breakthrough , everybody was talking about you . now you come here this year , maybe not so high profile . does that help you ?
what was your reaction to sharapova 's match yesterday ?
the mental side of playing against one opponent , what do you think about your opponent when you 're going through a match and how does that direct competition affect the way you approach a game ?
what are the best things that david felgate has helped you with ?
are you surprised he 's helped turn things around , that he could come in like that and make a difference ?
what has gone wrong this wimbledon ?
she was hitting some very good shots . was it very difficult for you to retrieve ?
anything waist high you were hitting the winners . anything lower than that was difficult for you to retrieve .
have you felt any extra pressure being no.1 ?
you had the reprieve two days ago . after that match , did you feel confident that you were going to be able to take advantage of that and do well here , or did you have concerns about the way you were playing ?
it seems like you still have n't found the right way to play on grass for your game yet , that you 're still looking for answers .
what is the one thing that you think you 've learned about being no.1 ?
we 've seen people come in here after shock defeats and be really down , really miserable . you 're really still quite bubbly and upbeat . are you a good actress , or are you philosophical ?
what do you feel you need specifically to improve your game enough to do well on grass ?
tipsarevic said , in explaining novak 's loss the other day , that everything is happening so fast to novak at such an early age . how does that compare to your situation ?
early in the year you gave us such wonderful insights into your thinking about psychology . have you thought about the psychology of being a champion , of realizing that you 're the french open winner , no.1 ? have you done any reading in that ?
and has it sunken in to you that you are the roland garros champion and no.1 ?
what does scott byrnes bring to your game ?
you have just played britain 's top woman 's player . do you think great britain is getting better ?
marathon first set . did you think it would be over very quickly after the first two games ?
your mom told me she thought you probably were n't all that happy with the way you played , and that you need to tighten up things , that you 're going to have to work on certain things . do you feel that way , and what do you think you have to work on ? or did mom say the wrong thing ?
serena and you come in at wimbledon , regardless of whether you 're playing really well before in the year , not so well , kind of mediocre , you are always considered the favorites , the two of you , you 're the really strong favorites . how does that make you feel , and is that how you think you both perceive yourselves ?
do you feel it more here ? obviously , this has been williams ownership for most of the last eight years .
how much change , if any , have you noticed in the grass in the time you 've been here coming as far as the speed of the rallies ?
do you have a preference as to faster , slower ? does it matter to you ?
you got the unexpected in the second set . you seemed to take a nasty smack in the face from one volley from anne . did that hurt ? were you a bit surprised she played that shot ?
it looked like you almost did n't see her ( raising hand apologetically ) .
how much more are you going to have to improve to go all the way in the tournament ?
so how far off do you feel you are at the moment ?
going back to when you got hit , what were you thinking at that moment and what were you thinking about your opponent ?
did you think there was anything more there ?
did you see what happened in yesterday 's ivanovic match when she saved a match point on a net cord ?
have you ever had a net cord decide a very important point in a match for you ?
you and serena often talk about what 's great about having a sister on the tour . one would imagine there has to be some kind of downside to that . what would that be , if somebody asked you ?
so far you 've had a bee attack you , a tennis ball in the head . are you worried what might come next ?
have you got any explanation for what went on out there today ?
is there any part of your game today you were happy with ?
why were you tentative ?
you suggested the other day that taking the time off between would be better , would be beneficial to you .
it seemed serving-wise you were a bit tentative . going down the middle some . did n't seem like backhand-wise you were feeling the stroke very well , just missing a couple inches on the cross-court .
with the time you took off after the french , did you see this coming at all ? did you have an inkling you might have a performance like this in you ?
would you rate this defeat , given the fact it 's at wimbledon , as the most disappointing in recent years for you ?
are you fully fit ?
the talk about what you were wearing , the fashion , did that play a distraction for you ?
did you know much about her before ? had you seen her play ? i know she played venus tight last year in the first round .
will you reconsider your grass court preparation now for next season ?
will you head straight home now , or will you have a few days in london ?
grass is one of the surfaces , if you 're not playing that well , where things can go almost too quickly .
especially it looked like on the court around the center stripes . the balls were just bouncing all over the place , on the lines , huh ?
what are your thoughts about replay at this point ?
there was a key overrule there at the end , eighth game , was it , in the second set ?
did you think at that point maybe you were going to get a foothold and turn it around ?
where the replay kept the game going .
you wound up winning the game .
pro players have so many hassles in their career , all the travel and the injuries , moments like this . what 's the toughest part of being a pro tennis player ? is it losses like this or something else ?
you seem a little bit bemused now . underneath that are you hurting ? you must be hurting .
ivanovic almost loses yesterday . you lose today . does it say that people who think it 's a clich that there really is depth on the women 's tour are wrong , that some of these younger players or even veterans can actually really play and pull off big wins on the day ?
best day of your life ?
what did you expect when you went out to play today ?
how much did you learn from your match at the french open last year , up 4-1 in the second set ? how much did that help you today ?
how did that help ?
was it just two points from beating venus ?
what was going through your mind at that point ?
coming into the match today you said to yourself , i 'm not going to do this again ?
based on your record this year , how could you be confident you could win today ? you have n't been successful in too many tournaments .
it 's reality .
is there a reason you have n't been very successful this year ?
how significant was it , especially to beat sharapova ?
why ?
sure . do you think there 's too much made of the fashion thing with her ?
what especially did n't you like about the outfit ?
you just do n't like the way it looks or you do n't like the idea of all the fashion stuff ?
did that give you motivation to beat her ?
do you live in miami or in boca ? how long have you been there ? where do you train ?
who is the coach ?
how long have you been with him ?
you train in boca at the evert academy , or where ?
what stage did you realize today that maria was really off her game and she was there for the taking ?
yes .
the no.1 player in the world gets pushed to two match points in the second round , and you knocked off the no.3 seed . what does that say about the women 's game ?
does it speak about the depth in the game that this can happen ? people say the women 's game is predictable . it has n't been predictable for the last two days .
how well do you know maria ?
personally .
what do you think she 'll make of your comments about her outfit ? will you seek her out afterwards ?
do you think she might take personally a bit your comments about her outfit ?
your father was a champion in wrestling . were you ever tempted to go into that instead ?
what level did your father reach in wrestling ?
when was that ?
have you ever pinned your father ?
pinned .
why did you hit him ?
you seemed like a pretty happy girl after you beat maria sharapova .
what did you say to yourself ?
maria said beating her probably will make your tournament . what 's your reaction to that ?
you might not win the tournament , but beating her will make your tournament .
you played very well . have you come to expect that or were you surprised by your performance today ?
what most pleased you about what you did ?
what did you have to do differently to win it ?
did she have some kind words for you afterwards ?
how did you feel , this game being broadcast live on tv , for your profile in the country ?
after four minutes you were 2-love down . how did you keep your belief then ?
eight .
how much did she surprise you with what she could do ?
who did you hit with ?
venus complimented you about your deep groundstrokes . is that something you will look to improve going into the hard court season ?
with your improved ranking , i guess the rest of the summer looks a little bit different for you . you said you were going to play the us open directly in . where do you go from here ?
do you know what the cutoffs are ?
how important is it for the women 's game to have someone like you in the first round on merit this year and for that to be the case next year , too ?
can you make the top 50 ?
how would you sum up the whole experience of the day ?
is there a part of you that went out there apprehensive about what could happen ? she 's blown very good players away on that court .
a lot of the crowd kept calling you anna . did this throw you at all ?
when you finished with the press conference here tuesday , what did you need to do with your knee ? what was the procedure from that point on ?
how did the 25 to 30 percent manifest itself ? what was the level of pain ?
disappointing when you were ready to play ?
how much were you able to do yesterday ?
you 're not concerned about the olympics then at this point ?
what 's the previous surgery ?
you 're thinking three to four weeks of not doing anything ?
we 've seen you get through 32 draws . do you come out of this wondering if you really can get through a 128 draw , your body ?
what are your plans after the olympics and new york ?
it seems like just the other day you were a rookie coming onto the tour . you 've had this long career . what are your thoughts about the shortness of so many careers these days , particularly justine ?
what 's changed most in your mind as far as when you were talking about retirement just a couple of years ago , and now it does n't seem you do talk about retirement at all ?
so how great is that fire right now ?
as you leave wimbledon , do you expect to be back here next year ?
is recovery going to be complicated by an active toddler ?
why new york ? why is that so important ?
single best memory from new york ?
can i ask you a general question ?
thanks . are you annoyed or angry that injury and pain seem to be such a prominent part of the job ? is that something you 'd like to see addressed , or ...
what do you recall about your wimbledon win 1999 ?
you were so close here in 2005. if you do n't get that other slam , will you be at peace with that ?
your return to the tour was greeted overwhelmingly positively by players , press , public alike . does it mean a lot to you that so many young players look up to you as a role model ?
can you give us an update on the jagger front .
does he have any awareness that mommy is ...
you referred to the surreal and luck aspects when you won here in '99 . what were your thoughts yesterday when ivanovic won the net cord that saved her ?
do you recall a net cord playing that big a role in any of your matches or any others that you had seen ?
could you please tell me a few words about urszula radwanska . was she a good opponent ?
two matches in , can you just talk about how you felt you played today and your level overall .
do you think about that , court 2 ?
could you hear those bones rattling around out there ?
how was the doubles yesterday ? did you enjoy that with venus ?
how has your mobility been tested so far , and what are your thoughts about it at this point ?
at this point in the tournament , the clich question is : are you where you want to be ? more specifically , what have you come in thinking you really needed to do well that you see you are doing well at ?
so in these early rounds , how much pressure is there on you that you put on yourself and have to avoid ?
how do you do that ? how do you relax ?
did you watch the marathon women 's match that was going on with ana ivanovic ?
will you be playing doubles with venus at the olympics and repeat the success from sydney ?
how do you feel like you 're serving ? your serve is such a great part of your game , can bail you out of trouble , particularly on this surface . do you think about coming into the tournament that your serve is going to be key to making a deep and successful run here ?
is it first-serve percentage , consistency , location ?
looks like you might play mauresmo in the next round , an experienced grass court player . has a one-handed backhand that will present some different challenges .
is that low slice problematic for you ?
do you feel lucky to have gotten out of that one ?
when you hit that forehand down match point , what did you think was going to happen ?
have you ever had a stroke of luck like that in a match before at such a vital point ?
what were you doing with your visor and your face right after the point ?
were you trying to hide your face with your expression ?
at the end of the match , what were you thinking when you went over to the net , and what did you do ?
you said she played well . do you think there was anything missing in your game ?
you 're a famously superstitious person . at that point , did you think it was your destiny to win the game ?
how did the length and difficulty of this match compare with all the other matches you 've ever played ?
what did you say to her after the match ? what are you thinking for her at this time ?
did this experience today teach you anything about how strong you are mentally that you did n't know before ? did it surprise you in any way that you could prevail ?
did you feel bad about the hat situation as well , when her hat flew off ?
did you actually complain at that point ?
as the world no.1 , do you feel under more pressure to show mental toughness ?
how do you think you 'll look back on this match in the weeks , months , years to come ?
how much has this taken out of you physically , bearing in mind you have five matches more if you 're going to win wimbledon ?
you mentioned keeping your focus and your mental toughness . how do you do that over three and a half hours ?
are you still feeling lucky about these championships , or do you feel you 've used your luck up ?
how well do you think you played today ?
when you were at match point and you saw her hit her forehand , what did you think was going to happen ?
how about after that ? what did it do to you , seeing that happen ?
did you see what she did at the end of the match , walking up to the net ?
yes .

what were you thinking about her good fortune ?
at the end of the match you sat down and put a towel over your head . what happened next ?
were you disappointed that the umpire made you forfeit that point at that crucial time in the third set ?
is that someone upstairs as well not smiling on you ?
you said you did n't know much about naomi . how surprised were you with her level in the first set ?
how much of what happened in the first set was down to her level of play and you not playing your best ?
when you played well here , you had you to work out some cobwebs early in the tournament . did you feel like that at all in this match today ?
how did you feel your level was today ?
this is the fifth time you 've walked out on that court as defending champ . can you describe your feelings when you walk out , whether it 's special , different , more special ?
do you think it 's fair that the men get to play on a perfectly brand-new court when roger defends every year and you get the worn-over court the next day ? would you like to see them switch every year ?
you do n't think there 's something special to be the first one to play on the court every year like he is ?
how much of a distraction was the bee early on ? you were swishing around .
just once .
talking about an early challenge and a wake-up call like this in the first set being a good thing , right through the tournament or just for the match ?
last year you were a very outspoken advocate for the equal prize money . could you speak about the level of satisfaction you feel about how that 's turned out . also , if billie jean king played a role in your views of that issue and your potential role in advocating for that issue .
what is your work with unesco ?
serena was saying yesterday when asked about obama , she said , i admire him , but we 're jehovah 's witness . we ca n't vote . you 're out there doing political issues all the time .
you 're talking about unesco , equal prize money . if you 're out there advocating for an issue you 're taking some kind of political stance . how do you feel about that ?
unesco .
but you do n't vote either ?
you have another british player in the next round , anne keothavong . are you aware of her ?
the atmosphere in the crowd out there today was fantastic , mainly because it was a british player . do you enjoy that ?
were you ever actually concerned today ? were you ever really worried ?
to what extent do you think physical fitness was a factor today ? it appeared in the second set your superior mobility was a telling factor .
the governing bodies of tennis are taking a stronger look at issues pertaining to gambling and match fixing . if someone is caught involved in fixing a match , what do you think the penalty should be ?
what message do you think is being sent by this increased scrutiny ?
you brought out a new clothes line here , but you have petrova wearing your clothes , right ?
is that the first time you 've had another player wearing your clothes ? talk about how you worked that out with her .
is it the same outfit you 're wearing , or is it different ?
know eleven trench coat ?
did you have a hand in designing the dress you wore today ? if so , is there an element in the dress you particularly liked ?
if naomi was to ask you , what do i need to get to your level , what would you tell her ?
what 's the greatest strength of your father as a coach ?
what do you feel his greatest strength is in terms of his knowledge of tennis ?
have you been able to see maria sharapova 's tuxedo outfit ? if so , what do you make of it ?
what would you say was the difference between your first-set performance and your second-set performance ?
as a champion so many times , how comfortable do you feel here ? we always say it 's like your second home and all that . when you come here , does it very comfortable for you ?
do you feel like a different player here at this tournament ?
why especially this year ?
do you remember the first time you ever played on grass , whether you liked it right away , or was it an acquired taste ?
was that in florida that you played on grass the first time ?
one down , six more to go ?
feel comfortable out there ?
quite an eye-catching outfit .
i 'm wondering , how much do you test drive an outfit before you approve it ? is it comfortable to play in ? how much did you test it ?
what inspired the white tuxedo look ?
what will you wear next year then , if you already know ?
with all due respect , that top takes a certain type of body to pull that off . do you really expect that to be a big seller off the rack ?
what did you think of serena 's raincoat and roger 's cardigan ?
you spoke in new york with the black dress of your love of audrey hepburn , breakfast at tiffany 's . talk about tuxedos .
did you expect anything else ?
that 's the point .
not to bore you with a tennis question .
in australia you started playing well early , got off to a fast start , played great all the way through . in france , you kind of tried to work your way through . it 's clay . did n't work as well . today you 're playing well . did you feel like coming in that 's important for you to start playing well early , get a feel for the ball , maybe your game will come ?
do you think all the attention to the fashion , is it more the players that happen to be at the top now , that you 're all sort of fashion conscious and savvy , or is it more marketing by the tour ? it 's really relatively new that we talk so much about what the people are wearing , especially the women .
i 'm saying in the last few years , though .
could you sew one yourself , do you think ?
what do you think of nike ? they really are a little bit of a risk-taker . they work with federer , serena . have you been to their campus in oregon ?
what are your thoughts about their people and their approach in the market ?
on the flipside , have they ever brought in a concept where you shook your head ?
are you going to carry the flag for russia at the opening ceremony ?
speaking of russia , you were talking about the football team on saturday . they 're through to the semifinals . how does that motivate you ?
are russians prouder now than a few years ago ?
another good step forward for you .
you seemed to come back refreshed in the second set .
was it nerves that you played so badly in the first set ?
did you actually feel different coming in because you came in on your ranking ?
do you feel in any way a kind of inspiration to the other players doing well behind you ?
what are your thoughts on facing venus williams , and how will you prepare ?
what is the key for you to do as well as you can against her , do you think ?
will you watch a tape perhaps of your countrywoman 's match today ?
and maybe discuss it with her ?
playing venus at wimbledon is the good thing about your job . you also have been through some difficult times this year . can you talk about what happened when you won the tournament in lebanon .
were you afraid for your safety while you were there ?
how can you keep your concentration and go on and win the tournament ?
on a lighter note , it seems you have a shopping problem . just wondering , after a result like today , would you go out tomorrow and have a little spending spree .
anything you 're looking forward to buying if you do progress and get a bit of extra crash ?
you 're the best britain has , yet we still seem to be some way behind the rest of the world . do you have any thoughts on what needs to be done to bridge that gap ?
what will be your focus once wimbledon is over ? will you be looking to progress in the us open , the olympics ?
how high do you think you could get in the rankings ultimately ?
do you think you can get yourself onto the main tour ?
it 's taken you quite a long time to get to this stage . did you ever think you were n't going to make it ?
is there one factor this year that 's helped you progress to your highest ever ranking ?
before this year i think you 'd only won one match in the main draw . do you have any sympathy for alex bogdanovic who has lost every time he 's come here ?
does the crowd sometimes put pressure on you ? does it hinder as much as help playing here as a brit ?
how might that affect your thinking as you play venus , having the crowd behind you ?
would you prefer to play on centre court or would you prefer somewhere more intimate ?
usually at a tennis tournament you have to worry about your opponent 's backhand . in lebanon , what happened ? you said there was a touch of panic . what occurred ?
the fear of the unknown , what would occur ?
but you were glad to get to syria ?
what will your preparations be now ? can you get any time to relax and maybe switch off a little bit ?
can you beat venus ?
pretty diverse workout . seemed to be a bit everything in the match .
up at the net , running around a lot , entertaining points .
you 've been playing a little bit less recently . do you feel more refreshed than you did this time last year ?
when you say you 're refreshed , is that a physical thing or a mental thing or a bit of both ?
the no.1 ranking is up for grabs again here . from paris , have you gained anything ? did you get an experience which might help to let you be the one ?
what did you want to accomplish today in the first round ?
give us an update on the kid .
two-handed backhand ?
he 's not traveled here ?
how are you finding that ? does that help you , do you think , stay focused ?
did you think you 'd be back here ?
it looked like your knee was kind of a problem or was bothering you , and then you had the trainer come out . can you tell us where you feel you 're at ?
is the course of action not to maybe practice as much ?
what was the doctor able to detect ?
the first few months you were back everything went right , beautifully right . now the last few months have been a little bumpier . does that part of your voyage remind of why you stepped away in the first place ?
they put about five pounds of tape on your right knee . do you think then nike would then put a logo on that ?
what kind of follow-up tests might be needed on the knee ?
at the beginning of the match , did you have the wrap on the calf from the start ?
did that bother you ?
when you 're packing for wimbledon now with your son , do you bring a lot of stuff ? do you rent things here ? do you bring a lot of toys ?
you 're a playing mom . were you surprised by the amount of playing dads you know around ?
as you probably know , the men 's tour is having a lot of political difficulties right now , including the biggest complaint , a communications disconnect between the chairman and the leadership of the players . how has the wta avoided any communications disconnect ?
how does he stay in touch with the top players on the tour ?
you feel like you 're right in the loop of all the major decisions ?
did it feel kind of like you 're starting a new season because it 's been so long since you played a match on tour ?
how much of the french open did you watch ?
as you may know , tiger woods just had this incredible performance with a problematic knee . were you aware of that , and could you reflect on that ?
when you do have an injury , in some way does it just really increase your concentration even more ?
scouting report on gisela dulko .
it sounds like you 've lowered your expectations quite a bit , maybe not just for this tournament , but in general . is that tough for a former no.1 , three-time grand slam champion , saying , i might get to the second week , maybe not , and if i do n't , that 's okay ?
intimating .
that 's my feeling .
can you talk about the olympics and why that 's so important to you ?
how is it different , winning an olympic medal versus a slam ?
are you going to play doubles ? if so , with who ?
the no.1 player in the world happens to be chosen , so that would be a pretty good pairing , i would think .
describe the feeling you had on the podium when they started playing the star spangled banner .
you were pretty young .
what about the near disaster of losing the medal itself . where is it now ?
this comes up with lot with the men because of the big serves , but how much do you think the surface has slowed here ?
is that the ball or is it the surface ?
you talked about the rankings , where the williams sisters are . if you look further down below you , there seems to be quite a substantial gap . do you have any insight as to why you think that might be ? is it something you think experienced players like yourself , when you 're no longer playing , can rectify to bring the next generation through ?
can you give us your thoughts on that match , in particular the first four games when you were leading the defending champion 3-1 ?
what was going through your mind when you 're looking at the scoreboard and it shows 3-1 in that set ?
venus has just advised you to get richard williams as a coach to get you up to her level . what do you think of that ?
why were you so relaxed ?
what do you think you 'd have to do if you drew venus here next year better to beat her ?
you did produce an amazing level of tennis in that first set . it was really , really good . why do you think your results on the tour do n't reflect that level of tennis ?
at the last minute you thought you better give a wave to the crowd . they really responded to that .
will you talk to anne now before she plays venus in the second round ?
what was the major difference between the two sets ?
venus said she always plays her best tennis as the match progresses . do you think you play your best tennis at the beginning of a match , or is there not really a rule of thumb ?
do you sense there is a bit of a broader revival , albeit a fairly modest one , amongst the british women ? how helpful is it a fact there are actually a number of you pushing together as opposed to the isolated person ?
twelve months ago you had two match points against martina hingis . are you a better player now than you were then , even if the rankings do n't suggest as much ?
is the hardest thing now going from in front of 15,000 to playing in front of 5,000 or whatever it is at your next tournament ?
if you draw the wimbledon champion in the first round next year , are you going to beat her ?
would you have taped the match from the bbc today ? did you have anybody to record it for you ? will you watch it again ?
the reason i ask , is i know tracy austin and john mcenroe were saying afterwards were very complimentary . they said there are areas to improve , but you will take a lot from that presumably when you listen to that .
would you say you raise your game when you play here ? if so , would you put that down to the crowd or other factors ?
do you feel like you 're playing with a lot more people ? do you feel you have the country behind you a little bit more when you 're on centre court ?
when you come back next year , would you be hopeful of getting where anne is this year and get straight into the main draw ?
was this an example of having to play yourself into a match , get used to things basically ?
the trench coat , was that an effort to keep the rain away this year ?
it looked almost carnaby street inspired . was it a '60s retro look .
it 's not necessarily a piece of athletic attire . did you have to get any special permission from the club to wear it ?
is it going to keep the rain away , do you think ?
can you tell us about the fabric ? it 's hard to tell if it 's very lightweight or heavy or porous .
you 've been at this for a long time . do you think you and your sister would still be doing this without each other ? do you see yourself eventually both leaving at the same time because of that when it comes time to do that ?
a lot has been made that roger federer could lose , this might be the end of his dynasty , et cetera . you and your sister have been up and down , struggling . do you look and say , we have a year or two or three here left at wimbledon , we better get going , or do you play it day to day ?
last time we saw you were pretty low in paris . tough match . how did you recover from that ? how do you feel about being back on the grass in general ?
what is `` serena recovering '' ?
did you fly economy like venus ?
the new poll shows that 90 % of white people in the usa are comfortable with a black president . i want to ask you about the presidential election . you must be excited .
justine 's absence creates sort of a void with a great champion . do you think there 's something lost aesthetically with her not in it , her size , the one-handed backhand ?
the decision by you and venus to play doubles this year , is that partially with the olympics in mind or you were wanting to do that on its own merits ?
the match was 5-all in the first set , breakpoint against you . what is going through your mind ? how big obviously was that point as the match turned out ?
are you glad to have a first match like that rather than a 1-1 match ? do you think that helps you down the road ?
in general you peak at the majors . this year your best tennis has been in between the two majors . can you talk a little bit about that and how you approach wimbledon this year .
so doing your 'serena recovery ' period , thinking about what happened in paris , obviously not one of your better matches , what were you thinking about your own performance and why that would happen ?
did you practice on grass at all back in florida ?
once you get over here , how big is the adjustment for you ?
any thoughts on roger 's cardigan ?
exactly how do you and venus prepare ? you do n't play a tournament after the french . i do n't know if you ever played a tournament before here . what goes on and how do you try to get yourself ready for this event ?
is it nice to get the first one out of the way ?
have you noticed a difference in the expectation levels now from a year ago ?
what are those expectations ?
what are some of the benefits of being no.1 ?
is it something that you relish , being no.1 , the pressures that come with being no.1 ? is that something you enjoy ?
being no.1 suggests you are the best here . do you feel like you are the best here ?
how much does your game improve through the two weeks ?
these two weeks to come how much are you going to be improving your game ?
how did you find rossana as an opponent ?
what parts of your grass court game are better this year than they were last year ?
do you have the time to look over the press here in england ? do you see all the pictures that are published about you , or you do n't see them ?
not even when they make compliments or put nice pictures ?
since winning roland garros and becoming no.1 , what is the one thing that has changed that surprised you the most ?
when you were not no.1 , when you played against the no.1 seed , how did you approach the game ?
what was going through your mind at the end ?
says a lot you can come through a match as tough as that at the end .
there is a bit of a rough deal in ntc , lta , about your split from alun jones .
has it been too easy to knock them ? is it time to give them a bit of credit now , the lta ?
what are you changing with the nutrition ?
have you had to cut anything out that you particularly like eating ?
what type of pizza ?
are you able to tell us how much you lost ?
you spent a long time in the gym , as well ?
you 're a very emotional person . do you tend to burst into tears when you 're watching films , reading books ?
can you remember the last time you cried ?
what about ?
you played a very entertaining match against kuznetsova last week in eastbourne . how does that make you feel , that you can really trouble a grand slam champion ?
based on today , do you think you have good chances to go deeper ?
about five players in the top 200. are you optimistic for the future of the british women 's game ?
do you think there 's going to be a bit more pressure on you now , a brit in the second round ? are you ready for it ?
when you 've had so many setbacks , have you ever thought , i just ca n't do this any more ?
do you think you tend to play your best tennis when your back 's against the wall ?
would your father have been there today ? and given his past as a professional sportsman , does he sort of play any role ? do you talk to him a lot about what you 're doing , or has he stepped back ?
are you going to be able to celebrate with a slice of pizza tonight ? are you allowed ?
was anyone else here supporting you today ? do you have a boyfriend ? what happened with the towel at the end ?
do you have a boyfriend ?
what happened with the towel ?
you were talking about how much you went through physically and emotionally . does it make you a bit fed up when players say english girls do n't want it enough ? clearly you do .
how would you rate this win with your nine other grand slams ?
why were you so dominant ?
why did you feel like you needed to win ? what made you need the win ?
dinara said the prospect of the no.1 ranking was too much for her , caused her to be very nervous . how did it affect you ?
you 're now halfway to another serena slam . is that a realistic goal for you , and have you thought of another name for it ?
would you say that was one of your most dominant performances of your career ?
was it as good as your 2007 win ?
how do you explain the difference between your form tonight ? how did you get up for the final ?
should we be surprised or maybe worried a little bit when a set in a grand slam final could be won at love ?
we 've been waiting for you a little bit . the way you 're dressed , you look like someone else is waiting for you . where are you going ?
did you feel like you were in control of the match from the very first point ?
did you sense she was struggling with the occasion straightaway ?
did you work on return of serve a lot this morning in practice ?
how many tournaments are you planning to play this year ? the full schedule ?
you 're somebody who puts emphasis on particular events , grand slams , a few others . what is the next event for you that you put an asterisk at ?
ten slams in , the highest-earning female sportsperson in the world . do you have any kind of benchmarks that , you yourself , are trying to make ?
and is the key to that this balance in life ?
what is going to be your schedule after this tournament ? are you going to be in rome also ?
what does it mean to you to be the highest earner not only in tennis but overall ?
you 're talking about hanging around for a while . do you suppose you could hang around long enough to equal margaret court 's record of 24 grand slam championships ?
yes .
you have been around for a long time , one of the elder stateswomen of the game . what do you think are the lessons of this tournament , the australian open , what are the issues as far as treatment of injuries on court , roof policy , heat policy ? anything you 'd like to see changed ?
how do you see the men 's final ?
would you ever want to play a 5 hour , 14 minute match ?
would you want to play 5 hours and 14 minutes ever ?
was it just simply a bad case of nerves tonight ?
is there anything you can take out of the match for the future ?
how did you feel before the match ? did you feel ready to go ?
when it finished , did you feel like going out and playing again ?
could you tell that after a couple points , the double-faults , that felt wrong then ?
how long do you think she can stay no.1 if she performs like this tonight ?
do you feel anger besides disappointment ?
did you feel you played yourself back into the match when you broke serena early in the second ?
you said that sometimes when you go out there and play , you play yourself , and sometimes you play the opponent . who did you think you were playing today ?
do you think she played well today ?
how difficult is it to bounce back from something like this ?
can you compare the disappointment you feel now to what you felt in paris ?
when you were waiting for the ceremony , serena made you smile again . what did you talk about ?
playing serena , does she make you doubt yourself more than other players ?
you said you 're going to go out and work on your serve from tonight 's match . how long will it take you to get over a loss like this ?
is she the best player you 've ever played against ? would you rate her that high ?
have you heard from marat yet ?
looked like a very tight match . what was the difference between your game and dinara 's ?
there were a lot of breakpoints and breaks . was it difficult out there ?
your first grand slam semifinal . looking forward , what do you take out of today 's match and the tournament generally ?
do you prefer the indoor conditions to the outdoor conditions ?
did you have a chance to practice indoors before your match today ?
looking back on this tournament , are you satisfied with your performance ?
when you were talking about different things you could have done , do you think , for example , maybe slice shots because she does n't like that very much ?
what about your game do you think could improve and see you in more grand slam semifinals or perhaps moving on to finals in the future ?
no fed cup for you next week ?
what was the match like for you ?
what was your game plan before the match today ?
a perfect match for you ?
you appeared very much in control of the game . did you ever feel that you were in danger ?
playing under the roof , do you think that suits your game better with the perfect , still conditions ?
you do n't think you have any extra edge when it 's under the roof ?
how did you find the atmosphere ? it was quite quiet out there for a semifinal .
when you felt how hot it was when you first went out today , were you happy to see they made the decision to keep the roof closed ?
when you are preparing to play outside , do you do any of that precooling , like dunking in cold water or stuff that they advise ?
you have a shot to be no.1 again here . at this point in your career , how important is it for you to not only get there but stay there for a while ?
she 's very tough on the run . seemed like today you said you were not going to concede the side-to-side rallies ?
that little tumble looked like it hurt a little bit .
what does it mean to you to have another shot at the title ?
but history is important , too ? you want to get there ?
you said you have been consistent in the slams , but you have n't been that consistent in this tournament . now today you performed pretty well . many times you do n't play too well the first rounds , then you go on playing much better at the end .
do you think that happens because in christmas vacation maybe you do n't practice that hard , and practice here while you play in the tournament ?
what did you do better today ? you lost to her not so long ago . what parts of your game do you feel you stepped up today ?
you may play safina . can you just talk about that matchup . also talk about vera .
if you won the tournament , you 'd be in a select group that have won 10 grand slam singles titles . what would that mean to you to get to double figures ?
meal or mail ?
you mentioned roger federer after the game . how much of that was jest and how much have you seriously sort of been inspired by his form this tournament ?
who would you most like to receive a letter from if you reach that club ? who would you like to write you ?
was there any point during the last 12 days where you thought , maybe , maybe my best form is not going to come and i 'm going to have to scratch out every single match ?
how do you keep your focus between now and the final ?
what was the key to your win today ? what do you think you did better than she did ?
was it an ideal match to go into a final ?
how much of this do you owe to justine henin ? since you beat her last year , you 've become a whole new player .
but still , that victory , i think , gave you the confidence that you perhaps lacked before .
here you are where she was five years ago , and you pushed her into retirement .
in that same tournament you also beat serena williams . do you think that will help you going into the final ?
do you think at the us open and the championships when you played her , you just were n't physically or mentally prepared for it ?
in all the matches so far you 've been the higher seed and probably the favorite . is it going to be easier on you to play a final against someone who is seeded higher and has won a lot of majors already ?
a lot of errors today . do you put that down to the aggression that you were talking about ?
yeah , 41 unforced errors . do you put that down to the aggressive style that you put into winning the game ?
serena lost the last three times to dementieva . you had lost the last three times to zvonareva . how do you explain how everything changed ? you think it 's a reason or coincidence ?
what would it mean to you to be a grand slam champion for the first time ?
saturday night is a long way away . what will you do in between times ?
do you get nervous at all ?
when you play serena , how hard is it not to play against her reputation , given that she tends to raise her level and play great in grand slam finals ?
if you would have the choice , would you prefer to play with the roof open or closed ? does that make any difference to you ?
but it 's going to be saturday night .
does n't make any difference to the game ? svetlana said , for instance , that it was a huge advantage for serena to play kind of indoors because of her serve .
where would you have to improve today , if anywhere , to win on saturday night ?
we are too far ahead , of course , but when marat won his first grand slam he had some chilled vodka brought in . i 'm just wondering what your preferred celebration beverage might be if that happens .
vodka .
afterwards ? if you won ?
when your brother won here and the us open , it was a big celebration in your parents ' house , i imagine . what about you ? would they celebrate in the same way , or a little less because they 're getting used to the triumph of your brother ? and do you think they expect more from your brother or from yourself ?
my question was if you think they expected more of him or you to win , and it would make a difference for them ?
if you think back to earlier in the week when you were so angry with yourself after the cornet match , can you actually believe now that you got to the final ?
are you planning to bring one day a bunch of boyfriends to cheer for you ?
was it a match of lost opportunities and frustration ?
you beat her pretty handily not so long ago . what was the difference in this match from her ?
is it tougher to play her indoors in perfect conditions ?
what about your service ? you served a number of double-faults at perhaps crucial times .
what positives do you take out of the match today ?
was that an unusual pressure for you , having had so many on the run ?
was it an unusual feeling to not have lost all the way through ?
was it your worst performance of the year so far , or did serena just play better ?
where do you go from here now ?
if serena plays at that level , do you expect her to win the tournament ?
should the roof have been closed a little earlier ?
you spoiled the all-russian party .
did the roof closing help you ?
how would you describe the heat ?
how do you think you played ? were you happy with your game today ?
where do you get your inspiration for your outfits ?
who designed your sister 's dress ?
it 's fair that maybe you 're not playing at the best of your game , i think .
how encouraging that you 're here in the semifinals ?
can you remember a hotter day than today in your career ?
where was that ?
how quickly did it cool down once the roof was closed ?
you 've mentioned previously that obama , the inauguration , really inspired you . do you think it impacted your game today , like helping you out mentally ?
the weather is supposed to be hotter tomorrow . would you like to see the organizers take their decision to close the roof before you went out there ?
you have singles and doubles tomorrow . that should be tough to deal with .
playing elena next .
what are you going to have to do differently against her ? you 've lost the last three times you played her .
if you win this tournament , you 're going to get back to no.1 . how important is it at this stage in your career to hold the top ranking ? or is it just about winning ?
elena said playing against you is a mental battle . do you feel the same way ?
she said playing against you was a mental battle ; that it was n't really about forehands or backhands . do you feel like playing against you is a mental battle or something else ?
television commentators said you had your racquets restrung between the first and second sets .
how do you keep your mind away from the heat ? do you think of ice baths ?
so your racquets were in trouble today ; you were in trouble . if the roof did n't close , do you think you would have lost the match ?
every year you 've gone and won here , you 've either come back from match points down or had an opponent serve for the match . that happened again today . would you look at that as a good omen going into the next couple of rounds ?
you were playing well outdoors on hardcourts last year . why do you think you 're having a harder time getting your level up ?
does n't it surprise you that with like victoria or novak , that players of their caliber kind of wilted and had to retire in matches , that they would feel it that badly ?
do you think it has something to do with how people train , whether they can handle the heat , or just an individual thing ?
when your opponent is serving for the match , can you give us an idea what you 're thinking at that point ? do you think she 's going to be nervous ? what are you feeling ?
do you fly coach ?
are you mentally strong because you 're fascinated by punk rock music ?
did the closing of the roof greatly affect your chances of winning ?
what were the conditions ? you obviously prepared , did you , for the conditions today ?
some people that were in the tunnel when you came off court suggested that you were a little bit angry to have been brought off court . is that correct ?
who are you angry at ?
did you ask the referee ?
is it difficult for you and the other players to understand how the rule on heat works here ?
was it especially surprising for you that you started with an open roof and then during the match they closed it ?
in your heart of hearts , do you think if the roof stayed open you would have won the game ?
did you feel okay out there ? you did n't feel any physical discomfort or danger ?
yes .
when you were looking at serena down the other end , did you detect she was having trouble in the heat ?
you were serving for the match still .
what do you take away from the tournament , what positives ?
do you think somebody from your country will go on and win the title ?
it looked an easy win . but really , how tough was it ?
they 're closing the roof now . do you think they should have closed it before your match ?
is that the hottest you 've ever played in ?
did anyone give you any explanation why it was n't being closed ?
do you or any of the other players you know understand the heat policy here , how it works ?
you have to back up again tomorrow in a semifinal . how much impact will this have on you ?
is it fair you had to play your whole match in the sun and the match going on now played only one set in the sun ?
does it give an advantage to whoever wins today 's match heading into the next ?
while it 's difficult conditions , does it make you feel good that you 've shown your hard work and physical condition has coped with these difficult weather conditions ?
do you find yourself going for bigger shots to shorten rallies because of the conditions ?
last year 's champion is n't here , but we 're looking at a possibility of an all-russian semifinals . your thoughts on that ?
if serena wins , can you just talk about how you turn that rivalry around ? you 've beaten her three times in a row . is it your better play , or have you found something in her game that works for you now ?
you had your visor on and she did n't have a hat of any kind . were you a bit surprised ?
yes .
could you have played today without your visor ?
a bit of sun strike in your eyes a few times . the sun on the court , was that an issue today ?
were the moths an issue for you ?
the men have been complaining about having to play very late matches this week , and suggesting with the equal pay the women should play every second night after the men . how do you feel about that ?
the men said maybe every second night the men should play before the women in the night sessions .
a few of them have said that . roger . andy roddick . novak . baghdatis .
have you talked to your mum since the match finished ?
how is she ?
is she well ?
any indication she might come out now ?
was she able to watch ?
did she have any comments ?
does she get as nervous at home on television as she does when she 's siting in the stands ?
do you expect she 'll be back on the tour with you soon ?
you said she was n't happy with your serve . how did you assess your own serve today ?
how much of playing serena is a mental battle versus a physical and technical one ?
we now know the no.1 ranking is going to change hands after this tournament . is that something on your mind that would make winning the title a bit more special ?
you were down 3-1 , and then you reeled off 11 consecutive games . what happened ?
yet to drop a set . is this the best you 've played in a tournament ?
your semifinal opponent plays tonight . you played today in the heat . is that unfair ?
will you be watching tonight ?
how do you think jelena will go against dinara ?
seems to be a very open tournament . have you thought about the possibility of winning it ?
marion 's take on today was that you just played amazing tennis , it was all down to you . is that how you saw it or were you surprised you did n't get a better fight ?
how tough is it to keep playing at that level ? is it difficult to retain your concentration in that situation ?
you said you were n't happy with your match against cornet . mentally you were n't quite with it . how was tonight 's game ?
did you go in today with a game plan ?
what do you think about dokic 's future in the game ? do you think she can get up to the top of the women 's game again ?
you played once six years ago . can you make comparisons to her game then and now ?
can you compare her game now to other players you 're playing on circuit , other top players ?
that experience , you being out there with the crowd , does that help you ?
is that a match you would have won a year or two years ago ?
are you happy with your level of aggressivity today , or do you need to get more aggressive to win this tournament ?
do you let yourself dream about finally winning one ?
what about no.1 ? you smell that a little bit yet ?
do you feel like your own worst enemy out there sometimes ? is it sort of you against yourself sometimes ?
have you been in contact with your brother over the last few days , and has he given you any advice as you get towards the business end ?
tell me again , where did you spend the off-season ? you lost seven kilos or something like that .
where were you training in the off-season ?
what do you think is the difference in your condition . i know you lost seven kilos . do you physically feel anything different ?
it 's not easy .
your next opponent has been in great form . she has n't dropped a set all tournament . how do you see that matchup ?
looking forward , what do you take out of this match ?
did the ankle play any part ? how has that been ?
so no disruption ?
how do you sum up this whole experience of the past week ?
you were really tired after the other match the other night . how well did you pull up for tonight ?
can you tell us what you learned personally about yourself and where you 're at in life ?
has it given you a sense of where you 're at in life now ?
does this result give you the confidence as you approach the bigger tournaments and maybe ask for wild cards and rather than playing some of the smaller events to build your ranking up ?
do you have to reassess your goals now ? you said you wanted to get yourself in the top 100. will you reassess now ?
can you say what this week has done in terms of your belief that you made the right choice in coming back to tennis ?
you said before that you 're not in the best shape that you could be . how long will it be before we see you at a 100 % ?
did the roller coaster ride that everyone took with you , did that take you by surprise ?
take us through that call .
you talk about your boyfriend 's support during your comeback . what 's he been like during the tournament here ?
you 've had great results at wimbledon and the french open in the past . what do you think is your best surface ?
optimistically looking forward to your next grand slam and wimbledon ?
have you spoken to any of your fed cup teammates this week ? and have they told you how they feel about you coming back into the tomorrow ?
it 's been such a tournaments of so many highs for you . how will you cope with the possibility of an emotional letdown going into other tournaments where you wo n't have your home crowd behind you ?
you led 3-1 in the first set . what happened after that ?
was it very hot out there ?
vera is yet to drop a set . can she go all the way ?
were you shocked how well things had gone two days previously and how badly they went today ?
were you distressed after the first set when you went for the ice ?
what 's the problem with the wrist ? how serious is the problem ?
you get an x-ray tomorrow ?
to get so far in the tournament for the first time , then be forced to withdraw , how do you feel ?
you got so far in the tournament . previously you were out in the first round . you were in the fourth round , playing well , had to withdraw , how disappointing is it ?
can you run us through your injury , how you did it ?
what was wrong with your left hand ?
have you had a physician look at it ?
have you had this problem before or did it just happen today ?
with your retirement , there 's now been three others today , is tennis becoming so arduous that we 're going to get more and more of these retirements ?
i understand you had a hit after the match . is that a good substitute for on-court play ?
right after the match , you said to brad that you wanted to check on victoria to see how she was doing . did you have a chance to do that ?
what was your sense as to what happened ?
did you have any injury concerns yourself during the match ?
did you retape your right ankle yourself ?
the trainer retaped one .
self-service .
you were real frustrated with your serve , obviously , at the end of the first set . you got the code violation . what was going on with the rhythm there ?
did you feel you were turning it around or were you fortunate ?
did your mom or dave or someone say in the first set you were n't moving your feet like you normally do ? seemed you were a little lethargic off the ground .
a question broader than the match itself . you joke about being able to do it all . what are the benefits of not being solely focused upon tennis all the time and exploring other things the way you have ? what are the benefits of that ?
svetlana kuznetsova in the next round . thoughts on that matchup ?
do you feel like she 's someone that can go toe-to-toe with you at times ?
do you feel like a natural at tennis or do you think that you become good or great based on hard work ?
comparing to what you were saying about design or drawing or other things where you have to work harder .
obviously good early on beating andy roddick when he was 10 years old . any hopes of a charity rematch ?
the score speaks for itself . what was the score ?
what was andy like as a 10-year-old kid ? was he a brat or a good kid ?
the latest chapter in the dokic drama unfolded last night . did you see it ?
how do you see the safina matchup ?
you saw jelena during her so-called `` prime years . '' looks like now she has n't lost her ball-striking ability .
we 've seen when you have n't felt that comfortable off the ground , your serve has carried you through majors . can the reverse happen ?
if you do n't want to play andy in a charity match , maybe a dump-truck-pressing contest ?
did you hear about the dump-truck-pressing comment he made ?
his exact comment was that , at the time he had to run around in the shower to get wet while you were bench pressing dump trucks .
can you imagine jim morrison from the doors is still alive , would you like to sing a song with him ?
bass guitar ?
do you do windows ?
washing windows .
what kind of guitar do you have ?
andy roddick has been in the top 10 for seven straight years . i know you can appreciate that consistency . can you talk about him as a competitor .
will you watch his match against djokovic ? or because he 's your friend , does he get too emotionally draining ?
would you like to play mixed doubles with him ?
what are your thoughts on the early finish ? did you need more match play , or is it a blessing in disguise ?
are you somewhat of the quiet achiever in the draw ? you 're not getting any publicity . are you happy with your form and how you 're playing ?
you play serena williams next . your thoughts on that game ?
i do n't know your record against serena , but i remember your match in miami last year .
the miami match was a terrific match .
it was n't very much difference between the two of you . a match like that should give you confidence you can beat her .
what about the way she plays , her game style , how it fits into how you play , players you like or do n't like to play ?
what as olga brought to your game ?
she really was the first soviet , russian player , when she came along . does she tell you stories about how tough it was ?
what do you think about china 's player today ?
how far are you from your best ? is that your best match you played today ?
if you win here , you 'll become no.1 . is that motivating you now ?
i think you 've had 40 matches on the trot . you 've had a great start to the season . any secret to the kind of form you 're having ?
you 're getting a little more into your preparation . did you do anything special ?
it 's been 10 years since your first grand slam here . does that feel a long time ago ?
do you remember your thoughts 10 years on where your career would be ?
dinara said yesterday that you were probably the player to beat ; you were probably the favorite of this tournament . how do you look at that ? do you find it kind ? is it a bit more embarrassing maybe ?
do you like to be in that position ? is it a reward to your game ? do you look at it differently saying you do n't want the pressure ?
a lot of people other than dinara have picked you to win here before the tournament . is it comforting to know that people still believe you will win a major ?
was it more relaxing for you to play out there today ?
was your first match against hingis , center court ?
you looked up to her quite a bit when you were younger , too ?
is it a good thing to get over the fourth round ? you 've been there a few times . now you 're a bit further . is that comforting ?
do you have any thoughts on the no.1 ranking ? with jelena losing yesterday , if certain results go your way , you could be no.1 by the end of the tournament .
what do you think of carla suarez ?
are you surprised to find her here ?
your matches often , at one time , included a great many double-faults . you seem to have put that behind you . is that your thinking , that you 're no longer troubled by those ?
what happened ?
the flu ?
with a virus , you were playing good tennis in the first set .
did you feel close to fainting ?
must be encouraged by your performance in the tournament thus far , despite all that .
did the doctor advise food or something to drink to see you through that match ?
in the second set you won the first game , and the second game you had four game points for a 2-love lead . do you suppose if you would have converted one of those four points you would have wanted to stick around ?
was the heat a factor ? you went into the shade between every point .
has this happened to you ever before ?
how do you feel now ?
when you left the court for the injury timeout , did they try to give you some medications ?
what happened when you came off the court ? i heard you were placed on a drip .
what happened when you came off the court ? i heard you were on a drip at one stage .
do you think the rules should be changed for this kind of situation , especially this late in a match , if it 's not your fault , to give you more time to recover ?
was it your experience that got you through in the end ?
she served for the match at 5-4 and you broke her back .
what was going through your mind ? what tactics were you thinking ?
can you pick yourself up for the next match ?
it 's not the first time you 've had matches where you let yourself go down . when you 're facing the match points , what are you thinking ? she gets nervous or that you have to play more aggressive ?
she had two unforced errors .
but the positive for you is that you 're managing to fight through these matches , and maybe your level will come in the next three ?
if things fall right , you could leave here as the world no.1 . you do n't sound like you think you 're ready for that .
in some way you must be pleased you were able to come back from two breaks down in the third set .
what did your coach say to you after the match ?
it 's almost like you have similarities to marat . there 's two different dinaras .
can you realize during the match you 're doing that ?
what is your strategy for tomorrow ?
your next game .
do you think maybe you 're being too hard on yourself and that 's the reason why you 're not playing the game you want to play ?
you feel like this match is much different than the one against maria and elena in paris , because you felt like you were playing better there ?
did you think back for a moment , when you were 5-2 down , to those matches ?
it seems like none of the top players are very confident in this tournament . maybe serena a little bit . jankovic lost .
and dementieva .
what are your feelings now ? disappointment ? despair ?
her shots are so hard to read , it would seem because they 're so flat .
how do you explain the slow start ?
do you think you 're paying for the fact that you did n't have the preparation you would have liked to have had ?
did you think this could happen to you because of the lack of preparation ?
when you made the sign of the cross in the second set ...
you 're likely to probably lose your no.1 ranking . is that at all a concern or not a priority ?
how hard is it for you to shake off a loss like this ? will you be thinking about it for days , weeks ?
it seems you did n't play your best tennis throughout the tournament .
has it been difficult to put sort of the questioning of your worth , of your no.1 ranking out of your mind ?
talking to you over the wall ?
the questioning of your no.1 ranking and your worth of that , has that been difficult to play in this environment ?
you might still stay no.1 depending on how the results fall . do you hope that 's the case , or is it easier to play not as the no.1 ?
what did your coach say to you ?
tactically what did your coach want you to do ? you mentioned opening up the court .
how does it feel to be in the quarterfinals ?
how do you think you found the energy to do it ?
do you have the capacity to come back for two sets ?
could you have imagined this when you were at your lowest ?
how is your ankle ?
was it strapped in advance , or was there a weakness there already ?
in terms of the tough matches in your career , physically , emotionally , where does this one rate ?
can you remember at 1-3 , love-30 in the third , can you remember what you felt or what you were thinking ?
when you rolled your ankle , did you think you would be able to go on ?
what 's it going to mean to you to represent australia in fed cup ?
will it mean more to you knowing that you 're getting some confidence back that you can mix it with some of the best players ?
when you say you 're feeling 20 % today , you mean as a result of the games you 've played now because you 're not at full fitness ?
you say it does n't matter . i 'm sure the competitor in you wants to grab a quarterfinal .
obviously between now and your match there will be sleep and food and recovery . how do you stay mentally fresh ?
a lot of positive emotions and it 's also been a pretty emotional week . how emotionally draining has that been for you ?
what about your coach ? has he come back to work yet ? he seems to have trouble controlling his emotions .
your dad said he might even make a surprise trip here . have you had any contact , or do you expect any ?
would you be open to it if he did come over ?
what you do you do tomorrow , jelena ?
how confident were you going into the match , given that you were head-to-head with her 3-all ?
any particular part of your game that pleased you ?
when did you realize she really was n't going to come back into the game ?
after your great run at wimbledon two years ago , were you satisfied with how you went in the grand slams last year ?
how determined were you in the off-season to come back and be a top-10 player again ?
was monica seles somebody you admired a lot ? you seem to have a very similar style .
australian season has n't been a happy hunting ground for you . now you made the final in brisbane and now in quarterfinals . do you sort of pinch yourself a little bit ?
do you feel in order to win matches against great players you have to be playing great on offense , or do you think defense now is a very important part of your game ?
winning against the world no.1 , does this mean for you you can go all the way up ? is this something that pops up in your mind after a match like this ?
do you feel like if you play your best the next three matches that you really do have a chance to win the tournament ?
how did the match go for you ?
it was a good score line for you .
was it easy , or what did you do to win ?
your next round , what are your thoughts on that ?
given your strong win today , does that give you confidence going into the match ?
could you give us your assessment of your game today .
could you give us an idea what you were thinking yesterday when that streaker came on court .
were you concerned with the amount of time he was on the court that it took security to do something about it ?
he was on for 30 , 45 seconds .
you breezed through the first set today , but second set was more of a struggle . outgrowth of her playing better , your maybe dropping your game a little bit , a little of both ?
would you say it was your forehand more that was maybe disappointing ?
when your sister loses , does that make you increase your motivation to win a tournament , to bring one home for the family , or does it not change things for you ?
falling behind in the second set , you never want to play badly , but once you 've had to fight back like that , is that a good experience for you to have had a bit of a tough battle going into the next round ?
how are you feeling compared to the other years you 've won here ?
did you head out to the practice courts again after this one , or you 're satisfied enough ?
your next opponent , mauresmo , you know her well . what do you know about azarenka ?
an up-and-comer , you 've been around . do you get any satisfaction out of sort of squashing them , putting them in their place ?
you 've been on the every-other-year plan here for some reason or another . is that happenstance , or do you feel it 's something how you approach this tournament every other year ?
what do you think about peng shuai 's performance today ?
you 've been a player who has been out of the game but been able to come back a few times in your career . what do you make of jelena dokic 's performance ?
can you talk about your millionaire password experience .
did it go faster than you anticipated ?
brandy , did you not see the n in there ? she gave the clue the bunch , like brady bunch ?
tennis is more your thing than password ?
you failed to put away the big points . is that a lack of match practice or you need more match practice ? lack of concentration ?
apparently one of the journalists said in a press conference before when you 're up 5-2 , you lost 15 of the next 17 points . what happened ? did she lift or did you go away ?
do you look at tonight as a case of opportunity lost ?
must be encouraging knowing you can compete with the top players at this stage .
you both had trouble on your service games tonight . was it the conditions or ...
do you think she can go all the way ?
where to now ?
what are your aims for the rest of the year ?
she described you as a top-20 player . what do you think you 've got to do to get in there ? anything technically or ...
it seemed like you gave yourself the best chance in that first set by mixing up the play a fair bit , moving her around a lot more than the second set . why the difference in the style of play ?
what ran through your head when you were sitting down at the end of the first set , you had your face in the towel ? close shot on the screen , and your head was down . what were you thinking about then ?
what kind of impressions did you have playing against the three-times singles champion here ?
impressions .
both of you had trouble holding serve . was that to do with the conditions ?
under the circumstances were you happy with your game at this stage ?
you 've played grand slams before against players who were in their own country and been okay . why the nerves ? you 've been in great form , have n't lost in a while .
she 's leading 5-2 in the first set and you then won 15 of the next 17 points . what did you do to effect that transformation ?
is it hard to keep winning , or once you get used to it , is it easier ? with each passing match , when you 're thinking , do you think that you 're due for a bad day ?
are you putting more pressure on yourself ? you 're playing at the top of your form . people are talking about you as a potential winner here . do you feel more pressure to succeed ?
what do you think about your next opponent , dominika cibulkova ?
is this your greatest chance at winning a grand slam now that you 're in such good form ?
looking at fed cup , obviously you have won it the last four or five years . besides for the depth amongst how many russian girls could possibly play , what makes the russians so tough ?
yes .
when you play a grand slam event in melbourne , do you stay in touch can tarpishchev on the phone ? does he give you any advice ?
is it a disappointment if there 's a particular tie and he does n't call you up ?
how much more deep and how many levels do you have in your own game compared to five years ago ? if you 're in a tough match , you can say to yourself that you can go higher and higher , depending on how your opponent is playing .
so it 's important for you not to try to be perfect because if you try to be perfect maybe you put so much pressure on yourself ?
first time into the fourth round here . you must be happy .
your success last year obviously gives you a lot more confidence . to take away a player like that in the third round probably is n't something you could have done last year .
do you feel you 're gradually improving each round ?
you said after your last match when you play passive you do n't play as well . is that because you 're getting more aggressive ?
you 're feeling fitter than you 've ever been . what was the turnaround with your fitness ?
are you proud of the performance of the russian girls generally ?
you say you 're focused on yourself now . will you watch marat tonight ?
are you tipping an upset tonight for marat against roger , a shock result ?
do you see marat a lot during this tournament ?
so you do n't stay in the same hotel ?
you stay in the comfort of your room tonight or come to watch ?
reaching a grand slam final , is the hardest thing the mental side of getting there , or is it the physical side of getting there ?
what 's the feeling after that win ?
was the key the start for you ?
you 're hitting the ball very hard out . is that the best you can stroke it ?
where did you learn to speak so well in english , and so fluently ?
and also , some other personal issues with about you . in the media guide there is not that much .
is your family rich , they could afford to send you everywhere ?
you mentioned italy . where were you in italy ?
how many languages do you speak ?
you got to be playing jelena dokic next .
did you beat her in practice ? did you play sets ?
did you grow up with some idols , russian tennis players ?
you 'll probably play on rod laver arena . jelena will have big crowd support .
what were your thoughts on the match today ? 6-4 . 6-4 scoreline .
she was getting some treatment during the match . does that put you off at all ?
you were taking off your shoes and just slipping with the heat , was it ?
so the air conditioners have n't arrived for your shoes yet ?
did n't seem to get your form where you wanted to in the third set .
how did you feel you 're playing in comparison to last year ?
you staged a remarkable comeback last year against . when you broke her back in the third set , did you think you were coming back again ?
she did play very well . were you happy with your own level throughout the match ?
so how disappointing is this for you , or is it just another maybe roadblock ?
are you surprised that after winning roland garros things have gotten more difficult ?
have you got anyone in your entourage that 's been in a situation like this ? you 're not working with a coach , are you ?
you looked a bit nervous out there .
do you have any comments on the violence that happened today outside , and your thoughts on fans getting so upset they feel like they have to punch each other ?
would you say that 's the biggest win of your career to date ?
you said in your on-court interview that by losing the first set it was a favor to you . what do you mean by that ?
when you 're able to play that well against someone who 's 11 in the world , what do you think that tells you about where you are in your redevelopment as a player ?
you seem to be more in charge of your emotions now , more comfortable with where you 're at . is it starting to sink in ? are you starting to become a believer in yourself and what you can do ?
you had a lot of build up to it and you 've done a lot of work . now that you 're actually out on court and beating some of the top girls . what 's that done for your confidence ?
when was the last time you felt such a buzz on a tennis court that you obviously , by your reactions , both during and after the game , felt tonight ?
just the sense of excitement of being out there and the emotions of being in ...
do you think it 's to your advantage that these girls have n't played you before and do n't know what to expect ?
are you surprised a little by yourself ?
you were almost a little bit embarrassed when you apologized out there . do you feel like you want to give a little bit back ?
do you feel as if the country has forgiven you ?
you talk about looking forward to the rest of the year . you 're in the last 16 here . when can you start to dream anything is possible next week ?
for the rest of this week though , do you let yourself dream you can go all the way ?
just give us a slight insight into - your coach and your boyfriend were going delirious at the end - as to how that started and how you hope it will carry on in the future .
how did you actually get together with your coach ?
you seem more and more calm as the rounds go on . is there reason for that , or just getting used to what 's going on around you ?
thoughts on that game ?
is there anything to work on ?
a bit more mental energy than physical today ?
how did you find the conditions ?
any sign of the cramps ?
first time we 've had two women in the third round . seems to be a lot of hype around you and jelena . can you put your finger on why that is ?
confident going a bit further ?
is there more pressure on her ?
what is the process you go through with david ? look at recent tapes or , you know , from having watched her ?
what makes elena so hard to beat ? great groundstrokes ?
after the last match , you were up 5-1 , went off the board a bit , you could n't put your finger on it . did you do anything between your first round and today to try to get that out of your mind or deal with that better ?

how distracting were the conditions ? pretty tough , was it ?
still feel the hunger for more appearances here now that you 've had four matches ?
there 's obviously been a lot of hype about the aussie youngsters in the men 's singles . there 's been some good results for the women , as well , for australian players . how do you think the young women players are coming through ? are you excited about it ? could we see a future grand slam champion ?
that seemed to be better than your first one . what was your assessment of your form ?

do you feel like anything has changed since sydney ?
what happened in that first set ?
so you 're not concerned about your form ?
what about your second serve ? you only won 27 % of points today . are you concerned about that area of your game ?
given the conditions are different today , did it make any difference to the way the ball played ?
you had some frustrations in sydney , too . did you come to melbourne thinking it would be a bit easier down here , or do you still feel a bit frustrated with your game ?
you always emphasize playing aggressively . have you ever had matches where you feel maybe you played too aggressively , went for too much ?
when did this idea come to you ? was it berlin where it sort of clicked ?
you put so much passion into your tennis . what do you do away when you leave the courts to relax ?
do you feel you 're missing out on a lot by not sight-seeing ?
it 's not a grand slam thing ? if you 're at indian wells or miami , you do n't go out for a cocktail or to the beach ?

what 's the best piece of advice he 's given you ?
an atp event is coming to your country . do you hope you get a wta tour event , too ?

what happened with your calf , was it ?
could you have gone again ? was there more ?
did you enjoy it out there ?
bernard has to do it tomorrow night .
what do you think cause that slump for yourself late in the first set ?

what do you think you have to work on perhaps for the next round ? is it a matter of being physically fit and mentally attuned ?
four women who have been extremely prominent in tennis in recent years - kim clijsters , justine henin , maria sharapova and lindsay davenport - are not in this event . do you think that creates a greater opportunity for you ?
you must have been happy with that game first up .
did you feel the benefits of your rigorous training schedule in the off-season today ? did you feel fitter on court ?
what can you tell me about kirsten flipkens , your next opponent ?

are you waiting for that moment where you 're going to wake up in the morning , get on the court , everything is going to be great again ?
how much tougher do you think this slam is than the other three , being that with those three you 're playing already into the year , and here basically everybody is coming in ?
what about the speed of the courts ? are they any faster or slower than last year ?
what would satisfy you at this tournament ? how could you walk away a happy person , be happy with your game ?
how much does playing well , playing your best , mean to you ?
how do you rate your own chances at the moment ? how do you rate your own game or form right now ?

can i ask you something about the mental game . looks like you 've made the biggest improvement in this part of the tennis . what continues the most in this improvement , that you are different player than was before ?
both of you played an aggressive baseline strategy . in the first set , you had four winners to twenty unforced errors and she had four to nineteen . do you assume that that is part of your strategy , that you just do n't look at that aspect of the statistics and just go out and continue to hit ?

last season was a big season with russia , fed cup and olympics . can you talk about what it means to play for your country ?
dinara was saying yesterday she feels it 's extremely difficult , if not impossible , to have real friends on the tour or other players . do you feel that way ?
she also spoke about how it was so difficult growing up , that she did n't have a normal childhood . then by the time she gets to her 30s , she 'll sort of have to learn so much . do you feel that your childhood just was n't there ? that you missed out on a lot of things ?

on a physical level , you 're stronger maybe than ever . how do you work hard if the tournament is so close ? what do you do in the gym ? how do you keep the regimen going on ?
you 've come so close to winning two grand slam titles recently . what do you think it would take to give you that next little bit of an edge so that you can finally win one ?
what would you do differently the next chance , aside from winning ?
what lessons have you learned from your brother 's experiences ?
well , on that note , you know , you are slowly but surely becoming more famous than him . more in the spotlight . do you tease him about this ? is there any little game about that ?
when you go through a press conference like this and your brother is not brought up , no one talks about him at all , do go back to the locker room and celebrate ?
do you feel like more pressure as the no.1 seed ? does it affect you at all ?
how are you influenced by the crowd ? if the crowd is cheering for you , does that help you ?
do you wish venus and serena were here ?
have you been paying attention to the tournament and seen all the girls who have lost ?
do you socialize with venus and serena and the other top players ?
first of all , how is your ankle ?
but were you struggling with it ?
can you talk about that friday night ? it was really late , but you were serving for the match and then you get hurt . take us back to how you got hurt .
but at any point did you think might have to retire from the match ?
and then you said it was hurting a lot yesterday . were you putting a lot of weight on it ? how bad was to yesterday ?
and how was it today when you were out there ? how much pain were you still going through ?
this must be a nice run for you . you beat a top 10 player , a top 5 player to get to the fourth round .
can you talk about that crazy let call you got at 4-2 in the second set when the umpire called let ?
did she explain to you why she called the let , which did n't seem like there was a reason ? and then why she would n't take it back ?
yeah .
do you normally get so emotional ? you were angry throughout the set until the end when you won . do you normally get so emotional and angry ?
you gave your racquet a very good workout on the court .
but you 're able to get angry and then get focused again ?
so you 've always had problems with your temper , with the anger ?
so why do you think you 've been playing so well at this tournament ?
you must know wozniacki pretty well , huh ?
so you 're ready for the big revenge this time ?
how long have you been friends with caroline ?
what was it like to beat your sister a couple weeks ago ?
the williams sisters are asked how it is when they play each other . how is it for you emotionally when you play her ?
are your personalities similar or are you very different ?
when you 're together at a tournament , do you spend a lot of time together or do you hang out separately ?
do you get sick of each other ?
never ?
what did you fight about ?
pretty good run you 're putting together there , jill . what do you attribute it to ?
so what 's the couple of things you 've been experimenting with ?
they 're state secrets ?
but it 's on court , i 'm assuming .
you say it 's just starting to come together , but obviously each day that goes by it 's got to be a little easier or a little more ingrained in you , is n't it ?
so why has it changed week , jill ? because the year has n't gone particularly that great for you .
more than what ? shot selection and what you 're doing with the ball or what ...
i notice you 've got an ice pack . is your wrist hurting ?
how does it feel when you go out there ? almost every round , except when you were playing date you were the older player .
so have you lost any speed at all , you think ? usually by your 30s at some point you lose a little bit . have you felt that ?
does experience really matter for you ?
how would you describe the difference between earlier in your career where , well , there 's a lot more english in the locker room , a lot more american players , and now they 're far and few between .
so how long are you going to play ?
are you year to year now ?
what were your thoughts last year going into the off-season about how long you wanted to play ?
have there been times in your career where you felt you 've had too much tennis ?
with all this travel , you 've been so many different places , unusual places . what would be like the most unusual , offbeat , bizarre incident that 's happened in all your travels ?
is your win over serena at wimbledon , is that your career highlight , or is it something else ?
memories of that match ?
you see a lot of the young american players . who comes to mind first ? i know some of them are probably your friends , but if you 're thinking of one or two you feel are really talented and can make a big move . women , i mean .
yeah .
do you think the williams sisters have set the bar too high for american women 's tennis ?
but what i mean is that the expectation from a lot of american fans is that american women should be winning slams or getting close to it rather than , you know , playing to the third or fourth round ?
but would n't you say it 's more a situation of reality than hype or misunderstanding ? aside from venus and serena , there really are not even a small number of americans who are really challenging deep into big tournaments or majors .
are you still coached by raj ?
did n't he go to music school ? am i wrong about that ?
and then what happened ?
he did n't just miss coaching you full time ?
the toughest stroke you 've ever faced ?
like serena 's serve or someone 's forehand ?
welcome back .
can you kind of talk about that match ? it just seemed like a lot of ebbs and flows to that match .
can you talk about that the 6-5 game ? she had the two break points . can you talk about what was going through your mind ?
in the tiebreaker , seemed like you started to just take control .
what 's different with her from the other two times you 've played her ? i know you 've beaten her in straight sets the last two times , but not easy straight sets .
looks like they 've been keeping you pretty busy here at the tournament with autograph signings and the unveiling of the trophy . can you talk about the demands on your time ?
you 've won this tournament twice before , in '02 and '07 . what is it about the desert that brings out your best tennis ?
what have the demands on your time been like since sports illustrated ? obviously that 's a very high profile thing to be in . has that changed your life a lot or at all ?
when you talk about your career outside the court . obviously you 've modeled in a few magazines . you know , what kind of boundaries do you have to have when you model so it does n't interfere with your tennis ?
you know , a couple years ago when anna was on the tour , she got a lot of attention , some of it good , some of it bad . do you ever kind of look at her career and then like just apply those to your experiences ?
is that a hard thing to resist ? because obviously , you know , you go for five days . i 'm sure you made quite a bit of money , more than a lot of tournaments . is that kind of tough ?
can you talk about the next round ? i forgot who you 're playing next .
did you have a chance to watch much of that match today ?
have you played against her before ?
anything that you saw of her game that might concern you or depress you ?
i heard you like to call home to talk to your dogs . what do you say to them ?
on a day like today , it 's a hard day . what positive can you take away that you can apply to the next tournament , next match ? do you learn something on a day like today that you can think about next time ?
what 's your most important advice for young tennis players ?
your serve years ago was much slower . you 've made some changes . how much better are you now as a server than you were three years ago ?
today was just an off day ? was there any particular problem or reason ?
is it just fatigue ? there 's no injury or anything like that ?
did the heat factor in at all ? was the weather any sort of ...
you go straight to miami now or what do you do now ?
this has obviously got to be a huge win .
what was the key to the match for you ?
did you have a special game plan coming in ?
how did you maintain your composure ? you were up 3-0 in the first set and she was up 4-3. then you lost the second set . you managed to maintain your composure . did you have to kind of talk to yourself ?
is this the biggest win of your career ?
did you have to change anything during the match or like in the third set ? did you change tactics at all ?
have you been playing particularly well as of late , or did you just find some great form during qualifying and coming into this match ?
so it 's just once ? nothing particularly good has been happening this year for you ?
did you always know that you were capable of beating a player as good as she is ?
are you going to keep this strategy that you played today for your next match ?
what 's your routine like here at the tournament ?
when you 're going week to week on the tour and not winning matches that much , do you say to yourself , yes , at some point i 'm going to be on a big , big stadium and i 'm going to play an olympic gold medalist and i 'm going to win a match like that ?
so when you walked off the court today you said , i 'm so happy ; it finally happened to me ?
you live in paris , france ?
why did you decide to that ?
is he still your boyfriend ?
does it fit your personality , paris , better than czech republic does ?
after your tough battles all week that , was a bit easy , was n't it ?
svetlana made a lot of unforced errors , but were you also playing better at the start ?
earlier in the week you said you were sometimes frustrated about yourself and you do n't know what was wrong with your brain at times . do you feel better about that situation now ?
the french open starts in a month . you had final last week ; a win this week . how confident do you feel going into that ?
do you think it 's tougher , the semifinal or the final ?
was that actually playing in your mind a bit , that you had a lot three finals already ?
were you able to handle the pressure better today compared to last week ? was that a factor or no ?
if someone asks you if your like better your forehand or backhand , where do you feel more confident ?
you are the first russian to win the title here . does that mean anything for you , or nothing at all ?
you 've not been no.1 for so long , but have you noticed since you 've been no.1 that maybe players are lifting their game a bit against and so they 're playing a little bit better than they would have done otherwise ?
( through translation . ) how do you explain this defeat , given that you had arrived in the final with some great matches ?
you won last sunday versus dinara . what was the difference between sunday and today ?
is it worrying when you know what 's going wrong but you ca n't do anything about it ?
even so , on the whole are you pleased with how the tournament went ? until the final you looked to be the most in-form player .
do you think you were just beaten by the better person on the day and it was just one of those things , or is there something you think you should have done during the match ?
she said at the end of the match that she was the one that was going for the shots and that you were more passive . do you think you could have attacked more at the end ?
how much was important you did n't finish the first set when you were leading 5-2 ?
maybe it was too long for you ? you lose some energy ?
did you feel tired at the end ? the third set was also a physical tiredness ?
once you 've gone past three hours in a match , what are you thinking at that point ?
so you were just enjoying it ?
in the first set , as well as playing very good tennis , you seemed to be out-thinking her a little bit . that obviously did n't happen so much during the rest of the game . why do you think that was ?
just to see the positive side of the week , you 're back in no.3 position , which , i mean you was n't there anymore since six years almost . does it mean anything to you ? even if you were no.1 , maybe you do n't care .
behind your sister , so you 're not that far .
anyway , it means that you 're quite close to the top again . you 're not that far .
the trophy that you have n't won yet is roland garros . after how you performed here this week , how do you rate your chances there ?
as it 's a tournament you 've never won , how do you fancy your chances ?
pretty much . i was trying to reword it and see if i could get a better answer .
if i reword it a third time , will i get a better answer ?
i am , too . i do a bit of salsa .
after this match you can say that dinara is a good no.1 in the world ? is better than you thought ? maybe she improved so much ? what did you think about ?
were you a bit disappointed that the attendance was n't that great in this women 's tournament , apart from today ? what do you think ? do you think the italians do n't like enough women 's tennis , or other reasons ? the combined event would be better ?
congratulations on winning such an epic match . how did you manage to overcome the nerves that you had on wednesday and thursday in your previous matches ?
is the match hardest mentally or physically ?
( through translation . ) so you think you deserve the no.1 ranking ?
do you think you won that match on determination more than anything else at the end ?
that 's more than ten hours on court the last three days . do you have any energy left for tomorrow ?
how is your ankle ?
were you thinking about it at all when you were playing ?
do you consider this your best match on clay court this year , or ever ?
you can say this is the hardest spot in all your career , or not ?
is there an extra satisfaction when you beat one of the williams sisters because they have so many titles between them ?
will you think about the last match against kuznetsova tomorrow ?
you lost last week to svetlana . what would you try to do different this time ?
what 's happen ? what 's happening second set , 2-0 , breakpoint ?
you seemed to be frustrated at the umpire 's call . how much does that distract you afterwards , and how important was that ?
you 've reached the semis here . how do you assess your overall clay court preparation ahead of the french ?
you had a comfortable win today . how do you assess your performance , also comparing to previous matches which were longer and tougher ?
the problem was the clay ? it was to move well on clay ? it was light ? or it was because it was cold ? which was it ?
yesterday .
the mistake was how you was moving ?
but the biggest mistake was ?
how much is difficult to do n't be too much upset about yourself when you 're not able to play good ?
now you can feel very confident for tomorrow ?
did you see dinara before ?
she did not play so well the beginning of the match .
in the past you beat her in two matches , but on another surface . do you think tomorrow will change anything on the clay ?
what of those elements that you were talking about earlier , being aggressive and also patient , going into a match with a player like safina , will you go in playing very aggressively ? will be you patient at first ?
you and kuznetsova maybe have the same attitude . does not depends about your opponent , depends most of what is in your mind , if you are in the right mood or not . do you an agree that kuznetsova is the biggest opponent you can have in general after serena ?
how did you assess your clay court preparation at this point ? are you at the point where you want it to be ?
what do you at 11:00 in the night now in rome ?
( through translation . ) was it difficult to beat her ?
( through translation . ) if tomorrow goes well for you , you could even reach the final on saturday . i noticed that in the past three finals you lost , so do you feel ready now for a new final ? do you think you could go all the way this time ?
she seemed to be giving you a lot of problems with the variety of her match . she did a lot of different things with slices , dropshots , serve and volleying . can you explain how a match can change so dramatically from 3-1 to her and breakpoints in the second set to you running away with it ?
what was the difference on your serve , as well ? you lost four of the first seven service games , and then i think it was ten or twelve double faults . after that you seemed to be fine on your serve .
( through translation . ) what 's your opinion about the current situation of women 's tennis in the world ? since the 20th of april you 've been no.1 . there 's been alternating no.1s . do you think you can now stay for a long time ?
you called for the trainer during the second set . what was the problem with your foot ?
so it was your ankle not your foot ?
the last two days you 've spent more than seven hours on the court . does n't it kind of beg the question , why are you playing the doubles ? is n't that a bit too much ? do you not risk getting bit to too tired ?
( through translation . ) when you win , do you also find it important to get your brother 's approval ? do you kind of , in away , do it for his approval , or for yourself ?
do you have arguments as to who is better ?
so he wins the argument .
( through translation . ) many people say you are the female version of nadal . what do you think of that ?
( through translation . ) many people say you often lack consistency . do you feel that way ?
( through translation . ) do you think you have a chance of winning the tournament ?
( through translation . ) you do n't speak italian but you understand it . why is that ?
in your words , what happened out there ? was she just playing too well ?
in your words , in your mind , what happened out there ? was she just playing too well ?
in terms of build-up for the french open , how has this week gone for you , and what do you still need to do to be ready ?
where do you go from here now before the french ?
what did you buy yesterday ?
did you expect your opponent to adopt a tactic like she did on the court with so many moon balls ?
there were a lot breaks to the serve . i mean , how do you explain ? it is normal for you to be broken so many times and to break the others , or not ?
psychological ?
you felt a little bit nervous in the court ? it was maybe you were making many more mistakes than usual probably , much more than yesterday . was it maybe because you were not ready to face all these moon balls ? what was the reason ?
is it more difficult to come from belarus than from russia for a player who wants to become a professional , or not ? are you helped the same way ? you let 's have the kind of help from the federation somewhat , or have to do all by yourself ?
so there is not any advantage to be russian than belarusian ?
do you have any idol in belarus , like mirnyi or someone else before him , or not ? any inspiration ?
you are the player who made the biggest improvements this year in terms of rankings , and maybe in terms of level of play . which are your goals in terms of this season ?
the way you talk , you speak very good english . were you raised and stayed a long time in america ?
which is , in your opinion , the shot you must improve most ?
which is maybe your favorite shot , the one you are happy to hit ?
how popular are you in your country ? you 're a star there ? they recognize and stop you in the street , or not yet ?
do they go also in personal and start talking about your family and things like that , what your parents were doing or things like that , or just concentrated on you ?
how old is he ?
can you tell the name ?
like mirnyi ?
who is the most popular athlete in belarus ?
well done on getting through .
did you come off court thinking to yourself , i did really well and battled through from 5-2 down , or were you thinking , how on earth did i get into that position in the first place ?
for someone who is the world no.1 and has just won a tennis match , you look quite down . can you explain why that is ? is it because you set yourself higher standards than that ?
have you been able to understand why that is ?
aside from your displaying a great fighting spirit , was there anything positive to draw on from the way you played today ?
do you wonder with you being this upset what the other players in the world feel , that they 're all worse than you because you 're the best at the moment ?
are you glad of the rest , or would you have rather stayed on court for another half an hour , three-quarters of an hour ?
now you go to training , or not ?
what 's better for you in a tournament like this : a tough match like yesterday or an easy one like today ?
would you have preferred to spend a bit longer on court today ?
will you look for anything special in your shopping later , or not ?
other than the cold you just mentioned , how are you in terms of fitness at the moment ? during the clay court season least year you seemed to pick up a lot of little niggles by the time you got it roland garros ?
do you prefer for tomorrow a revenge against pennetta or svetlana ?
how much energy do you use shopping ?
for shopping , do you listen opinion of your mother , for example , or friends ?
returning to today 's match , while the match was played you looked in very good form . was that in any way a reaction to being a little bit frustrated yesterday at a few too many unforced errors ?
you seemed to be hitting the ball in the right spots , but just not hard enough .
so is that confidence if you 're standing further back and not attacking the ball ?
did you suffer from the change in the game conditions comparing from yesterday even ? yesterday the court was probably much slower than today .
how do you feel about your general clay court form so soon before roland garros where you 're defending your title ?
how do you explain the difference between the early part of the game , the middle , and the end ? was it just your opponent 's play , or was there something that changed in your play ?
did you suffer from a problem on your foot , or not ?
you have many , many fan in the girl , not just the man . how do you explain the success ? i know many , many girl come from many , many kilometers to see you today . how do you explain the success ?
can you tell us what it was like to have to wait around all day long not really knowing what time you would come on , when you would start ? how do you keep yourself motivated ?
would that explain why you had so much more trouble in the first set than the second ?
did you hurt yourself when you fell over in the seventh game ?
what do you think compared to last year , the calendar has been changed and the tournament ends on saturday here in rome , so you do n't have an extra day to manage rain and something like this ? so it 's more pressure also for the organizers .
can you explain what it was that was dangerous about the court ? was it the court itself , or was it the weather ?
in the men 's circuit , federer , nadal , even djokovic tried to help with the organization , they were talking about the calendar , and they are part , in a way , of the board . what about the women ? do you have any word ? i mean , do you control a little bit the situation , or you are completely out ? and who should do it , in your opinion ?
speaking about game conditions and the different tournaments , what do you think about the fact of this year you have madrid , which is played at 700 meters high ? the conditions will be dramatically different from roland garros , which is mainly the ultimate goal of the clay season .
i remember i saw you playing when you were 16 in florence in a junior tournament , and you were always with italian girls talking . how is your italian ? because you speak spanish fluently , so do you understand everything what she says when she 's translating , or not ?
in general .
do you remember the first time you came in italy , how old you were and which tournament you played ?
the rain was problem for you , or not ?
you were up 6-3 , 4-2. what happened at that point ? did something distract you ?
rome brought you quite a lot of luck in the past years . you started again with your new career after few defeats a few years ago , and then two wins . to be here now , you feel fine ? you feel confident also ? or some defeats you had and the problems you had because of your mother left you a little uncertain , unsure ?
what are the things in your game that you will work on looking ahead for the next match ? was there anything specific aspects that you were unhappy with ?
djokovic has his own tournament in belgrade . are you hoping to do the same one day for the women 's ?
did you have a sports complex with 20,000 seats ?
playing japan , so can you imagine ...
maybe you should create a company with ana and create a tournament there .
you happy with the way you started the tournament ?
you started very , very , very well , and then you encountered problems in the second set . what do you put that down to ?
you said you were happy about the amount of balls you hit . do you think it 's good in a way to start off with a tough match to sort of get you into the groove ? you 've sort of not played the first round and gone straight into the second round .
so in that sense , you do n't think it was good preparation in the fact that she was n't a typical sort of player you 're going to have on clay ?
because she 's an unusual sort of player to be facing on clay with the short rallies , whereas you usually expect players to be more patient on clay .
what did your coach say to you at halftime ? what did your coach say to you between those two sets ?
she 's very difficult when she defends well , is n't she ?
you had some entertaining exchanges with your coach today .
like firey , maybe . you had some interesting exchanges . you apologized afterwards for not listening .
was there a reason ? were you thinking about something else ? were you trying too hard to put it together ? was there a reason you went so hot and cold there ?
the grand slams you ca n't use the coach , can you ?
she says that you 're the best player on the tour regardless of your loss . do you feel like she might be the best player on tour ?
does a result like tonight dent your confidence at all going into the australian open , or do you just take the positives out of the week ?
through the year you 've had the french open final and the titles that you won , is there real excitement to get to melbourne this year ?
with the form that you 've had with the four titles last season and reaching your first grand slam final , do you feel this makes you a lot more confidence , and will it be more satisfying for you this time ?
is this the best shape , conditioning you 've ever been coming into a year ?
a few hiccups in the second set , but a perfect start to the year otherwise ?
when you were sitting down to christmas dinner , did you think in your wildest dreams you would win back-to-back titles at the beginning of the season ?
so there 's nothing that you did that you can think of in your preparation that just snapped ?
seems like you 're much more calm and composed . in the in the late stages of the match , do you really know , this is what i have to do , and i can actually do it during the match ?
do you think there 's now maybe in a way a little bit more pressure on you that you had such a good run into the australian open and obviously grand slam victories have eluded you so far ?
why would you call her the best player on tour when you beaten her three times before ?
it 's open for you , too . you have no.1 as a possibility for you . your first grand slam . your level is very high . would n't you put yourself right up there with her ?
you said many times in your career your dream is to be no.1 , and , of course , win a grand slam . seems like now you 're really pretty close .
is the belief there ?
was there a bit of fatigue after the late night last nate .
how did you find the heat ?
how would you sum up your preparation in sydney this week for the australian open ?
how does your body feel ? your ankles were troubling you last night , and you came in with concerns about your hamstring .
what was going through your head there in that second set ? she sort of just took it away from you ?
do you think you 'll be able to do better next week ?
elena has been around for a while but has n't won a grand slam . what does she have to do to take the next step ?
do you feel like she 's improved in the last six or seven months as a player , or is she still where she 's always been ?
who do you think might win out of those two , safina or dementieva ?
when will you fly to melbourne ? tomorrow ? tonight ? practice with venus ? what will your plans be ?
who is the favorite for the aussie open ?
and in the women 's ?
do you think jelena jankovic really is no.1 ? in your mind , is she the best player in the world ?
in the world .
given your sequence of wins in the australian open , the odd years , is this your year again ?
do you think that 's part of the reason why you 've won some tournaments , and even grand slams in difficult or unlucky positions , because of your confidence ?
she thinks your better than her as well ?
there anything that does dent your confidence , reduce your confidence ?
so how hot did it feel out there today ?
i noticed you seemed pretty determined to try and wrap it up in the second set . is that because you did n't want to play another set in that heat ?
how does it affect you on the court , the heat ? do you find that you do n't have a lot of energy ?
you did n't have any problem with the freshness after yesterday 's game or anything like that ? obviously ai had a day off yesterday , so she was coming in pretty fresh .
did you see serena 's match last night ?
she saved three match points . they mentioned last night that she 's won eight matches where she 's come match point down . is she the toughest player on the tour to beat ?
does serena have something different from the others ?
do you care which player you play in the final ?
this is your most successful trip to australia already i think , yes ?
does it give you a lot of confidence for next week that you 've made the final here ?
i mean , that 's a characteristic of the very best players , is that they can win when they 're not playing their best .
yes ?
were you able to do that last year , do you think ?
are you feeling mentally better prepared going into this australian open than you have in the past ?
so you mental approach is better now in dealing with these close situations ?
how do you like having your coach come on court during matches ? do you like this new thing ?
you have n't had him on the court every match , have you ?
you have ?
what did he say to you today ?
because you were stepping back a little bit ?
obviously you do n't know who your opponent is going to be , but how did you see your game matching up with both of those girls ?
so you do n't reckon you 'll change your game depending on who you 're playing ?
you were quite unhappy after the match yesterday . do you feel like you improved today ?
how are you feeling physically after two pretty tough days out in the heat ? feeling all right ?
and what will you do to recover from the match ? will you have any ice bath , or ...
you 've now set up an all-russian final . you played safina in the beijing final . are you looking forward to it it ?
when you beat someone like serena williams you 're going to be one of the favorites in the australian open . are you prepared for all that ?
you 've beaten serena , i think , the last three times you 've played her now . have you worked her out ? is there something you 're doing now that you were n't before ?
have you sort of done anything different in the past sort of six or seven months with your game ? you 're now obviously getting into and winning finals . do you feel like you 're playing any differently , or have you done anything differently ?
was the olympic final the turning point for your career ?
when serena was in here earlier , she said even if she was ranked 1000 in the world she would still believe she was the best player in the world . her confidence is not affected very much by how good she plays . did you struggle with your confidence earlier in your career ? is it something you 've had to work on ?
so that final last year in dubai was the one that told you , yes , i deserve to be here in the top 5 or something ?
you 've had two weeks of full tennis with auckland and here , but you 're looking really fresh . are you feeling fresh ?
i think you had a heat problem here one other time that you played .
do you cope better with it now , do you think ?
right . but it was probably as hot out there today .
so do you think you 're a bit tougher now than in 2005 as a player ?
now you 're playing dinara tomorrow . looking back to last year , two matches you played against her : the one at french and the olympics . are they the worst and the best memories of last season ?
what 's the key for you to beating her tomorrow , what part of your game ?
you mentioned you got on court second and the edge was sort of taken out of the heat . you did have a quicker game than dinara . do you think that might give you a slight edge on tomorrow ?
you had the luck of the irish and no irish bones in you .
how do you prepare for that kind of match ? i know you watched her a little bit .
as experienced as you are , did you have to tell yourself , look , just keep playing and something might go right for me ? i mean , it was getting very tight out there on a couple occasions .
is this the perfect sort of preparation for the australian open , i mean , two really tough matches like that ?
quick turnaround tomorrow . early afternoon start .
after a match like that do you need a rubdown tonight or tomorrow , a massage ?
you look really composed in those pressure situations . are you actually composed on the inside ?
and with your ankles , did you roll them tonight ?
when you broke your string in the first set tiebreak , did you think that might be a sign of the night ?
we can see you 're still sweating . describe the conditions and how hard it was to concentrate .
so close to a grand slam , is it a problem because you expect this heat in melbourne but getting it earlier here drains you a bit ?
must be very pleased with the way you 're playing .
up until today . you played a lot of good matches last week .
how did you see this match in isolation to the other matches you 've played ?
the australian open , probably more than the other grand slams because of the time of the year and the weather conditions here , has always been a little bit of a sort of survival of the fittest . how did you prepare , train yourself in the off-season , and did you do anything differently to other years ?
how are you going to turn it around before melbourne ?
is it a matter of how much you 've improved that you 're so disappointed with a match that you actually won ?
do you find the australian open , because of the physical conditions , the hardest to prepare and play in ?
you had long matches this week . was it just too much tennis the beginning of the season , body reacting ?
so you 've got a few days to get it right before melbourne ?
that should n't be a problem .
what happens now rehabilitation-wise between now and melbourne ? is it stretching ? what sort of things do you have to do ?
can you ask for a late start in the singles ?
are you playing doubles in melbourne ?
is it the first time this kind of injury happens ?
so you were playing the final in paris , it could be in the final melbourne as well .
when will you decide if you 're playing melbourne ?
how do you feel inside ?
are you disappointed to get an injury so close to a grand slam ?
is part of the thinking perhaps that sort of playing sugiyama she can keep you out there for a long time ?
boring today ?
comfortable match today ?
seemed like you were trying to get off the court as quick as possible . how did you find the heat ?
what part of your game were you happiest with ?
between games you seem to be referring to a piece of paper . can you tell us anything about that ?
can you tell us anything about them ?
how regularly do those things change ?
obviously you 're coming up against wozniacki in the quarterfinals . what do you make of her ?
is your mom here now ?
nice to have the support of family ?
what 's sort of things has she said to you since you arrived ?
what was it in this case ?
you had a bit of a tough start . what was happening with that ?
right .
you felt you played better in the second set .
are you happy with your preparation going into melbourne now that you 've had brisbane and sydney ?
did you consult the trainer at the end of the first set ?
could you feel a difference between elena 's level and azarenka 's level ?
what did you find most difficult about dementieva today ?
how hot did you find it out there ?
sam 's wildcard is a cause for celebration ?
looking forward to getting back under the australian flag ?
have you and sam played mixed before ?
what round was that ?
how are you guys playing tennis together on the court ?
does n't create any extra tension off the court ?
are going to take sam 's surname when you get married ?
how was your first match ?
i guess it 's almost sort of the perfect start , is n't it , that kind of a match .
what have you done in the off-season ?
you made such a great improvement last year . at the end of year , did you sort of assess what you 've done that year and what you need to make that step into the top 10 ?
so what have you worked on ? what do you feel you 've improved on in the off-season ?
have you set yourself any goals for this week , or is it just a matter of getting as much court time as possible ?
what about a goal for the year having made such a big improvement last year ?
do you feel that in some ways the year after you 've had such a good year it 's more difficult because people are learning how to play you ?
did you take a holiday as a reward at the end of the year ?
i think your best result in grand slams is fourth round .
is it one of your goals to get further than that sometime this year ?
and do you feel like the surface for the australian open suits your game ?
have you undergone any special preparation for the australian summer of tennis ?
so you already feel you 're better prepared this year than you have been previously for melbourne ?
so very comfortable start to the tournament for you .
you said you wanted to be more aggressive , so therefore was it a good matchup to get you into that ?
same tactic for you tomorrow . going to try to keep this going through the tournament ?
some the other players coming from hopman cup have found it difficult to adjust from indoors to outdoors . did you find that today ?
i guess it 's been a pretty solid warm up-to the australian open for you . what sort of do you do for the next week or so going into the tournament ?
so are you happy to have a busier preparation going into a grand slam ?
so you how was your match ?
it 's always tough getting up for a tournament immediately after you 've won .
is it more of a mental battle when you have to go through this ?
there have been quite a few withdrawals from the tournament today with various injuries and ailments . are you concerned that you 're going to have too many matches ?
what went wrong for you out there today ?
yeah .
did you struggle to adjust from indoors to outdoors coming from hopman cup ?
just before the australian open last year , how did you sort of feel going into that tournament , and can you compare the feeling now to that ?
how do you go about doing that in the space of a week ?
is it just a matter of the trying too much ?
was there any one particular thing in today 's game , or just did nothing sort of work for you ?
you get a win in the hopman cup . did that sort of make you feel perhaps things were starting to come right and start play better tennis ?
going into the game today , did you sort of have a feeling you might not be quite right ?
is there someone that you go to for advice in that situation , whether it be a sports psychologist or a past player ?
do you think the doubles matches might help in a less-pressure atmosphere to rediscover the fun of being out there on the tennis court without sort of worrying too much ?
finding your mindset .
tell us about the shoulder . is there a problem ?
you had a great season last year . great win here today . how are you feeling ?
cibulkova said she had a bit of trouble adjusting to the outdoor conditions after perth . did n't seem to be a problem for you .
so you 've made such a big progress last year . what goals have you set for yourself for this year ?
so you want to be an all-court player ?
there are a lot of good net players in france .
traditionally in men .
with your shoulder at the moment and with the australian open very close by , does that make you hesitant to keep pushing through this tournament if it does get worse ?
is it something that can be managed with physiotherapy , or do you need an operation at some point ?
tendonitis ?
so at the moment it 's inflamed but there 's no tear ?
you had such a great tournament last week in perth . how did you feel coming into sydney and the different circumstances . was that a big change for you ?
what did you feel she did particularly well today ?
how will focus on your preparation for the australian open ?
is there any particular shot that you will focus on ?
are you planning to team up with dominik hrbaty again ?
if i 'm not wrong , i think you 've had more top 10 wins last year than jankovic . in that context , what sort of goals have you set for 2009 ?
what did you do for fun in the pre-season ?
two weeks . where did you go ?
maldives ?
was it in bratislava ?
amelie , you ca n't hide anymore . you 've defeated three top 10 players this week . so can we say that you 're back to the top ?
amelie , it 's been thrilling to watch you play all week . have you been surprised at all by how quite well you 've played ?
how much do you enjoy playing in front of this crowd ?
i 'm wondering , get some reaction from you on the uaa 's refusal to grant a visa to shapira to go to the dubai open , do you have any thoughts on that , not been given any visa allowing her to come into the country , any reaction to that at all ?
you played a three-set match yesterday against jankovic ; did you feel any fatigue during the match today against dementieva ?
it was obviously a very long and tight match . do you feel that you 've missed your chances in the first set , and that could have been a different story if you had won the first set ?
amelie has been reluctant to answer this question , but since you 've played her , do you feel she 's come back to her best level ?
how were you feeling physically in the third set , because you played a lot at the start of the season while you were still fresh or a little bit of time ?
do you think that not playing your semifinal yesterday had an impact on your performance today ?
how difficult is it to pick yourself up for dubai , the tournament started today , you 've got to go straight there and you 've got a lot of points to defend ? it 's not going to be easy to go straight there .
do you think the new road map has been short sighted in its treatment of the top players , because it seems the top players are being penalized for going further in tournaments ?
just another question related to dubai . i was wondering what you thought about the uaa 's decision to deny shapira a visa , preventing her from playing in the tournament ?
getting back to the match . you made a few unforced errors in the third set . what was the reason ? was it because you were feeling pretty tired already ?
it 's possible that you could face amelie again in dubai .
in your section . how would you go about getting over this and turning the match over if you have to play her again ?
are you still enjoying your week in paris even with this loss ?
i missed the beginning but are you happy for her in some way ?
was that a bee bothering you there ?
was that giving you more trouble than some of your opponents this week ?
can you talk a little bit about the bee . seems like it was really coming after you .
some of the players choose to take this week off and prepare for the open . you feel playing matches , you ca n't duplicate that in practice ?
razzano is having a good year . this is the fifth time this year you 've beaten her . can you explain why you match up so well against her .
how do you feel about playing against flavia potentially in the semifinals ?
what did you discuss with your coach after she made it 4-3 in the first set ?
why do you think you 've been so successful here at this tournament ?
how many times did you meet with stella mccartney for the new collection ?
do you listen to her father 's music ?
you 've never beaten anna before . what was the difference today ?
since you know her so well , do you see anything in her game that 's preventing her from playing well or is it more mental ?
how are you playing right now ?
i noticed you used the dropshot a lot today . was that intentional , a strategy you went out there with ?
have you looked at the us open draw ?
you 're all in the same section with vera .
any thoughts about your first round ?
you were good on about 83 % of your first serves . she only had 50 % . does that surprise you , that there was such a difference ?
any thoughts on your semifinal match here ? you beat kuznetsova earlier this year . if it 's her or mauresmo , any thoughts on that ?
will you watch ?
who do you prefer to play ?
can you talk about your play this week . you 're going deep into the draw , straight sets .
what would a championship here mean for you ? or are you just wanting to get prepared for the open ?
what do you expect in tomorrow 's match ?
you played her at the yale bowl , too ?
you said you like playing on the outer courts . this will be your first match in the stadium tomorrow . what kind of difficulties does that pose ?
what is it about the smaller courts that you prefer ?
can you talk about the draw in the us open .
the weather forecast for the weekend is rain a little bit tomorrow and a lot on saturday . are you worried if this tournament get pushed to sunday ?
you had a lot of late nights this week . how tired were you going into today 's match ?
are you discouraged about the loss today or happy to have made your first final since returning to the tour ?
you have n't played her in a very long time obviously because you 've been away .
i think the 2008 australian open was the last time you played her . have you noticed her serve improvement , her game improvement , anything that struck you ?
there was a point in the first set that seemed both of you had trouble serving . i think three games in a row ended on double fails . how much of that was being in a final and how much of that was wind and other things ?
you have n't played much lately . what did you get from this that you can use in the us open , and did you go further than you thought you 'd go this week ?
speaking of last night 's match , and you played late on friday night , as well , how did you feel when you woke up this morning ? did you feel like you were ready to play your best tennis or were you a little bit fatigued and sore or stiff or anything like that ?
is there any point during the match where you felt like you had your full energy , or were you kind of fighting that the entire match ?
with the double faults , which is something new for you since your comeback , but they do n't seem to get you down , or do they ? do they get you down when you have a couple in a game , or do you just -- you seem to be able to shake them off .
i 'm the captain of a kids tv show , and one of our viewers has sent in a question for you . bear with me . i have to read it . it goes , hi , maria . my name is kimberly from ajax , ontario . my friends call me kim . i 'm 11 years old . i like watching you play tennis . i play tennis too . i also like skipping rope and playing volleyball , and i watch hockey with my dad . what other sports do you play for fun , and do you watch sports with your dad ?
do you watch sports with your dad ?
there was a point where the crowd tried to kind of will you back into the match i thought in the second set . could you feel the emotion there , sort of they were trying to urge you on ?
are you completely healed now ?
can you tell us what it means to you to play in the first all-russian final at the rogers cup and what it means to see so many young russian players emerging on the tour these days ?
for the serbian world of tennis , you won this tournament . you were in cincinnati last week , and you had a tough match with jelena jankovic . do you think that you would win cincinnati too if you passed jelena ?
when you 're playing against maria , are you playing against her and against the crowd at the same time ?
why not ?
there were some pretty long rallies out there . you seemed to get the better of some of those . do you take a lot of pride in just going , getting balls that look like they 're not going to be too easy to get ? both in the corners and at the net you really seem to work hard .
you 've got the us open coming up , and you mentioned earlier this week you still have goals for your career . you beat serena yesterday , maria today . do you feel you 're ready to realize , you know , some more goals for your career ?
you mentioned on court that you 've been coming here for a long time to this tournament , i think the first time in 1999. do you remember that first trip here to this tournament , where you were then versus where you are now as a tennis player ?
the other players often refer to you as a grinder . you hear that over and over . she 's a grinder . she 's a grinder . do you like that description of your game ?
the service problems you were having today , how much was it you having them and how much was it her return game ?
you lost your last two service games of the first set and all five service points in the tiebreak .
you did n't start grunting until the second set , and i thought that was going to be a sign that you were coming back . could you say when you do and when you do n't grunt ?
no rhyme or reason ?
can you talk about your opponent 's play today ? was she much tougher than the first three players you faced in this tournament ?
it was strange . you seemed very in control . you were serving for the first set , and then it was -- it all seemed to go away . did you feel that it was n't happening today , or did she take it away from you ?
on a day like this , do you feel the fire ? we 've seen you play with such fire at different times . it was hard to tell today . were you feeling it , you know , as you do in the big matches ?
you 've played her many times over the years , and she 's always had a really good ground game , but can you talk a little bit about the fact that she 's serving better , does that make a difference in the matchup now ?
can you talk about how a match like this would change your preparation for the us open ?
what did you learn from playing her today ? you said you learned a lot . you 're going to take away a lot .
why do you think you 've been so dominant so far this tournament ?
it looked like you got into some rhythm today . you really -- once you started to roll , you started to roll . can you talk about how you felt out there ?
i saw your hitting partner was making notes . is that something new , a new deal between you and him ?
what do you think about your match tomorrow against elena ?
she was saying she might have some kind of advantage in longer rallies . this is a slower surface than in wimbledon . do you find that court a little slower and might that prolong rallies ?
you look fresh as a daisy . do you feel fresh as a daisy ?
what have you done since the match to make sure you 'll be fresh tomorrow ?
you did n't look tired at the end at all almost . did you feel tired ?
how did you take all the challenges ? what was going through your mind when all the drama was taking place on court ?
does that win rank among the bigger or maybe the biggest of your career thus far ?
in the first two sets you had so many opportunities to close them out . i 'm just wondering how you stayed focused and kept your composure as you did and able to pull off the victory .
jelena said you were able to beat her by finding the angles and keeping the ball low . would you agree with that ?
someone asked jelena what the difficulty was with playing you , and she said it was playing someone with nothing to lose . did you feel that that was the way you attacked the match ? did you have nothing to lose , in your mind ?
did you feel coming into this week that you might play this well , or has it been a bit unexpected ?
you say there are some things in your game you still want to work on . what do you plan on tackling first ?
what was going through your head when you lost that first set in a heartbreaking fashion ?
talk a bit about the trouble you guys faced out there with the wind and how maybe you made the adjustments that samantha could n't as the match went on .
the first set featured eight service breaks , including six to force a tiebreak . seems pretty unusual . have you been in a match like that before where it seemed like neither of you could really hold serve ?
you seemed to be looking toward your coach a lot . could you tell us what that was all about ?
did you feel like you needed support ?
it 's early , but can you talk about the potential in your next match , please .
the match against serena at wimbledon is obviously a classic . i 'm wondering how long did it take for you to maybe get that out of your head ? are you still thinking about it maybe going into tomorrow 's match , just how tough it was of a match , and how you came close to maybe getting into the final of a grand slam and the disappointment that came with that .
you have n't been playing so good this year , though . is that one that really kind of stuck with you as a loss ? because it seemed like had you made it to the finals , who knows what would have happened ?
you 've got two olympic medals and you 're russia 's probably best federation cup player , but you pick up magazines and most of the time you see pictures of maria and that kind of thing . is there a rivalry there between the two of you ?
do you feel underrated at all ?
you said you expected tomorrow 's match to be very different from the wimbledon one . what do you think will be different , given the different surface and the situation ?
can you please tell me how the court is playing , if it 's fast , slow , what the court surface is like ?
do feel there is a rivalry building between you and serena ?
you have a dealt with some criticism early in your career before you won a title on the tour . it took you a little while . is there some unfinished business until you can win a grand slam , do you think , to make your career complete ? is that something where you think , until you retire or until you get that , that the career might still have that little bit of hole in it ?
there 's a potential for three russian ladies to be in the semifinals of the rogers cup . why do you think that russian women have had so much success on the tour so far this season ?
after you won your match , dropped to your knees , you seemed very excited to win . yet it 's just a quarterfinal ; you are the fourth seed .
why so much relief , i guess , just to get to where you 're supposed to get ?
can you tell me a little bit about players training in russia ? i read recently that most of the players that come from russia are not training there . they 're going to europe or to the united states to train , and there does n't seem to be the infrastructure available for up-and-coming players .
looked like you were really on your game in the first set and really kind of struggled in the middle . do you know yourself why you can be so powerful for the first set and then kind of hit those little bumps ?
is that something you kind of have to manage as you go along to your own expectations ?
is that when you kind of go like that sometimes ?
you have a good chance of closing the gap in the rankings . i 'm just wondering , the season-ending rankings , are they important for you this year or are you still very much looking towards the us open as the no.1 priority ?
dogs stay away from the breakfast this morning ?
as a fan of the doubles game and particularly how you and venus play well together , some of us were disappointed that the two of you did not elect to be a doubles team . i just want to know do you only play doubles in grand slam events ?
you mentioned earlier maybe needing to better control your emotions a little more . that aside , how else do you feel about your performance so far in the tournament ?
you mentioned you were n't very happy with your serve , but compared to some of the problems the other players have been having , your serve has been very solid over the years . do you have any feelings for why that is ?
but you never seem to have had as much of a crisis with confidence .
with all the playing obligations you have with all the different tournaments , can you give us a sense as to how much fatigue is playing a role at this time of the season and if you maybe have to hold back in favor of saving yourself for a grand slam ?
i want to ask again about twitter . you and your sister venus twitter a lot back and forth as if you 're texting each other , but hundreds of thousands of people are reading that . can you tell us why you like to basically have kind of sister conversations in front of hundreds of thousands of people ?
do you text each other as well , or is that your main way of fast communication ?
what are your thoughts on kim clijsters ' comeback ?
what do you think is better for women 's tennis , to have a dominant no.1 player like roger on the men 's side or to have a lot of different people that reach that no.1 position ?
you and your sister have been on the tour for some time now and i 'm sure inspired a lot of young american girls to pick up a tennis racquet . that being said , how come in your opinion we have n't seen more emerging american talent on the tour in recent years such as other countries like russia , for example ?
anyone in particular you want to give us a heads-up on ?
i could n't help but noticing that you have the blue on today . does that having have anything to do with the dolphin situation ? there has been a lot of talk about you and venus getting into the miami dolphins . i know you talked about it last night , but could you maybe just expand on it a little bit ?
teal blue , sort of , yeah .
that 's like a teal blue ; white , orange , blue .
can you just talk a little bit about that , though ? there is a lot of talk ...
do you have a preference playing in the afternoon or at night ? were you a little surprised that you were playing in the afternoon draw and not again at night ?
do you understand maybe why they had clijsters and sharapova on tonight ? kind of a good story , i guess .
good for you .
burning calories aside , when you go deep in a tournament like this up against a grand slam , is there concern about fatigue ?
i mean , what is it about taking off some pounds ? are you serious about that ? do you feel like you need to take off pounds before the us open ?
come on .
with safina out , is it somewhat disappointing the no.1 and no.2 wo n't meet in the final ?
the wta president was in on tuesday . the issue about players making noise when they 're hitting shots came up again . obviously it was a big topic at the french open . can you maybe just address what it 's like playing against somebody who , you know , when they hit , they hit , and they 're loud as opposed to , say , like today it was very quiet out there ?
what do you know about your opponent tomorrow ? what would you look forward to in tomorrow 's game ?
you played well in the first set and struggled in the second . what was going through your mind when you were getting ready to start the third ?
coming into the match , shahar peer did n't really do very well in the last month or two against top 10 players . i want to know if you were surprised by all the fight she had and the relative ease she had in returning your serve ?
did the heat affect you at all ?
i think it was at the beginning of the third set you grabbed your upper left hamstring and looked towards your box . did you hurt yourself at all today ?
you mentioned yesterday that because you had been partnered with ai sugiyama you kind of knew her weaknesses and were able to use that to your advantage . how did you prepare for an opponent like peer ?
do you have a preference for playing in the morning or afternoon ? were you a little bit surprised that you and serena , the top two seeds left , were both playing in the afternoon today ?
i wanted to ask you about , there has been a lot of talk about players and the noise they make when they 're hitting the ball . some players obviously make a lot more noise than others do . has there been talk about how much noise you make and if anybody has approached you or other players about keeping the noise level down ?
oh , i 'm fine .
basically ...
what are your thoughts on kim clijsters ' comeback ?
what do you think she can bring to the tour ?
after toronto , what will you do to get ready for the open ? when will you go to new york and what kind of physical and mental preparation will you take ?
at the end of the third set you held off four game points at 4-all , and then it was five match points until you converted to win the match . can you tell us what was going -- that was a long period of time . can you tell us what was going through your head ?
obviously you 've got to get through tomorrow , but if you end up meeting serena , is she a player that at her best can be beaten , or does she have a weakness you can exploit , or do you sometimes sort of wait for her to beat herself ? what 's the key there ?
way off topic here , but what do you think about the transportation around the grounds here at the rogers cup ?
we 're doing a story on the transportation .
i just wanted to ask you about those splits and how often you do that . that was awesome .
well , you watched all the photographers , too , and it was just like -- it was awesome .
little off topic , but there is a report that you and your sister are going to buy a share of the miami dolphins tuesday or something like that . care to comment on that ?
is that the motivation , to expand the brand , or is there something else beyond that in terms of ownership and being an african-american owner of an nfl team sort of thing ?
the bondarenko sisters have caused your family some trouble in this tournament . any comment on your upcoming match ?
i was reading on twitter that your dogs ate your dinner before the match .
can you tell us their names and what they had ?
where are they when you play ? do they often travel with you ?
pretty sketchy ?
did n't you give her four in one game when she was at ad ? i think she won all the points on double faults . is that a first ?
you 're starting to sound like dinara . have you heard her when she comes in after losing ? she 's very hard on herself .
what do you take out of the match ?
you were saying the longer you were out there the worse you were playing . how important is it then that you set the tone early in the first set ?
could you just talk about your serve a little bit ? obviously it was a problem today . since you 've come back from injury , just how has your serve been , and is this unusual for you ?
has it been something you 've been fighting since you 've come back ? or how has your serve been , excluding today , how has your serve been really ?
during your rehabilitation , the long road you had to come back , did you ever think even for a moment that , you know , maybe i do n't want to return ? was that ever a question , whether to come back to the court ?
because you were gone so long , do you think it was natural people were speculating whether you 'd retire or whether you had the desire to get back , given all the other things you 've got going on in your life ?
a lot of the top seeds have been eliminated very early in this tournament . your thoughts on what that means for you and the rest of this tournament ?
how would you describe the rivalries in women 's tennis right now ? what 's your opinion ?
just is it at the high point of women 's tennis , or are we at a little bit of a low point ? do you find them interesting , compelling ?
what 's it like for you competing at a tournament as an unseeded player ?
this tournament is considering something different in 2011 when the men 's draw and the women 's draw will be the same week . they 're thinking about having half the men in toronto and half the women in toronto , half the men in montreal and half the women in montreal with the finalists flying to the other city .
really ?
well , the finalists from toronto would have to go to montreal . the women 's finalists from montreal would have to come to toronto .
oh , tennis canada is talking about it , a way to generate interest , give toronto and montreal a feel for what a mixed tournament is like .
stacey allaster yesterday was talking about the issues of grunting and noise during matches . as a player who makes a little bit of noise when you hit as opposed to some players who do n't make any noise , other players obviously make a lot , how would you feel if you were approached to tone down the noise , or if the tour wanted to eliminate it entirely ?
how disappointed are you right now ?
what happened with your serve today ?
the last time you played this opponent you beat her rather easily . what was the difference today , and were you surprised by the strength of her play ?
did she play much stronger than the last time you played her ?
you called your coach down before the third set and then halfway through the third set . what were you asking him to help you with ?
i was a little surprised that you were playing at 11:00 a.m. this morning . were you surprised that the defending champion ...
was time a factor at all ?
you lost your cool in the second set . what was going through your mind at that point ?
on a different topic , this tournament is thinking of switching formats in 2011 where half of the women and half of the men will play in toronto ; the other half would play in montreal until the final when somebody would get on a plane and fly to the other city . i can see by your expression you have n't heard of that . i was wondering what you might react to that .
at 2-all you had a ball you hit out by that much to make it 3-2 for you . does it drive you crazy that sometimes tennis matches are decided by such small margins ?
how were you feeling before the match , and what did you and your coach talk about in regard to this opponent ?
you had 17 double faults and a couple times you double-faulted twice to give away a game . when you 're serving like that , is it because your toss is wrong ? do you ever understand why you just ca n't get your first serve in ?
and when you 're serving badly , you ca n't have confidence in the rest of your game ? is that kind of what happens ?
i know you 'd rather not have this much time between now and when the us open starts , but what sorts of things would you do now that you have a little bit of break in between ? what sorts of things will you work on ? will you take some time to rest ? what 's your plan now between now and the open ?
when you feel your fundamentals are starting to slip , do you get into some sort of routine to get back on track ?
is there something you tell yourself when you 're struggling with your serve to try to get back to what 's gotten you to the point you 're at right now ?
how do you feel about this win ? what does it mean to you in your career ?
knowing that you were going to face no.1 in the world , what did you do to prepare for today 's match ?
could you tell that dinara was beginning to lose confidence in herself and was struggling with her own games , not just what you were doing ?
after the second set you went inside the stadium for a few minutes . what did you do ? what was going through your head ?
after the second set you went inside the stadium for a minute . what were you thinking of -- what were you doing ?
when you see that your opponent is losing her confidence , like you said , and she commits 17 double faults , where is your mindset when you see that happening ?
off topic a little bit , but this tournament is changing formats in two years ' time where in toronto half of the men and half of the women would play and montreal half of the men and half of the women would play . then for the sunday final , one would fly to the other city . what do you think of that idea ?
half of the men and half of the women in toronto , and half of the men and half of the women in montreal for the same week .
for the final , one would fly to the other city .
you said before the match you were with your family and your brother and just trying to stay relaxed .
so when you left the court and you saw them -- i assume you 've seen them since you won ?
what did they say to you ?
you guys spend so much time in the heat . do you find it hot out there today or was that just normal ?
can we just get your cousin 's name and where he lives ?
he 's from toronto ?
more pleasant to play in that kind of weather than a few days ago ?
what kind of a weather player do you consider yourself ? do you consider on a hot day of the year an advantage over your opponent most of the time or a disadvantage ?
do you feel like it 's hot ? because you 're so -- i mean , every day you go to work . you 're playing in the hot sun all over the world , so do you even notice it ?
a lot of the top seeds have dropped out very early in this tournament . your thoughts on that , the upsets ?
this off topic a bit , but this tournament is thinking of switching formats in two years ' time . one idea they have is that half of the men and half of the women will play in toronto for a week and half of the men and half of the women will play in montreal for the same week .
and then fly to the other city for the final on sunday .
what do you think of that idea ?
do you know dinara very well ?
i mean , when she was here after her match , she was very upset and very hard on herself , you know , like really criticizing different parts of her game . is that maybe an obstacle for her ? maybe she is too hard on herself maybe ?
what is your take on sugiyama 's game today ?
you had the tough match with venus in the semifinal in stanford and she played very well .
but i mean then she plays not very well the next day , and then she loses to pennetta last week , and then plays terrible yesterday . maybe you bring out the best in her . i do n't know .
it seems that every time you 'd get momentum in the match you would give it back right away . do you have any reasons why you think that might be ?
what was more nerve-wracking ? today 's match or yesterday 's doubles match ?
always pressure playing in front of your home crowd , your home crowd obviously being canadian . seems like the rogers cup is putting a lot more effort in terms of promoting you , putting on the magazine covers . i think you were named after a grandstand court today . is there added pressure , or how do you feel and respond to that ? do you feel there are more expectations ?
how disappointed are you ? you came in here with some pretty high hopes , i imagine . and to go out in the first round is tough ?
regardless of today 's results , what are the goals for finishing the year ? is the top 20 still ...
what do you do the rest of the week ? are you in doubles ?
just how good is her serve ?
could you talk a little bit about the schedule that you guys have ? i mean , you 're playing pretty much every week in different parts of the world . you lost in your first-round match today . does tiredness come into it at all ? it 's pretty tough to play every single week and be at the top of your game all the time .
the fact that there are now so many good canadian players at least in the top 200 , how do you feel that bodes for the canadian team in fed cup ? in other words , do you feel it 's a realistic goal that canadian could be in world group ii as they were in i believe 2007 ?
late in the second set you missed an open smash at the net . then you were broken soon after . was there a moment in particular where you felt it was starting to come undone ?
do you feel like now you have more time to prepare for the us open just because you lost so early ?
do you normally enjoy having a first-round bye , or does it make it difficult when you come up against a player like kateryna who 's already got a few matches under her belt ?
chairman and ceo of the wta stacey allaster called you the modern-day billie jean king in terms of promoting the game . how does that make you feel ?
can you give us any details about what you 'll do between now and the open in terms of preparation and where you 'll go and how you 'll spend your days ?
anything in particular you 're going to work on ?
how much of a factor was the weather , especially in the second and third sets ?
it 's just been so long since you were here in toronto . is it a little disappointing that you were n't able to stay a little longer in the tournament , considering it 's been that long ?
you looked really , really solid in the first set , and it looked like you came out on fire . can you tell us what happened , how things got turned around ?
you mentioned kateryna running down the balls . what was her strongest point over the course of the day ?
kateryna was asked when she felt that she could win the match . she said it was at 5-4 in the third set . she kind of dead-panned that . when did you feel the match slipping away for yourself ?
i guess the first question i want to ask you is regarding playing today with your opponent . did she do anything at all to surprise you ? did you know anything about her before you played her ?
just to follow up , it was a very , very strange match . all the points were very , very long , three hours . you called your coach twice . i just wanted to know if you could just give us an idea what was going on in your mind ? because after the first set you trailed 4-0 , and then you really fought back . you seemed to have a lot of problem . you broke serve well , but in terms of holding your serve , it seemed to kind of let you down . i wanted to know what your thought process was as the match was going along .
i knew you had a stress -- if i 'm correct , you had a problem with your foot . you were out of the french open . i want to know if you feel now that you 're back to where you want to be or if you feel it 's going to take a few more weeks to really get back to be the very competitive shahar peer that advances deep into the draws of most tournaments .
can you tell us in your own words what happened to you in dubai and how that made you feel , that incident , not being able to play there ?
i 'm led to believe that you 're here because you did n't go to dubai ?
can you give us a sense of your daily routine today here at the rogers cup ? what time do you get up ? when do you eat ? when do you practice before a match and then what do you do after the match ?
you mentioned the attention that the incident in dubai generated .
the attention that the incident in -- the dubai incident in dubai generated around the world . you 've talked a lot about politics and sport . do you ever think the two can be separated , or because people ...
what do you think of the support that -- i know andy roddick decided he was n't going to go and defend his title . what do you think of the support and people spoke out on behalf of you ?
along the same lines , what sort of a reception have you got here in toronto and indeed everywhere you 've gone since dubai ? what have people said to you ?
not only have you inspired so many others around the world , but i also want to get your reaction about this being a very special year in israel in tennis with the israeli davis cup team . does that help you inspire ? because harel levy , what is he ranked 343 ? he beat russia before 10,000. and israel is now semifinal first time in history . i just want to know this year , that started from dubai which was basically a negative thing , if all this is basically turned around , do you feel that everything is positive for israel now , including your play and your game ?
must be nice to get a win like that . you started off a bit shaky but then ended really strong .
it seemed that there was a shift in momentum in the second set . you cracked a crosscourt forehand winner . and can you talk about that or when you felt that you were like coming up out of the not-such-a-great place that you were in the first set ?
after your first-set loss , you asked to talk to your coach . what did you and your coach talk about ?
is that something in the first round where you sometimes can be guilty of coming out a little bit too conservative just because it 's the start of the tournament and you 're maybe not quite warmed up playing ?
you said last week you might have found a service motion that 's working for you again . did you feel that today ?
can you talk a little bit about the impact of having that shot go off and losing confidence in it and the difference it would make if you were to get that back ?
you just mentioned that you were working on new things the last couple of days . can you tell us a little bit about what you 're working on ?
this being your fourth match in four days , how do you feel about your performance today against venus ?
how do you feel about playing doubles tomorrow with your sister ?
where does this in terms of your career ? where does this rank in terms of wins ? how big a win is this for you ?
when you 're down and you lose the first set , you know , 6-1 and then you 're obviously down a set , what 's your motivation to play -- when you 're playing somebody like venus who is such a strong player and you 're down one set , obviously you rebounded well , but is it difficult to come back when you 're down a set like that to somebody who 's your opponent who 's that good ?
you 've not only had to deal with playing so many matches consecutively day after day , but you 've also had to do it in heat . it 's been very hot and muggy and sweaty here . do you feel like you have an advantage that you 've had to play in it before and so now that you 're probably used to it , do you think maybe the players who have n't played as much maybe are n't at as big an advantage as you are ?
so is there a concern on your part of being able to conserve your energy at all ? how do you focus on being able to save your energy when it 's so hot every day ?
do you think your defense surprised her today ?
what was different today ?
what impact do you think your win against venus today is going to have going forward in your career ?
just seemed like your serve kind of let you down a bit today . was that a comfort thing ?
can you just tell us how disappointed you are right now ?
seemed like you came in with a lot of confidence just from winning the tournament , and then also last year 's rogers cup . were you feeling pretty good about your game going into the tournament ?
were you nervous at all ? was that anything to do with it with the crowd ?
because you are finding some success on the tour and especially with last year 's tournament , are you finding that players are n't maybe -- they 're starting to know your game a little bit more ? it 's harder to catch maybe a surprise a bit ?
this year you have been able to stay consistent and fit . this is the key of your success at the end ?
the last time you won this tournament i think you got a walkover in the final . this time you had to play for it . does it make it sweeter this time , especially considering the fact you finished undefeated this year ?
you seemed to have an easy time on your service games today . was it because your serve was that good or was venus struggling with her returns ?
now that you 're finishing the world no.1 , do you still think the ranking system should be modified at all next year ?
you were a hundred percent . do you think venus was a hundred percent , too , during this match physically ?
can you tell us why you wo n't go to the fed cup final in italy ?
can you describe what you feel on the court against serena ?
there were a lot of people on the court supporting you today . what did you think of the crowds in doha ? were you happy ?
what was the level of your fitness out there ? were you struggling with leg problems ?
but were you injured ?
do you think serena played a very good match or a normal match ?
you obviously played a pretty tough three-setter yesterday , whereas serena had a shorter match when wozniacki retired . do you think that was a factor at all ?
the players ' mandatory commitment this year is reduced , yet there seem to be just as many leading players carrying injuries . have you had any time to think about what you will need to do to get through 2010 without injury ?
four failed to finish the tournament .
yes .
is it difficult for you when serena takes your title , like in wimbledon or here ?
can you explain exactly what you feel .
it 's special because you have one match with tears and you have a lost match with a smile . how can you explain that ? after this match , you were smiling .
did you take a bit of a risk to even play the match today , considering all that you 'd been through earlier in the week ?
were you surprised to see yourself in the semifinals after what happened yesterday ?
considering what 's happened during this week , do you have any regrets to have played luxembourg ?
considering the first two big matches and the two last ones , are you happy with your tournament ?
did you learn anything you did n't know before coming here ?
what is your feeling after this long match ?
is there a reason why , between you and her , it 's always very , very tough every match ?
you mentioned the vacation . it 's going to be a happier one for you than it looked like at the start of this week when you seemed to be struggling for form . you 've ended a lot better than you started , have n't you ?
you 're ranking has gone from 1 to 8 over the last 12 months . can it go in the opposite direction in 2010 ?
both players today ended up with more unforced errors than winners . is that sort of an indication of how tough it is to play in that humidity ?
last time you arrived in australia , you were the no.1 seed for the australian open , but you got sick in hong kong and did n't have a very happy month . there will be less expectations on you on your return this january . is that a good thing or a bad thing ?
this match was very sad for you today . can you explain how you experienced it ?
after the two three-setters you played , would it be disappointing if you did n't advance ?
you have your thigh iced now . is that the hamstring that 's sore from last week or something different ?
you knew before the beginning that you would not be able to play at a hundred percent ?
will you follow the match between azarenka and radwanska ?
is it special because all three of you are friends ?
how do you feel playing here ? and how do you feel sending wozniacki to the semifinals ?
you were trailing 2-5 in the second set . did you expect this sort of comeback ?
it was easier than expected ?
you have nothing to lose .
have you seen venus ?
did you know whether you win or lose that you could not qualify for the semifinal , before the game ?
so do you have a thought to just let elena win , so a russian can go to the semifinal ?
actually , you lost a lot of games in this tournament . what does this victory mean for you ?
now this is the end of your season , what goals do you have for next year ? where do you want to improve ? do you think there are things the tour can improve on ? there was a lot of talk about the ranking system being changed . do you agree with that ?
when are you going to start your preparation for the next season ?
only two weeks of holiday ?
it was a strange match , a strange qualification for you , in the semifinals .
in the first game you lost very quick . today you have done a great job . how did you step up your performance in just two days ?
would you say the conditions outside maybe are preventing people from playing their best tennis ?
last year you were the world no.1 in doha . this year you are the last player to qualify here . how do you evaluate your performance in 2009 ? what 's your expectation for next year ?
would it be fair to say after your first match you seemed to be thinking , i 'm going into the winter layoff period now to regroup and plan for next year , then all of a sudden dinara gets injured and caroline gets hurt , if you like , and you win both matches ? it 's changed for you now , has n't it ?
but it 's fair to say that the message you gave after your first match was qualification was beyond you ?
can you talk a little bit about the strength at the moment in women 's tennis with kim clijsters back , justine henin returning next year . is that a good thing or do you think that 's going to make things a lot more tough for you ?
that was a remarkably fluctuating match . you came back from love-6 and almost won it in the end .
both of you seemed to be suffering from physical problems out there . you had the trainer on . she was near to collapsing . any explanation for that ?
you came in as an alternate . did that make things very difficult ? would you have preferred it to have worked out that dinara retired before playing yesterday ?
when you were lying on the court two points away from victory , it looked pretty scary . were you scared at the time ?
how do you feel now physically ?
there 's every chance you will play tomorrow ?
you have no intention whatsoever of conceding that matching ?
you won two big matches . you are not sure to be in the semifinal . how do you deal with that ?
you seemed on the verge of victory there up 5-2 in the second set . can you explain how she fought her way back into the match ? did you lose focus or did she start playing better ?
you won two very emotional matches so far . somehow you kept your mental strength . how can you explain that ?
can you tell us what treatment you had ?
what do you think about this match ? it was a tough match .
there is no reason why ?
you have tomorrow a tough game . it wo n't be easy for both of you . can you focus on your game to win and maybe to pass to the semifinals ?
are you ready physically for tomorrow ?
no problem ?
are you sure you can be in the semifinal , even if you win ?
but you prefer to just play without counting ?
are you happy with your performance ? are you satisfied with your performance by the end of this year ?
i mean after the grand slam , after french open .
i want to know how you feel in this competition ? we see wozniacki , but you are here and very near the semifinal .
you will face kuznetsova tomorrow . if you win the game , you can make it to the semifinal . what is your expectation of the next game ?
that must give you a degree of some satisfaction , losing the first set probably you want to forget , losing a game in the second set the last 20 minutes , still keeping together and coming through in three hours ?
20 minutes .
having said that , you were 3-5 down in the final set , two match points against you .
one , was it ?
how do you feel about that stage of the match ?
to perform out there for three hours in a match of such intensity suggests that the left thigh is not as bad as it looked with all the strapping .
do you think you 'll be able to get through the week safely ?
jelena was saying all the players here are injured . why do you think that is ?
that 's what she said .
how significant was it that victoria totally lost her composure at the crucial points of the match ?
you chose to use the heat rule , which is unusual for a night match . what can you do in those 10 minutes to get yourself together a little bit ?
correct me if i 'm wrong , but she 's about your best friend on the tour , is n't she ?
we obviously are quite used to see two sisters play each other . a lot of the spanish guys say it 's difficult to play good friends . what can you say to victoria in the locker room after something like that , or did you not talk ?
what did your father tell you when he came on the court ?
the two of you personify the new generation . we can hope that you 'll go on and play many great matches like that in the future . do you view yourself as the new generation , with the belgians coming back and everything like that ? do you think there 's a new wave in women 's tennis coming through ?
who else ? there 's yourself and victoria .
dinara safina is out . you 're no.1 again . you 're almost in the semifinals . how do you feel ?
were you aware before you started that safina was out of the tournament ?
and so the no.1 spot was a surprise to you when you got off the court ?
you are on the fed cup team and your sister is not . a bit surprising for us .
yes . especially after monday , where venus talked so enthusiastically about being in italy to play the final .
do n't you think without venus it will be a little bit more difficult , because the others are very young ?
you played a tough game against svetlana yesterday . today you fought well against venus . how far can you go in this tournament ?
a bit of mixed feelings getting no.1 and winning the match but beating your sister like that ?
compared to the us open , do you think your level is higher ?
my opinion is you 're playing much better here .
you may have seen today talk about andre agassi 's upcoming book where he apparently reveals that he took crystal meth in the 1990s . as someone who has known him for a long time , what was your reaction to that revelation ?
what about the fact that he apparently tested positive on a drug test in '97 but was let off by the atp tour after saying he took it by mistake ? are you surprised somebody can be let off that easily like that ?
yeah .
hope there 's no revelations like that in there .
this is your second defeat . the title seems to be away from you . you were suffering on your serve . what was happening with you out there ?
what happened with you exactly ? your fitness ? you were hitting the ball outside .
were you happier with the way you played today compared with yesterday ?
what are some plus points in the performance ?
how about fed cup ?
yes .
you are not on the list .
why are you not on the list ?
do you think the team will be in a difficult situation without you ?
it 's a little early to be asking , but if you 're to get through 2010 in the shape you want to be , have you got to change anything ?
to get through next year , the whole season , be in good shape most of the time , is there anything you have to change or do differently ?
you may have heard there 's been a lot of talk in the media today about andre agassi 's book where he reveals he used crystal meth in the '90s , but was let off by the atp tour . as someone who has known him , what was your reaction to that and if you were surprised that he was able to get off that easily after testing positive for something like that ?
what 's your reaction to his revelation that he used that in the '90s ?
now serena is no.1 . what do you feel about this result ?
what is the injury , dinara ?
must be desperately disappointing for you . not completing your program here means you lose the no.1 ranking also .
your brother , amongst other people , were saying in shanghai , because of all the injuries on the men 's tour , that the year is just too long . the women 's tour is considerably shorter than the men 's tour . i guess it 's still tough to last all year without getting hurt .
do you think you played too many tournaments this year ? will you cut back on your schedule next year ?
you now have the winter break . are you confident by the end of it you will have fully recovered and be recharged and ready to go again ?
how serious a blow would that be if that were the case ?
what did the doctor say ? is it just rest that 's going to cure it or maybe surgery or what ?
did he give you any time in terms of months or weeks ?
what had your schedule been for january ? were you playing lead-up tournaments in australia or elsewhere ?
and with all your points from the australian open , too , how devastating would it be not to be able to play there ?
are n't you afraid to stay six weeks without tennis ?
do you suffer any pain when you 're not on the court ? is the pain there all the time or does it come when you try to play ?
marat has had back problems . have you spoken to him ? a couple years ago he had a back problem .
ribs , sorry .
do you feel lucky today because you won the match with less effort ?
wozniacki showed great tennis tonight with azarenka . what do you think about your game with her ?
obviously the big story today in tennis is andre agassi . were you surprised to hear about his drug test and what is your reaction to that ?
your start was excellent , but then you lost the rhythm of the game . what happened ?
what happened to you emotionally at the end when you received those two code violations ?
you were saying about your personality ?
you were on the brink of qualification with match point . you probably would have gone through to the semifinals had you taken that point . must be quite frustrating for you ?
this is strange because you won more points than your opponent . what do you think about these stats ?
every player can learn a lesson from each match . what would you say the lesson you learned from today is ?
are you angry against yourself for letting it slip through your fingers ?
the two of you are good friends , best of friends on the tour . is it more difficult losing a match against somebody who you view as a very close friend than it is to lose against an ordinary player ?
you 're not sure if you 're going to play with safina or zvonareva . does n't make any difference for you ?
you know caroline pretty well also on court . in which ways could you feel that she was injured today in certain parts of her game ? and do you normally play that many dropshots ?
and dropshots ?
are you disappointed on the two double-faults ?
you played very well during all the match .
do you think between venus and serena , serena will win tomorrow ?
you look very sad . do you have any regrets about the game at 4-3 for her where it could have been 4-all ?
the early break in the first set put you off straightaway ?
you lost , but you are still in the competition . how do you think you are going to do ?
where will you do that work , and who will you do it with ?
when you see players like azarenka and wozniacki coming through , does it kind of remind you of yourself a few years ago coming onto the scene , playing without any inhibitions ?
talking about the weather , did that affect your performance ?
great comeback after you lost the first set . what was the turning point or the key ? you committed 15 unforced errors .
after a poor start , you controlled the game . what was the turning point ?
this is your third win over venus , first one since miami 2004 .
what do you feel about it ?
you say 'one more time . ' do you kind of sense she 's not quite the player she was a few even months ago ?
first time in the wta masters and first win . what can you tell us more about the game ? it seems it was an easy game against jankovic . she said that she gave you the game and she was not in the mood to win the game . what can you tell us about what happened on the court ?
you served particularly well until that one game where you were broken , then carried on in the same vein afterwards . you must have been pretty pleased with that part of your game tonight .
questions about tomorrow 's match . what do you expect from wozniacki ? how is it to play against your friend ?
obviously , you were playing very well today and you were coping with the weather very well . how far can you go in the tournament and how much do you think you can cope with the weather ? it 's not an easy tournament .
first of wall , what was the injury exactly and when did it start hurting ?
and today , was there any point before the match that you really were n't going to play this final ?
what was is the official injury ?
in the quad ?
you just could n't move to the left on the backhands ?
what about her game , degree of improvement or difficulty ?
is there any letdown factor after facing venus ?
did you think beforehand that , hey , i could still beat this girl ?
i know you love collecting titles . this would have been the six to pass steffi and tie andre . a little bummed about that ?
do you see any upside for women 's tennis with the new face up there ?
after a good first quarter of the year , what are the thoughts heading into the clay court season ?
how much rest will be required , do you think , before you get back at it ?
how is your motivation now compared to other seasons about what you want to accomplish and how you 're feeling excitement-wise ?
you lasted a lot longer than most players in the top 10. you have to be proud of that .
what parts of her game have improved since you played her last year at roland garros ?
you looked a little winded at the end of the match . what was your fatigue level as it went on ?
how did you like her chances against venus or serena ?
did you notice some nerves out there from victoria at some points in the match ?
why do you say your fitness not where it should be right now ?
how was this first tournament without a coach ?
i read recently that you have a tattoo ; is that true ?
what is it and when did you get it and why ?
did you get a little shaky on both sides out there at the end ?
how big a deal is it to you to get through a match of such importance against such an experienced player and to prove that you can win like that ?
do you feel like there 's really no pressure on you because all the talk is about the williams sisters , and here you make it to the end without much attention ?
do you like coming in as an underdog ? you do n't really have any pressure . you have nothing to lose .
can you talk about the match your played against serena where you withdrew and what that was like for you and what was happening ?
have you revisited that a lot in your mind , or no ?
at the same time , the conditions today , it 's still quite hot . it was a long match . how pleasing is it for you to be been able to deal with those conditions ?
you played her three times before . did you do something different to your game today ? is it simply the result of all the hard work you 've been putting in ? did you go out with a different game plan ?
what was going through your mind when you lost the first match point and then you lose the game on the double fault ? what was the thought process at that point ?
where does this achievement rank in your list of personal achievements in your mind ? how big is that for you compared to everything else you 've done in your career ?
you 've had a lot of success in other competitions . did you every think at 19 you would be in a top tier final ?
just to look at your final , we do n't know who it 'll be yet . just look at each player individually . first serena . what is it like trying to play against serena williams ?
how important is your conditioning when you play almost three hours in this match ? did you work extra hard for this tournament ?
when you think about all the work that you 've put in , what was going through your mine when you got the last point and were able to celebrate ?
do you have any idea what the reaction back home is going to be like for your victory ?
you had a lot of shots that looked like you just hit them too hard . was it difficult for you to sort of stay calm and not get swept up in the excitement and the emotion of the match ?
do you have any ideas of what you 're going to do between now and the final ?
can you talk about the circumstances of when you came to the states ? i think you 're sponsored or you have a family of an nhl player this helps you out . how did that come to be ?
family friend ?
and you came because there was n't enough competition where you are ? you wanted to come practice in the states ?
when was that that you came to the states ? it 's in scottsdale , right ?
how much has their involvement helped you grow as a player ?
did it help that he 's been a professional athlete too ? even though it 's a different sport , he can give you some guidance and support ?
how to handle people like us ?
no , but has he helped you with that , too ?
are they here ?
when you think about playing in the final , do you get the sense that you 're on the brink of something special for you in your career ?
when you talk about getting excited , how important are matches like this to help you deal with nerves and the pressure that comes with playing on a big stage ?
did you feel at the end of the match that you had more energy than her , that she was a little more fatigued ?
which players did you admire coming up ? who are some players that you liked to watch ?
yeah , either one .
you seemed really in command of that match . did you feel like you gave it away or she took it ?
did you feel like in the beginning you were playing great , that she just seemed like asleep the first five games ?
why do you think that was ? were you surprised ? any idea ?
what did your coach say ?
you 've played both sisters , right ?
can you compare their games ? they really play such different styles . which is more dangerous and difficult for you ?
what 's your coach 's name ?
did you feel like it was more a case where you let the match get away , or she took it and she started playing better ?
you double faulted twice . did that bother you ?
do you feel you played a poor tiebreaker ?
did that affect you , too , knowing you were in that tiebreaker and you could have had the match right there ? when she won , did you feel like you lost a little bit of energy ?
forgive me if this is too personal , but being from china , do you get to keep most of the money that you win in prizes ?
do you personally get to keep most of your prize money ?
are you proud of your fellow chinese players ? this week i think serena had to beat three in a row of you .
are you proud of your fellow chinese players that are top 40 now ? serena almost lost to two of you in the last two days .
which is a more difficult match : serena on hard court or venus on grass ?
which is more intimidating of the two girls ? which is the one that scares you the most if they 're playing well ?
they 're such huge celebrities in the united states . how popular are they in china ?
really ?
if they 're playing each other tomorrow night , that would be something people in china would pay attention to and be interested in ?
and if you say na li in china ?
your english has gotten much better ?
you were in the top 20 , or around 20 , and obviously you were hurt . but do you feel like you 're playing at a level now to get back into the top 20 ?
when did you have your last knee surgery ?
but your confidence is back ? it 's coming back ?
will you be thinking about that second set tiebreaker a lot later today ?
it was mainly the breakpoints that you 're really upset about ?
what was going through your head after you got match point ? you kind of fell to the court .
you 're pretty exhausted ?
you had the trainer out a couple times . can you tell us a little bit about what was going on ?
what does wozniacki do well ?
do you feel like you 've got a pretty good shot at making the finals if you continue to play well ?
you won the title here before . tell us what it means to play here in miami ? do you like the night life ? the conditions ? how does that work for you ?
seems like you kind of fall under the radar . do you like that ? does it bother you ?
how about specifically here . you 're a past winner and you 're playing really well .
how is it going with olga ?
as of when ?
in your life ?
are you if the market for anyone ?
so will you go back to someone at casal , or ...
but you would try to find one as soon as possible , or you 'll be on your own for a while ?
changing the subject , a lot of celebrities like to come to this tournament . have you met any ? have any come to see you personally ?
who was that ?
i know shakira was here yesterday . do you think that 's part of the excitement of this tournament for fans , to people watch and star ...
is it as fun for you to meet a star , do you think , as it is for them to meet you ?
who was the singer ?
what 's the name ?
when was that ?
i love them ; they 're great . ( laughter . ) it 's a he ?
has he come to watch you play tennis ?
can you talk a little bit about the semifinals ? you 're going to play either azarenka or stosur .
electronic line calling , do you feel it 's just a normal part of game at this point ? i mean , it 's been around a few years . hawk-eye .
three . have you ever been on a court that did n't have it and you started to do it and they said , oh , no ?
but why do you think the players do so poorly at getting the call right ?
the players ?
i 'm writing a book entitled , the intangibles of tennis , and i wondered if you could recall when you reached your first wimbledon final against lindsay davenport .
when you were going on court , what went through your mind , what did you think ? can you recall ?
this was in 2000 you 're talking about ?
that 's what you felt ?
when you were walking on the court , on the center court .
okay . may i give you this from last night ?
during the years , your development , you 've developed this inner strength that comes across . whenever you do something that you 're not happy with , you immediately make eye contact with your father on the court . can you explain that ?
no , not recently , not over the last few ...
i 've noticed that . now , your father , of course , has said recently that he does n't have the nerve to watch you when you 're playing in the game . tell me about it . what is your reaction to that ?
well , not just that , with you and your sister , with your doubles -- congratulations , by the way .
the gold , they do go a long way . what do you feel inside about the honor , the strength , to win that ?
you said you think it was my turn . what did you stand with lindsay davenport when you went on the court and you felt it was my turn ?
i thought you said you stood at something or other .
at that point . i think you overtook her eventually .
do you ever go back and look at some of your old games ?
did you have a feeling before today that this was going to be a good day for you ?
you 've had a string of good results after several losses . how does it feel to begin to feel that your game is coming back , that you 're able to struggle with and beat the top players on the tour ? how does it feel ?
do you enjoy playing on clay ? what do you consider to be your best surface ?
looking at the draw for the rest of the tournament , do you think you 've got a good chance here of getting far ?
did you see anything in ana 's game today that made you think during the game that , wow , this is a day i can really do it ? was there something she was not maybe at her top today ?
would you consider this to be the biggest win of your career or top 5 when it comes to wins or how would you rank today ?
what would you consider your biggest ?
in hungary , we 've seen some countries like serbia , for example , where one player breaks through and then suddenly coming after are three or four others . is there many indications that in hungary there are some players ready to follow you through ?
what 's she called ?
would you play doubles with her ?
can you talk about your match , generally how you 're feeling ?
before your injury layoff last year you were consistently beating the top players again . how does it feel to be back to where you were prior to getting sick ?
what specifically did you do well ? what shots worked for you today ?
is this your biggest win ?
did you sense early on from the way she was playing that she was n't perhaps on the top of her game and that this was a day you could really get one over on her ?
did you change your approach at all when you saw that she was making a lot of errors , a lot of double faults , a lot of just bad shots ?
you 're playing doubles later ?
is that tough in one day ?
you did n't play here last year , right ?
but you won in 2007 .
is this kind of a special tournament for you , or you 've won a lot of doubles titles ?
i 'm curious , are you prepared to play someone ranked that highly ? do you actually have time after the draw to sit down and do any sort of video work on them , or is it all in the memory bank ? you 've seen them quite a few times .
are you trying to concentrate more on your singles game now or , you know , when you 're such a strong doubles player , or are you always focused on both the same ?
also happy almost-birthday , correct ?
do you know what you 're going to do on your birthday if you do well tomorrow ? do you have any plans ?
with your new focus on singles , how satisfying is this win in terms of making a name for yourself in singles ?
also , safina is kind of an emotional player . can you use that to your advantage , or do you have to just not look at that at all and focus on yourself when you 're playing ?
how can you use that ? how can the opponent take that ?
last thing . how far can you let yourself look ahead , or not at all ?
after the illness last year , did you ever think you 'd be back here at this point , beating the no.2 players in the world ?
any thoughts on the match today ? you made a lot of mistakes . what was going on ?
what did she do well ?
did all the rain delays affect your concentration and make it more difficult ?
are you surprised by the way you played , or did you feel it going into the tournament that you were n't quite on top of your game ?
do you feel it 's just been one thing coming after another and you do n't have time to stop ?
you had a chance to get to no.1 this week . is it even more disappointing for you because of that ?
ana , talking about the match . you must be pretty frustrated ?
do you think that because you played for so long at indian wells you did n't have the time to prepare for this tournament ?
can you look back until after the french when everything was on a high and maybe you lost some momentum with the injury and things have n't quite settled for you , even with last week 's good result ?
how are things with craig , and what are his thoughts after the match ?
you 've talked about struggling with separating your tennis life and your personal life and staying up thinking about it when you go to bed . is that related today that ?
in a few weeks , jelena and you will be trying to get serbia into the world group for the first time . can you talk about what that would mean for you and also for serbia ?
that was the largest fed cup crowd ever .
what was that like ? what did it feel like ?
do you like that team ? because when jelena and you are basically competitors . i mean , most of the year . then you have to kind of come together as a team . do you like that concept ? is it hard for you or what ?
is that just solely playing for serbia ? some countries , their federations have a lot of money to pay the players . i assume your federation does n't . it could be an expense-only thing . does it matter to you ?
speaking about something very special in a few weeks , you have opportunity to defend your title at the french open . how excited are you about that ?
do you see any parallels with you and jelena with the struggles at the start of this year and last year when you both got to no.1 , first grand slam ? are there some parallels there ?
do you see a new wave of young serbian girls wanting to follow in your footsteps that you have a chance to mentor like you have n't had ?
who was the 15 year old ?
you 've also created a name for yourself on the humanitarian side . can you talk to us a little bit about your humanitarian efforts and what causes are specifically important to you ?
how does it feel to have your opener behind you ?
was the wind much of a factor there ?
does the ball bounce as well on the center court ?
has your adrenaline dropped in the second set ?
did you have any chance to enjoy miami before the tournament started in between indian wells ?
you came obviously close to winning at indian wells last weekend . how much is that pushing you for this tournament ? this surface , is it similar ? the conditions are similar ?
which do you prefer in the early games : to be really tested by someone and have a little bit of a scare that pushes you , or to have a more straightforward like tonight ?
do you have any planned commitments for the next round ?
did you know much about her before the match ?
you constantly say and your bio says how much you like to play in the united states and everything . obviously no visa problems , but can you give other reasons plus that or whatever ?
this is really i think second largest area for jews outside of israel . did you feel that out there ? did you feel a lot of support ?
i know you spoke about it last week , but if you could , talk a little bit about the dubai incident . you came through looking very mature and sensible about how it all played out , but if you could give us your thoughts .
and you feel comfortable that next year there will be no problem if you want to go ?
andy roddick was the only player who decided that he was not comfortable under the circumstances going . can you say how you felt about that , and also if you 've talked with andy about it ?
did you know him pretty well ? i know you have the same agent .
you did n't know him that well ?
could you talk a little bit about tonight , about the second set ?
you mentioned that obviously one of the consequences of dubai was nobody wants to mix sports and politics . davis cup at sweden they did n't allow spectators because of anti-israel protestors . how did you feel about that situation so soon after dubai ?
correct me if i 'm wrong , i think it was two years ago before in the fed cup match with canada that there was another team that was supposed to play israel but they did n't show up again because of some political situation . israel got a forfeit , but all the players were angry about that .
here 's the point , because all this happened with dubai , do you really feel that the political situation with israel will end ? because , again , you represent fed cup , the men are in davis cup , that this thing could happen again .
not that long ago , fed cup and davis cup players basically played for their country and for expenses without any kind of salary . now you have like american players are making big dollars . probably somebody like yourself playing from a smaller country might be getting small amounts of money from your federation . do you feel maybe fed cup and davis cup they should play just for love of country and no money , or ...
i wanted to congratulate you for being a doubles finalist last week . one of the things i noticed in 2009 compared to 2008 , from what i saw of your results your play improved , and i understand you 're working with relatively new coaches . has that helped you either in your technique with strokes or in terms of your concentration ?
i 'm just curious , roger federer , a lot of the top players answered this question . it was n't directed at you . why do you think that 's a subject you 're not talking about ?
about paying fed cup and davis cup players ?
it was n't directed to you .
at indian wells , the fact that both you and andy made it into the finals . i mean , like dudi talks about it that he represents israel when he 's playing in the davis cup . do you feel a special accomplishment that both of you did it ?
of course , but you and andy both .
it was wonderful for you , the fact that both you and andy did it . but it puts israel on the map a little . was that special for you ?
how is your relationship with gisela dulko ? will you play for the whole season ?
your next match is against venus williams . anything that you feel could get you ready for that match ?
you only played her once , am i right ?
anything you can take from that match , or too long ago ?
you 're young . it 's a grand slam . you did n't look nervous out there , or was that deceptive ? were you ?
it 's been a great year for you . you 've been in seven finals at 19 years old . it 's been a great journey for you here , your first grand slam final . you could n't script a better theater to be involved in that out there with kim . while it 's a bitter pill to swallow to lose , do you feel pretty good right now , i mean , about the way the tournament went ?
how can you explain your nerves at your age ? because , i mean , it 's very impressive . and besides the fact , was it easier on your nerves because you played kim and you know her a little bit and obviously everybody likes her ?
once the match was over and kim came over and you were speaking - and then obviously you obviously had wonderful things to say about each other during the awards ceremony - standing up there and maybe now your game face is off a little bit during the awards ceremony , what was going through your mind at that point ?
can you imagine what it would be like to not play for two and a half years and then only play three tournaments back , someone who is has been training straight for as long as you have , can you imagine how hard it would be to take that much time off and to come back quickly like this ?
in the first set you were very close to get the set , and so is there any point which you think , oh , maybe i can win this match ?
so it 's not about your nerves ?
the beginning of the first set , was it a feeling-out process for you , at least for the first two games that you dropped to her and then you won four straight games ? was it feeling her out to figure out what her game is ?
if you could kind of turn the volume up on any one aspect or two aspects of your game , you know , that you think could make a big difference for you on the court , what would they be ?
no , in general . is it the service ? serve ? is it coming to net ? you know , your feel with the volley or what ?
what kind of tactics did you prepare before the match ? scale of 1 to 10 , how good do you think you played ?
when you go back to the hotel tonight , lights go out , you 're going to think about this . is any part of you going to say , i could have won this last night ? i was n't dominated . i played well . i was up for a while . any part of you thinking that way ?
at the end of the short speech at the court , you said few words in polish to the polish friends . why was it so important for you to say the words in polish ?
you took out sort of the giant slayer of this tournament . i would have to think about the way you played tonight , you feel pretty good tonight and the way you 're playing ?
she 's sort of been the crowd favorite this year , but it seemed like there was a lot of support for you out there . i think people have embraced you and your style of play . did you feel it from the crowd ?
you 're going to be playing yanina wickmayer next round . what do you know about her ? have you followed her ? have you seen her play ?
in the on-court interview , when pam spoke of her , she almost spoke of it like it was a foregone conclusion , like , who is she ? she sort of said , you know , you 'll be the overwhelming favorite . she said her name in a way that sounded a little bit belligerent . do you think there is a danger in taking a girl like this for granted ? she 's not here just by good luck and chance .
what do you make of what melanie oudin did during this tournament ?
what was your strategy going into the match ?
you said you played yanina in juniors . can you remember your first match against her ?
would you like to tell us how you practiced with adidas team and how the organization of this team ?
how crucial was it to not fold up like the russians did before you ? how much was that part of the strategy ?
melanie said that you played a very consistent game . was that your game plan going in , is to make sure , limit your mistakes ?
your body language was positive the whole time . was that part of the deal , too ? never show her that you were frustrated even if you were ?
going into the semis , you 're highly the favorite . is n't it a frightening here to have a final ahead of you ?
you have played a lot of matches for the past three weeks because you won new haven and now . i was wondering , how are you feeling about your body , like fatigue or are you tired ?
no injury ?
for people just getting familiar with you as a tennis player , how would you describe yourself as a player , what your strengths are ?
are you going to change your game plan against wickmayer ?
you come from a small country . wickmayer , too . yet this afternoon she has 2,000 boyfriends . how many do you have in denmark now ?
and real boyfriends , how many do you have ?
when you walk into center court , such a big center court , when you walk into the center court , what sort of feeling you get ?
your box was very loud today , the box of people . do you think they just try to unite to be against the whole stadium ?
do you have any special plans for celebrating tomorrow , day off ?
what was the funny story about the t-shirt ? sorry , my flemish is n't all that good .
with all the coverage melanie oudin is getting , you were pretty much under the radar . this has been a surprise open for you , too . has it surprised you ? has it helped you that you have been under the radar ?
what clicked for you in this tournament that was n't there earlier in the year ?
can you talk about coming to the united states and what it 's like and how often you 're in belgium ?
when you were here you were at saddlebrook ?
what brought you here ? what sent you back ?
did you speak much english when you moved to ...
what was that whole experience like ?
what was it like going to regular class , academics ?
can you talk about the influence of kim and justine ? justine , it sounds like , had a similar story to yours in losing her mother at a young age .
when did you meet kim the first time ?
when you came to the u.s. , you came to get away from a situation and to learn how to play tennis ...
when did you decide that you wanted to be a professional tennis player ?
there 's an obvious chance that you may meet kim in the finals . has that ever crossed your mind ?
if melanie oudin wins tonight , you 're going to be facing her with the home crowd backing her 100 % . is that going to be a harder situation for you ?
how much does what you went through as a young girl with your mother , how much does that help you when you 're out on the court and you 're having a tough time ? you 've known the bigger things in life , and you 've managed through .
do you remember watching some of these wonderful matches between kim and justine ? and where were you and what were you thinking ?
who would you rather play in the semifinal ? who would you like to play ?
how would you characterize wozniacki as a player ?
what is it that 's worked so well for you during this tournament ?
have you changed your practice or your ...
when you came to the u.s. , was there something about your dad sold his business or something ?
is he here in new york ?
so what happened out there tonight ?
has the totality of what you 've been able to accomplish at this tournament sunk in yet ? if show , how transformative has that been in your career ?
your theme throughout , melanie , was `` believe . '' do you now believe even more than when you came or ...
what were you able to draw on either within you or your game to do so well here ?
did you surprise yourself at all with how strong you were mentally here ?
what are you most proud of ?
was there any chance everything you went through this week was way more than tennis , that in retrospect you might look at tonight and say , maybe it all was kind of cumulatively a little too much , you maybe were emotionally tired ? you said you were mentally fragile because of the match , but was there anything else like that going on ?
top tier athletes do have to put up with living in a fish bowl . the bigger you get , the more people analyze everything you do and everything that you say . it invades your privacy and so forth . you had just a little sampler , maybe little appetizer of what that life could be like . is that a life that you see , that you think you could be prosperous in ?
did you find that though to be a little bit offsetting , or did you find it enjoyable ?
what tournaments do you have lined up , and are you going to take any time off ?
will you play in quebec city next week ?
you said you 're a perfectionist .
do you have any concerns that you might put too much pressure or emphasis on your results as an outgrowth of this and that you 'll have to try to temper that a little ?
young girls watching you and looking up to you , they see you also as just a 17 year old girl . so what things do you do outside of tennis that help you relax ? do you like going to concerts ? movies ? what 's on your ipod ?
earlier in the year you had your first fed cup experience , which was a positive and you did very well . are you hoping to make the team in the final ? what would that mean for you ? what was that fed cup experience like ?
has mary joe talked to you at all ?
what do you think you learned about yourself or need to do to actually win a championship and compete , you know , in the finals , semifinals and finals of these grand slams ? you 've beaten a number of russian women who play the same , and bumped into caroline today and she was very consistent . what do you think you need to do to beat caroline next time ?
so you think a lot of that is going to come from experience , like you 'll just have to play through it and eventually get to those levels being mentally tough ?
a lot of people were saying , the sky is falling ; there 's no one in women 's tennis after venus and serena . it 's not so great on the men 's side , either . what do you think your incredible run here , what impact you 'll have , and are you aware of what the impact has been already ?
and the most strange , most odd thing that 's happened during this whole run that was a little surprising to you ?
we heard roger federer introduced himself to you . what was that like ?
do you think of yourself as a celebrity now ?
can you just talk about the school aspect ? i guess you take classes online . do you feel you 're missing the traditional high school experience and have friends in school and stuff like that ?
what will be your biggest memory from the 2009 us open ?
you had the chance to save the first set . you had the chance to win the second set , but you did n't . can you explain that ?
so what did you feel when you 're going to the center court , when you 're walk in corridor ? what come to your mind ?
you were too nervous ?
what positives can you take away from your performance in the tournament ? it 's hard , i know , after you 've just been defeated . can you take some positives away ?
you have got to be pretty pleased with your level overall , huh ?
so talk about playing kim . you have n't played her in six and a half years , but you played her eight times before that . you must have a decent memory of that contest ?
in a sense , the pressure is on you . because before in some of those clashes there was pressure on her to step up and show she belonged with you guys .
what does , serving up some hot damn mean ?
how do you rate your performance tonight with flavia ? especially beginning , because you made only i think four points on her serve until 5-4. then finally you won love game at 5-4. why then ?
what were your observations of kim 's match with venus ? what discussions have you had with venus , if any , about that match ?
you really think she 's faster than she was before ?
when you have your baby , what are you going to name it ?
wilson ?
what do you remember about the first time and you kim played ten years ago ?
how would you describe your relationship ? we 've heard both kim speak about you and you speak about her . what sort of feeling do you have for her ?
is it harder to play against somebody who is nice as opposed to someone who is maybe a pain in the ass ?
she said that you have a certain intensity on your face when she plays you . are you aware of your intensity out there , especially on your face ?
what do you think ?
that 's a part of the gift of your game , is n't it , that fire ?
aside from venus , in who else do you see that intensity ? in whose other faces do you see it ?
everyone here wants to talk about kim . i want to talk about flavia . how was the match tonight ? did you expect a match like that ? after you saw flavia venus four times already , were you a bit more worried than usual or not ?
going this deep in the tournament for all of the players , including yourself , does the conditioning become a major factor ?
early in the tournament , especially at the very beginning , there was a little bit of talk about no.1 and safina and things like that . well , today , as you probably know , the wta recalculated their ranking system , the ranking points , and realized that if you win here , although you will still be no.2 when the tournament ends , a week later you would be no.1 because points will fall off of her rolling total . so a week after the us open , even though both of you guys will not be playing , if you win here you could be no.1 . so what are your thoughts about that ?
there 's been a lot of talk in the last couple of days about melanie oudin 's slogan , `` believe . '' you 've had that determination since you came out on the scene . what word would you use to sum up your determination ?
did you give up about visiting brazil and speaking portuguese ? i remember ten years ago you wanted to .
if you played a great classic match against kim that was talked about for the next couple of years but you lost , could you walk away from the tournament satisfied ?
when there is a draw at the beginning of a match , do you prefer if you choose to serve or to return , and why ?
you like to be behind or forward ?
what are your observations on melanie oudin 's run here and how she 's dealt with everything ?
why is it your joy ? if you could elaborate , why has it been your joy ?
have you made a decision as to whether you 'll play fed cup ?
you said you like the us open because of the paycheck and you like the us open series because ...
most fans would think , hey , serena , she 's got millions , nike and gatorade and all that . is money still important to you ? could you talk about that a little bit ?
does n't sound at all like , you know , you carry any grudge , you know , you beat my sister so i want to beat her , at all . i 'm wondering , in the past , has that ever been a factor ? has that ever happened ? is there ever a time someone beat your sister and you said , i really want to beat her because she did that ?
you played with tremendous heart out there tonight , and the crowd really responded . it was a very electric match . i know it was n't the result that maybe you wanted , but what do you come away from that match and this tournament knowing about yourself and your heart ?
it seemed you started to get maybe a little tired in the second set . do you think the earlier match might have wore you down ?
do you think she 's above all the other players ?
what about mentally when you play against them ? is it different ?
the way she screams and grunts on the court , you heard from vera zvonareva the other night , and she has a different style . how would you compare it , and what makes serena so distinctive the way she yells out there ?
well , looking at her game , what do you think is the strategy that someone would have to take to beat her ?
do you think she has a stronger ambition for this tournament ?
looking back on this tournament or on this summer , how much are you satisfied with your performance ?
kim said earlier that when she hit with you in rosmalen that you were hitting with much more aggression than she had seen before . would you characterize that as the biggest difference in your game this past year ?
what she noticed , is that what you were specifically going for ?
on match point , it was a very long rally . did you think in your mind , well , i saved a lot of them the other night ?
you think you can qualify for the fed cup tie ?
this is your goal ?
i was reading an article in the new york times today about you and your time in new york and going to chinatown . did you see the article ?
can you describe what that experience has been like , participating in this tournament and playing so well and getting this far ? unfortunately i 'm sure you 're disappointed today , but has this been a good time for you ?
they did a good job ? it was authentic ?
are you very disappointed with today 's match ? are you very disappointed ?
are you surprised how well she 's playing , considering she 's been away from the tour for so long and just coming back ? does it surprise you that a tour player can be away , come back , and play as well as she 's playing ?
who was your favorite player when you were becoming a professional , and why was she your favorite player ?
why ? why was he your favorite player ?
you have long hair .
what are your thoughts about melanie oudin ?
was that the biggest victory of your career ?
what was the key to victory for you ?
getting towards the end of the second set , she had some chances there . what were you thinking you needed to do ?
were you thinking there were times she was playing super aggressive , then she would go off a little bit , but towards the end of the second set , were you thinking maybe i have to play a little bit more aggressive ?
so match point was a pretty big point . talk about that .
roadmap of next year just came out . copenhagen is on the map . how do you feel about that ?
most of the tournament you were under the radar . now you 're more in the spotlight . is it going to be tougher for you ?
the crowd was behind you tonight . did that feel good ?
compared to the other grand slams this year , when you lost matches earlier , what was the important thing for you coming into new york to get to this stage ?
do you feel the hard courts here are your best surface ?
how do you like stella mccartney 's outfit ?
you 're the highest seed , the only seed in your quadrant . does that make you the favorite now ?
melanie said her favorite player is justine henin . who was your idol growing up ?
i was betting you were going to the semifinal . were you ?
you both went out with maybe a potential match with bondarenko or wozniacki . did that put you under more pressure to win today ?
you were down 2-5. she also swept away a match point . did that shake your confidence at all ?
at the beginning of last week , would you have thought you could be here now in the quarterfinals ?
when you look at what oudin did here , do you take inspiration from that ?
where did you learn to speak so well english ?
in tampa with a trainer ?
why did you go there ? capriati ?
that was a mature decision . was it your decision ?
what was the reaction of your father ?
what did he do in belgium ?
you said he was a builder ?
construction ?
it was a big bet , you being nine years old , to expect you could become a tennis champion and leave everything .
how did your mother die ?
you seemed to have that right where you wanted it , and then it slipped away . how did you see it , and why did that happen , do you think ?
so you felt a huge change in her level ?
how did the crowd factor into the match ?
what was your impression of her game ?
you have had a lot of big matches in slams where things do n't go your way towards the end and you tighten up a little bit . did you get a feeling today like , it 's happening again ? does that thought go into your mind ?
if you look at her serve , it appears to be pretty vulnerable to us and people are breaking it , yet she 's winning these matches . how do you explain she 's able to do it ?
she 's now beaten four tall russians in this tournament . is there anything to that ?
pretty strong russian , though .
what will you take from this match going forward ? anything ?
it 's one thing to do it once in that stadium , but then to spend the day off , think about the next match , and think about it , do it again , are you surprised she 's been able to maintain her level despite the whole phenomenon ?
what would you say melanie oudin does best on the tennis court ?
what had you seen from observations of her previous matches , and how did it work out today in terms of her performance ?
how would you describe the accomplishment , her run here a much younger player , a much smaller player than you and the players she just played ? what are your thoughts on what she 's accomplished so far ?
how hard does she hit the ball ?
how important was that eighth game in the second set ?
how did you prepare , mentally physically , tactically ? you have n't played nadia before .
how would you describe what you 've done and how you 've done it ?
the last three people you 've played sort of are in disbelief . it 's like , well , yeah , she beat me , but i lost . i mean , are you just keeping them off balance ? are you psyching them out ? are you just playing better than they think you can play ?
could you talk just a little bit about the lob you hit , i believe to break her the first time in the third set . was your mindset offensive or defensive ? did that unfold just like you pictured it , i imagine ?
at the end of the first you looked a little lost . what was it that was n't happening ? you did n't get the serve timing down ? the forehand did n't seem to be working well , either .
were you feeling tired at all in the third set ?
is your leg impacting any of your play ?
this was the third consecutive match in which you lost the first set . what 's your mindset when that happens ? what 's your mindset been in this tournament when that happens ?
what 's the feeling when you have the crowd behind you the way the crowd was behind you ? not only the last match , but certainly today .
do you remember the fifth game of the second set ? you were ahead and you were going very well . then you whiffed . you missed an overhead altogether . things started to fall apart . was that disheartening when you did that ?
when you are down a set , does it feel like your back is against a wall and you get more intense playing ?
what would the melanie as a girl and a kid who was hitting the ball again and again and again against the garage think about melanie who is into this year 's us open quarterfinal ?
would she believe it ?
the celebrity that comes with all this , how has it been for you as each day brings more attention ?
can i just ask you something about your name ? i 'm not american , but your name is very uncommon in america . how do you pronounce it ? is it french ?
i guess people do n't pronounce it right .
you have eliminated four russians . three of them big and good . did you determine a specific weakness in all of them ?
basically you managed to crush them . the third set , that was basically something happened in third sets or with last three matches ?
do you want to see another russian next round ?
kuznetsova or wozniacki , do you have a preference or your feeling on playing one of them ?
how do you prepare ?
obviously most of the attention has been very positive , but the incident that happened at times square , was that a little bit scary ? and do you think that sometimes it 's a little crazy what the media attention , the fan attention can be ?
what were your goals entering the tournament ? and how have they changed now that you 're into the quarterfinals ?
what was the disappointing loss ?
you entered the us open not only in the women 's singles but also in doubles and mixed doubles . has it worked out well for you that you lost in the first round of the doubles tournaments ?
do you think you 'll refocus whether to enter doubles in future tournaments ?
women 's american tennis is basically the domain of the williams sisters for years . have they spoken with you or have you spoken with them about handling all this sudden fame in the last week ?
i would imagine that changing sod at your home club is a pretty tough task . how would you compare all of that with winning a match on ashe stadium ?
i wonder how you can stay so surprisingly normal in a high-pressure world of junior tennis and the stage you 're on . what have your parents done or what is it about your family , your upbringing , that allow you to be so refreshingly normal ?
with the word `` believe '' on your sneakers , what do you believe now that you maybe did n't believe at the start of this tournament ?
do you have any new beliefs though as a result of what you 've done here ?
can you be the champion ?
looking back , how important was the fed cup and everything to your season ?
who was your role model ? you 're still very young , but let 's say when you were 12 , 13 , 14 , and you were looking into becoming a professional tennis player , who was your idol or role model of all the players ?
because she 's also , i want to say you are compared to most top players not very tall , and justine is also like 5 ' 6 '' , 5 ' 7 '' .
did you attempt the one-handed backhand ever ?
the leg is still taped . are you feeling any discomfort ? what 's the status of that ?
we know the leg has bothered you for a while off and on in the summer . how did it originally get hurt ?
was there a specific turning point in the match for you ?
were you getting frustrated by her ability to return ?
seems to be a drama every time you meet her . also in miami .
are you surprised of her mental toughness ?
you were able to hit some great winners .
do you think her game plan is a little bit boring , being so defensive ?
how do you see her chances against oudin ?
you say you lost within yourself . can you put your finger on why that was ?
could you describe your feeling ?
what does this represent ? big surprise ? happiness ? you do n't believe it ?
what do you think about the score ?
i might have missed it , but was there at all a revenge factor because she beat your sister ?
did you think about it before the match ?
did she give you any tips ?
yeah .
maybe the next round will be against wickmayer . you beat her in toronto . what do you think about that ?
why do you think you can play this level in this tournament ? you are very consistent and you are very calm on the court . why ?
who do you prefer kvitova or wickmayer ?
some players like new york . some of them do n't . what about yourself ? do you like new york ?
do you have time to visit ?
what about the atmosphere , the crowd ? the stadium ?
you 're wearing a very beautiful jewel . does it bring you luck ?
is it something special ? is it a gift ?
when was that ?
did she buy it in the united states or were you already in los angeles ?
does it bring you luck ?
are you surprised by yourself , or you are not surprised ?
can you tell us something more about your matches against wickmayer ? first she beat you in fed cup , and then you had your revenge in birmingham in the final .
your only victory up till now . will it be a special match ?
what about your legs ? you have big tape . was it hurting or ...
do you have some close friends from czech , players on the tour over here ?
you know some , right ?
and you speak with them . do you know how the czech describe the situation when they beat somebody 6-love , 6-love .
they call to give somebody canary , the small bird . when that happened last time you give somebody canary , and maybe you get canary from somebody ? somebody beat you 6-0 , 6-0 ? do you remember ?
did you think about it when it was 6-0 , 5-0 ? i 'm going to win this one double bagel ?
but are you still nervous when you 're 6-0 , 5-0 up ?
more than in the previous matches ? are you getting more nervous match after match ?
you know , that you have a big draw , big possibility to go far in this draw . are you thinking about that ?
you want to see it ?
did you have a chance to talk with alona after the match ?
did she tell you what was the reaction of princess about this win ? princess was crying in cincinnati when you loss . she was very happy today , right ?
as you played so many match points in this crucial game in the second set , did it get easier ? harder ? same ? what was that like ?
do you feel like you waited until that point to bring out your most aggressive tennis ? because she was doing some dictating before that .
how did you deal with playing in the big stadium ?
so could you enjoy it the whole time , or did it make you a little bit nervous ?
outside of italy , do you feel an italian presence here maybe more than other stops on the tour ?
no , fans .
how is the popularity of women 's tennis in italy since you 're a top 10 player ?
coming into this tournament , it 's not like last year . this time you 've been playing so well , you 're top 10 , you won the big u.s. hardcourt tournament . maybe there 's expectations you that you should reach the quarterfinals . do you feel that ?
so after the tiebreaker when she starts getting very angry , did you sense that ? how did it affect you ?
but this one might have been a little different when she was taking the bandages .
i know you had a couple wins over venus , but serena is maybe at a different level .
what about the injury ? how bad is it ? or is it just something small ?
you .
so the leg was cramping ?
did to get a little bit chilly in the end ?
you 're one of the all-time favorites in new york . what was it like to hear the crowd not necessarily on your side ?
when did the arm start getting really tired ?
after melanie beat jelena jankovic in wimbledon , jelena jankovic said she does n't have many weapons and she was n't too impressed .
what are your thoughts about oudin 's game ?
what was happening from your side today ? very difficult serving . was it the arm or the toss or the motion or the sun ?
what sort of potential do you think oudin has ?
you 've been talking all summer how a comeback is a work in progress . looked pretty upset . talk about your feelings in general .
not easy to break it down . your serving , was it purely a physical thing or was it mentally , too ?
do you think she 's going to go through what you went through before you won your first major in terms of being that star on the rise ? if she is , what is that going to be like for her ?
what do you think her greatest strengths are in her game ?
you 've had many moments where crowds have been behind you , supportive . what was it like to play out there with 20,000 plus basically in melanie 's camp ?
is it a little tougher under those conditions ?
how hard is it to stop the serving problems going over into other aspects of your game ?
yes .
when you 're having trouble like you were serving , how hard is it to hold onto your groundstrokes ?
how do you think her serve will hold up when she gets up against some other tough returners ?
i 'm saying you had no problem breaking her . what is going to happen when she gets somebody who maybe holds easier than you ?
as perhaps you were at 17 , can you sense or feel when a player has a presence of mind or a real self-belief out there on the court ?
can you consider the summer a success now , or does this take a little bit out of it ?
there 's been a lot of talk about how some of the women in the game were n't mentally tough , were cracking . do you think it 's good to see a young name out there that obviously has a lot of guts ?
she obviously has game . the sport is about winning slams . do you think she has the potential to win a slam in the future ?
she said she idolizes justine henin . do you see similarities or a potential to be a player like her in oudin 's game ?
what was the injury you were battling today ? what happened ?
was it a cramp or is it an injury ?
can you talk about how this win ranks in your career highlights ?
do you take inspiration from the way flavia is playing ?
azarenka is the type of player who can hit through opponents . i thought you did a good job working angles , moving her around . what were your tactics for this match ?
can you just look ahead to the next match , if it 's li or kirilenko ?
do you like the atmosphere on the grand slam court ?
there have been a lot of big upsets on that court over the years .
you are playing extremely well right now .
could you talk about your tournament run so far ? i mean , all three matches , doing great .
is this your favorite surface , or ...
what 's caused the resurgence of your game ? i mean , it 's just absolutely , you know , all of a sudden you 're doing great . where is this coming from ?
what 's your feeling about the draw itself ? i mean , you 're kind of going under the radar . everyone is talking about the serenas and venuses , and you 're just sliding through doing great . are you happy with that somewhat out-of-the-spotlight atmosphere ?
how about your next match ?
when you played today , what was your thought going in ? i mean , you said stay aggressive . you never let her in it .
where does this rank in career victories ? how does it rank as far as the biggest wins of your career ?
is it one of the biggest wins of your career ?
it felt at times like a match that would never end .
was that one of the biggest serves of your career ?
you were facing two match points at the end . what happened right at that moment ?
the overhead . that was to get to match point .
did you have any doubt at that time that it was getting away from you ?
that you might lose at that point .
you played her once before in a three-setter , is that correct ?
was there anything you learned from having that experience before that you were able to use today ? exploit some weaknesses perhaps ?
you beat one of the top players in the world .
is there sort of a youth movement coming up now ?
are you practicing in kazakhstan ?
you moved from russia to kazakhstan , right ?
do you think she played her best today ? was there anything about her game today that she did n't have it or do you think you simply outplayed her ?
what has changed for you this year ? it seems as though you 're getting better results this year .
when did you move to kazakhstan ?
do you have ties to kazakhstan otherwise ? do you have a connection to kazakhstan before ?
you survive another day .
i mean , obviously your serve was a little bit of a problem today . what was going on with the serve ?
you played a better match today than you did in the previous round , correct ?
common sense tells you that you want to have quick , easy matches in the beginning because you save your body and so forth . can you also look at positives from being able to get through two- , three-setters in the beginning , so that as you progress down in the tournament you know you can come back and win that third set if you need to ?
you played two and a half hours two days ago , two hours fifteen minutes today . aggressive tennis . physically do you feel fine ?
when you have a day off , do you feel 100 % almost ? if you played next day you would n't be 100 % , but if you play two days later you 're almost 100 % ?
do you feel all the talk about nonsense - i wo n't even say what it is - but does the crowd or people here give you a lot of support ? people say things to you to sort of encourage you ?
your brother and many others have talked about the difficulties of living up to expectations when you are the top player in the world , man or woman . you 're no.1 by way of being , in large part , i think nine finals that you have ' been in this year . now , do you feel that that just having those -- the fact that you 've made it to nine finals on different surfaces , does that give you tremendous confidence in your ability to progress here over the course of a two-week tournament ?
as he mentioned though with all the controversy that has gone on , what was going through your mind at the end of that first set when you found yourself down a set ?
i 'm sure you love to win 6-2 , 6-1 , whatever . is there a part of you that just has to say , okay , i 'm going to have this drama . it 's going to be three sets . it 's gon na be crazy . it 's going to be double faults , but i 'll get through it . is there a part of you that has to sort of embrace it and say , let 's go ?
kim clijsters said yesterday that about the no.1 issue she said , i hope dinara is not letting it bother her or not thinking about it . i was in the same situation and i was no.1 and had n't won a grand slam . is it something that enters your mind at all ?
marat came in here and basically lectured us and said , okay , come on , guys . i got to protect my sister . ranking is ranking . leave her alone . make her happy , come on . what does it mean to you that he 's doing that ? he 's looking out for you ?
as no.1 , playing on louis armstrong , does that bother you ? do you believe you belong playing on arthur ashe ?
who is more popular in russia now , you or your brother ?
bigger than your win over jelena in wimbledon ? how do you compare them ?
can you talk about exactly what the problem is and how it might affect you going forward ?
no.4 in the world just was very gracious in describing the match and said you most definitely beat her . she did not beat herself . how does it make you feel to have a player of that stature make a comment like that about your game ?
what do you think when you saw your draw before the tournament ? what do you think about it now ?
you said you ca n't believe that you won , but before the match i think you believed you could . so why did you believe you could ?
is there something that happened this summer that sparked all of this ? why are you having such a breakout year this year ?
talk about the shoes . they say `` believe '' on them .
is that your saying or somebody 's ...
you have this specialty of taking down really good , really famous eastern european mega stars . there is a player in the drawer , i think her name is sharapova . would you like to play maria ? and secondly , at wimbledon after you won all that money , you said you 'd stick with your old toyota . are you going to stick with it now , or are you going to upgrade ?
you said you have no fear , and you went out there and you were n't supposed to win . now as people are watching you and you 're making these upsets and showing yourself that might change , how do you think you 're going to deal with that ?
between wimbledon and now , can you talk about what happened between wimbledon and now ? were you getting close to winning matches , or were you having some issues with running out of wildcards ? what was your time between wimbledon and now like for you ?
yeah .
so you were happy with how that was going ? after wimbledon you have a breakout . were you happy with the way things have led up to here ?
could you talk a bit about justine henin ? i understand she was kind of a role model for you , what you liked about her game . i assume part of that was that she is not the tallest person in the world and had great results .
how much have you been in ashe stadium in the past ?
been there as a spectator a few times ?
what was it like just walking out there ?
time and again we 've seen players on the verge of a big upset , and the moment just gets too big for them . obviously it did n't today . the last few points , what were you telling yourself , just how to stay in the moment ? what were you telling yourself ?
what did you prove to yourself today , do you think ?
are you familiar with marietta ?
would you classify yourself now as bigger than the big chicken ?
people have been writing and saying since wimbledon that you 're the next lady to move in and take the place of serena and venus . i just wonder , are you paying attention to that ? is it hard not to ? does it affect you at all ? hey , i 've got to move up and i have to do this ?
are you going to go ahead and play doubles ?
why ?
do you have an identical or fraternal ?
she plays tennis also ?
can you tell us about her a little ?
there is a certain symmetry with two 17-year olds playing two russian powerhouses in the same day . how well did do you know christina ? do you think that this will be an inspiration to her going into tonight ? do you plan on speaking with her ?
have you played her before ?
how did you do ?
and the bigness of the moment , she certainly is prepared for it . how did you overcome sort of the bigness of this place and keeping your mind so that you did n't let it overwhelm you ?
what 's your injury ? just a strained thigh or what ?
you spoke before about writing `` believe '' on your shoes . can you describe what the belief is and what it means to you ?
could you talk a little bit about your team ? what 's the strength of brian in your coaching ? is it helpful going out on tour and having a boyfriend ? does that help you out in your whole life and tennis life ?
what 's his name , first off ? have you had a chance to check your phone ? and if so , what were the texts and the messages you got since you 've walked off the court ?
did her aggressiveness give you a hard time today or did it catch you off guard ?
and when your mom went home , was she able to see your grandmother before she passed away ?
did you find out before the match or after the match ?
you found out last night or this morning ?
you had a rubber glove at one point and you were rubbing something on your leg . are you dealing with an injury ?
considering how well you 've been playing this summer , if you could , just talk about your expectations coming in and just how disappointing it is to make an early exit .
she 's playing of course in front of a new york crowd , a largely u.s. crowd . di you really feel that the feeling was that she had crowd support out there and just the atmosphere ?
she upset jelena i remember at wimbledon , and now you . what kind of future do you think she has ? not that i want to talk not about you and the others , but that 's two big wins for her .
does she have enough power ? if i remember right , jankovic was saying she was n't really doing much . i 'm the one making the mistakes .
she 's not the biggest girl in the world . do you think in this time with a lot of bigger girls around that she can hang with some of them ?
do you feel like you lost this match more than she won it , or ...
came with a good game plan ?
i think the first time she called the trainer was before your serve . i 'm wondering if that disrupted your momentum at all ?
how does that rate on your scale of best matches ?
what was the difference in the second set ? her level really dropped .
are you looking forward to the pennetta match next ?
are you happy with your career overall ?
so the injury was n't so bad that you had to take off months like sharapova did ?
but it 's completely healed and you feel 100 % ?
your strength is all back ?
you played a good match in cincinnati with caroline wozniacki and you lost it . do you think you are in better shape at the us open ?
when you play a player like mauresmo who has won grand slams and has a lot of experience and variety , how much does strategy come into play , or is it just a matter of i 'm going to play the ball on my side ?
is that sort of the same case with pennetta ?
of all the things you do n't like speaking about , how would you rate talking about your knee and injuries in general .
how do you feel in terms of your mobility today compared with your first-round match ?
how was your mobility from round 1 to round 2 ?
what was different for you in the treatment and preparation over the last 48 hours after that late-night match ?
whatever the injury is , is it a wear-and-tear kind of thing ?
is it a wear-and-tear kind of thing ? is that something that , you know , you see a lot on tour these days ?
do you feel you have the injury ? i mean , is it schedule ? is it ...
yeah . i mean , is there a rationale for whatever is going on ?
your father made some comments i guess to the newspaper yesterday that both you and your sister were hurt , and he thinks you should consider withdrawing from the tournament . what were your reactions to his comments ?
what about doubles ? you mentioned doubles in your last press conference , that you wanted to stay in the draw . still there was a commitment , but you have to think . have you thought about it any further ?
how does having an injury , or even if both of your knees are troubling you , affect your mental approach ?
where are you in that process ?
when your knee is taped up like that , how long does it take to work it in and get into the match ? does it at all hinder you when it 's taped up like that ?
when you say that , when you called the trainer in the first round , it 's because it was new , something you knew you ...
what do you know about rybarikova ?
if this were not a major , given what you 're dealing with your knees , would you be participating at this stage ?
to what degree can an injury help you focus on everything but the injury , different parts of your game ? you discussed the mental approach a little while ago . is that sometimes part of it , that injuries can make you think about the things you 're doing well ?
does the injury give you something new to prove that you can triumph over it ?
you say you 're going to focus just on the ball and you 're not going to focus on the injury . but are you focusing a little bit on your new role as one of the owners of the dolphins ?
you wo n't be involved in draft picks ?
can you give your thoughts on the wta system whereby , no matter what the result is here , if serena for example wins the tournament , she will not take over the no.1 spot . dinara will retain it . what are your thoughts on the system ?
is that your thought about how dinara has done this year to earn that no.1 ranking ?
how impressed were you with the way you were striking the ball ?
you came into net a decent amount for you . was that part of the plan overall or was it tonight you were getting balls you were comfortable with coming forward on ?
when you were sidelined a year ago , how much did you follow this tournament ? did you watch any of it ? too tough or did you want to watch ?
why did you make a point of not wanting to see any of it ?
unless i 've missed something , this was the first time frank garry has been referred to in arthur ashe stadium .
talk about beautiful , flowing buildings . what are your thoughts about his work ?
is that in malibu ?
did he follow tennis ? was he a sharapova fan ?
how would you describe your earrings ?
do you have any thoughts on your next opponent ? she 's a wild card entry , her first us open .
think back to the time you walked on the court in warsaw to now , where you were then to where you think your game is now .
you said you still feel you 're not going to be a championship contender for a grand slam until 2010 australian open ?
think back to when you were very young on your dad 's bicycle getting started at the academy in florida . that very young girl , what would she think of maria sharapova today ?
stardom was n't part of your mindset ?
was it your mom or dad who said you should be better , you want to be better than the next person ?
a lot has been said about your comeback being very good for the tour , inspiring to others . kim clijsters is back also . could you talk about what you see as things that both of you perhaps bring separately to the tour ?
how much of an issue is the shoulder for you now ? is it something you think about , something you make adjustments for , worry about ?
can you explain the new serving motion that is a little different ?
it 's been a great night for southern california tennis . are you happy you moved to southern california ?
what 's your feeling about how it went today ? tough one ?
seems like you 're fighting yourself a little bit .
what goes on in your mind after you lose the first set , it 's the first round , and you 're seeded 1 ?
how did you feel when you looked over at your coach at times in the match presumably for support , and he had very negative body language ?
do you respond more to a negative approach or a positive ?
can you talk about the battle with yourself in your mind ? how do you win that battle ?
well , when you play against yourself .
do you have any simple positive phrases that you tell yourself when things are going wrong ? are there any basic things you tell yourself that are good and encouraging ?
you had a love service game to end the match .
how did that happen ?
you 've talked about it being a dream of yours for a long time to be the no.1 player in the world , which you are , and also a dream to win a grand slam . what did you think about both of those things as this match was maybe , say , in the second set ?
you 've made so much progress in the last year and a half . how do you think the dinara two or three years ago would have dealt with the situation like this , losing the first set of your first-round match of the us open ?
are you enjoying your tennis anymore , or is just the pressure of being a top player , lead player , some days just too much ?
some other players and your countrywomen , svetlana or myskina have won grand slams , but not achieved as much as you have in the rankings . how do you rationalize that , or how do you feel about that , that discrepancy ?
you wanted to be no.1 , your great dream , and of course you 've put a lot of pressure on yourself to win the slam ; french did n't work out for you . you want it so badly . is it less fun being no.1 than you imagined before you became no.1 ? there 's so much pressure you 've put on yourself .
did you have something happen to you when you were down 0-3 in the third ?
so you remember the moment ?
tell us about it . what happened ?
can you imagine a week from saturday night lifting up that trophy , and how sweet would that be to you after all these questions , all this travail ?
a lot of observers say that sometimes when a player has a really tough scare , when she 's almost out of the tournament , sometimes that helps the player go on . do you think that could be the case in this tournament ?
what about she had a pretty standard , makeable overhead , and followed it up with two pretty standard volleys she did n't do much with . were you pretty pleased ? what you went through your head when they came back so tamely at that point ?
during the regular wta tournaments when the coach comes on court and you 're not playing well , like you lost to jankovic in the final , you yell , get upset . here he ca n't come on the court . when you look at him in the stands , can you hear him yelling a little bit in your head ?
do you have any advice from your brother inside your head ?
what do you think about your next opponent , kristina barrois ? do you know her ?
yes .
just to go back to an earlier question my colleague asked , is there one thought , one word that you can say to yourself kind of like a mantra that will calm you down ?
something that you keep repeating , like somehow i 'll be able to pull this out ?
as much as you struggled today , i mean , it seems like it 's a huge positive that you pulled this match out . it would have been easy to just give in to your emotions and give in to all that was going on . so how much of a positive do you take away from that , or does just the negatives outweigh it ?
you said that you realize she was n't as confident . what did that do for you when you realized that maybe she was nervous ?
why ?
must have been quite an experience for you .
how did it feel like after a match like that ? must be disappointed , but also encouraged ?
did it feel at times as if you were playing the no.1 player ?
at 4-2 in the third , could you see the finish line ?
have you spoken to your parents back home ?
many really experienced players who come into this room say it 's incredible to go out there on that huge stadium . you 're such a young person . can you describe what it was like out there , what you were feeling inside ?
how did you keep your from mind just racing and going to other thoughts ?
deep into the third , what were you trying to tell yourself ?
were you conscious of the big amount of pressure you were putting on the no.1 ?
do you have a different feeling about where your game is at now , having done so well against the no.1 ? doing this and putting pressure on her , seeing what the quality is of the player , does it tell you that maybe you 're farther along , gives you more encouragement ?
are you nervous now ?
you talked about putting pressure on her serve and stepping inside the baseline . when you and your coach discussed strategy , was putting pressure on her not only physically but mentally an issue ?
you were aware that she 's had a record in finals and she has n't been able to come through mentally . was that part of your mindset ?
you 've done incredibly well in this press conference and for the media here in new york .
will your success here give you more confidence for future press conferences ?
your father came from poland ? your parents came from poland ?
when did they move to melbourne ?
your dad was your coach from how long ?
you talked about being nervous toward the end . can you sense when your opponent was nervous , and did you sense whether she was ?
what 's the biggest match you 've played before today ?
do you think about that during the match when you were actually down a serve that , that people back home are watching you ?
do you have a message for your family and friends back home ?
did you start cramping up at all ?
what were you doing at this time last year ?
what 's your schedule from here until the end of the year ?
what about a preferred surface ? do you have a favorite surface ?
so many career achievements , wimbledon , career-high ranking . where would you put this first us open victory ?
during today 's match , i noticed several routine shots down the line for winners . you 're pumping your fist , yelling , come on . there were some other truly more dramatic moments where you 're almost sort of icy cold , stone face . why emotions on some shots and others that truly are dramatic you seem to be sort of in a different place ?
does it freak you out a little bit the notion that you are the third-highest ranked american woman right now ?
you and anastasia were contemporaries as juniors , but you only played once here in '07 . what was your game plan going in ? i noticed the result today was almost the exact opposite what it was a two years ago .
can you talk about your preparation in the summer ? what you 've been working on coming into this tournament ?
your dad is your coach ?
there has been a lot of talk lately about twins in tennis . obviously with patrick mcenroe and now roger with the twins . you have a twin sister .
what happened here , that you rose to this level ? she plays high school tennis ? were you rivals as young kids ?
how are you similar and how are you different ?
seemed like in that last game you kind of struggled a little bit on the first serve , and then you ended it on an ace .
how did that feel ?
have you had any preliminary conversations with ?
will be okay if suddenly venus and serena want to play , or do you feel like you 've earned the right given how you 've played this year ?
is your coach here with you at the tournament , traveling ?
what did he say to you after the match ?
any talk about what you need to do in the next match yet ? when do you have that discussion ?
how 's your leg ?
coming out of wimbledon you had a lot of additional attention that you have n't had before . are you feeling extra pressure now because you have so much attention on ?
and the viewing parties they 're having in atlanta for you now ?
talk about how you felt out there today in your match .
winning in cincinnati , i assume this has really given you a nice boost of confidence , is that right ?
what were those levels that you felt were exposed or that you thought needed extra sharpening ?
how fast are these courts compared with cincinnati or with most hard courts ? are these faster ?
you talked over the last several months you wanted to gain weight , then maybe you gained too much . do you have the weight , fitness level and strength where you want them all now ?
what did you do to lose the weight ?
safina has been struggling with this no.1 ranking and the pressure of it . we saw the same thing with ivanovic . why is it difficult , and did you struggle with that pressure ?
no.1 itself did n't pressure you ?
finishing the year no.1 is a rare accomplishment . there are other players who have n't done that who have won majors . do you ever feel it 's a little unfair or you 've been unlucky that you have n't done that as well ?
do you consider yourself maybe the best player that 's never won a major ?
as you were a girl , what 's your very first memory from tennis ?
the bubble .
did you have dreams at night when you were sleeping of playing a match in tennis ?
you have your sponsorship with anta now . can you talk a little bit about what the relationship is right now ? are you still giving a lot of input about what kind of clothes you wear ?
why are so many women having so many double-faults ? what is so hard about the toss ?
is it windy out there ?
tough one , ana ?
the forehand is usually the shot you can count on the most . you had some good looks in the tiebreaker ?
how comfortable are you with your shortened service motion ?
with a different motion on your serve , does n't that throw a different element into your toss ?
what 's difficult about the toss , anyway ? seems not to be a difficult part of the game .
is it possible you could be thinking about it too much ?
you had a very stable group around you for a while , and then a lot changed this year . along with your results , is it hard for you sometimes not to just close your eyes and say , i wish it was january 1st ? because this season has been so difficult .
you played a terrific defense , i think . you showed a lot of spirit , especially when you were going down in the third set . you were 1-4. you lost two serves . suddenly you become the underdog and you play great . is it maybe in your mind that when you 're down you 're very , very strong and suddenly you lose your mind when you are ...
is it maybe the mind fighting the instincts ?
i remember one moment you win the french open and they tell you you 're no.1 and you say , i did n't even know that . is it maybe that suddenly the mind came in and resisted to move from there and the instinct went down , maybe ?
how surprised were you though that as good as you 've been and as good as you can be that you go to the end of the us open and you look at your grand slam results this year and they 're clearly below the level that you 're capable of playing ?
with all you 've been through , do you sometimes feel older than 21 ?
about how old do you feel right now ?
that 's not so bad .
there are so many highs and lows in that match . how do you keep your emotions in check in a match like that ?
what do you tell yourself to keep them in check , anyway ?
distract yourself a little ?
so you 're going to take a long vacation or are you just going to work , work , work again ?
you have n't had a substantial break in a long time , right ? you 've been either rehabbing or practicing .
or playing .
are you looking for real estate here in new york city ?
you 've had a really great career , won a lot of titles , won the gold medal . do you ever feel any sort of kinship with dinara or jankovic that they 've been no.1 but have n't won a grand slam ? do you feel maybe it 's a little unfair or unlucky at this point ?
all three of you are in the top half . do you feel like maybe it 's your time , one of you is due ?
yesterday serena seemed more excited talking about her side businesses , writing a book . do you have any side businesses ?
there 's been a lot of talk about some of the serving on the women 's tour . you 're someone who has actually turned the corner and improved your serve . why do you think it 's a difficult stroke to master sometimes ?
have you come into new york feeling more confident , or is this about as confident as you have felt ?
how do you feel about the way you played today ? it clearly was one-sided . is this what you were looking for in your first-round match ?
do you know anything about your next opponent , melanie oudin ?
it 's been 10 years since you first came here . is there an appreciation that you have for this tournament that you gained over the years ?
is that like a mental kind of ambition of yours to try to just shut out expectations and just play and kind of let it all hang out ?
you mentioned 10 years ago , but what do you think the little girl serena williams who signed herself up for her own first tournament would think of serena williams today with all the slams , all the accolades ?
what do you think she would think of all this ?
was it something special that most parents sort of had to be in the game of tennis and know the game and culture of tennis to start teaching their kids . did your father do something outside the box by doing it a different way and in the inner city ?
the state of your game is good right now . i hope it continues . what do you attribute your success to ? training , fitness ? you look really good . are you really 100 % ready to take this tournament ?
you have this tennis thing down pretty well . i was at yankee stadium friday night . were you working on your pitching ?
that would have been a good touchdown pass .
mets are next week . maybe you can work on it again .
what compelled you to want to write an autobiography right now ? how do you think it turned out ?
was it a difficult process ? was it a lot of work ?
one of the most moving parts of the book i think to most people was really when you were kind of down , you said all the competitive bones in my body were broken , feeling kind of out of it . well , depressed . you did n't have sort of the strength of character to face it at that particular time . what were your feelings then ? how did you turn that around ?
were you pleased with the guidance you got at the time ?
you also talked about talk therapy as a guide .
you talked openly about that , which is a pretty brave thing to do .
do you find it ironic that the state of tennis in america rests in the hands of two african-american sisters ?
anything special about the jewelry you 're wearing for this tournament ?
the earrings are part of it ?
we 'll be seeing you on home shopping network ? you have appearances ?
who is your publisher . will you be doing any signings ?
what 's the name of the book ? who is the publisher ?
serena mentions the address 1117 east stockton . what kind of images ? what kind of thoughts come to your mind ?
what was it like to cuddle up on the bunk bed of your older sister at night ?
finally , what did it feel like when six of you in that van sort of went down and sort of descended on the park and sort of took it over as your own ?
i know fashion is hot for you right now , but are you still pursuing acting ?
if you were writing the story about the 2009 us open women 's draw , what would be your lead ?
when you saw the draw and you were slated to play your opponent , what went through your mind ?
but you 'd think you could go and winning this thing ?
were you nervous at all ?
how did you contain your nervousness ?
what 's the status of the fed cup situation ? are you definitely going to play ? is it up in the air ?
when the match was over , did serena offer you encouragement as a fellow -- not too many americans at this point . i do n't think many people can name players whose last name is n't williams at this point .
talk about the force of her shots , her forehand when she leans into it , and her serve ?
how does feel on your hand when she ...
i do n't have the media guide , but where is home for you ? are you in school and not playing ?
you did well , because the first set was close : 6-4. it was n't that bad . you should feel pretty good about yourself . i would . i mean , facing serena , i would feel very good .
so how will you improve it ? you said you have n't been playing the best . how would you improve your game ?
and kick some butt ?
back to the oc after this for a little rest and relaxation ?
was she doing something different out there that other opponents have n't been doing earlier in the week ? seemed like she gave you a lot more trouble than maybe the semifinals or the quarterfinals ?
did you say your legs were n't moving ?
in the first set , even her first service game , you had a breakpoint and wet to three dueces . do you feel that if you could have pulled that out it might have given you more control ? like you said yesterday , you wanted to attack and take control literally .
where does this tournament fit in your preparation for the us open ?
were you able to spend much time with your brother this weekend ? and as his career winds down , does that make the time you 're able to spend with him on the tour ...
it seems to an outsider that you guys have grown closer as your tennis has improved and as his career has reached its end . is that accurate , do you think ?
so you proved to him and earned his respect ?
obviously i 'm sure you 're disappointed at the loss . i 've seen you a lot more disappointed after a loss . is this the kind of match that you can just sort of put aside and say , ah , it just was n't my day , and it wo n't really affect you going forward ?
did you think jelena is , as they say , back in the conversation , someone that could go far and even win in new york ?
what do you mean , everyone is getting there ?
usually this time of year everyone 's tired .
following toronto , what 's the game plan for the us open schedule-wise ?
speaking of serena and venus , you 've come of age and they 've been at the top for your whole career . what do you think they 've done for the tour ? have they been responsible for more power ? are they making everyone else become more athletic and powerful ?
is that partly why you felt compelled to go to the conditioning extremes you have and pay so much attention to your diet , et cetera ?
after the match , jelena congratulated you for being no.1 so much this season . what does that mean to you ?
there 's been so much debate about who really is the best player . seemed like she took a very public opportunity to congratulate you for being no.1 .
does what whole debate about the rankings and who should be and should n't no.1 give you extra motivation for the us open ? would that quiet the doubters if you did ?
have you and jelena ever had a chance to talk about that ? because you were both in a similar situation .
but maybe you talk or laugh about it or support each other , i do n't know . have you ever had a conversation ?
how is it that you looked like the fresher player out there today ?
when 's the last time you felt this good about how you were playing ?
did you know who the people were that spelled out your name in the t-shirts in the stands ? i did n't know if they were near where your dad was .
what do you make of those people that obviously like you enough to come wearing t-shirts with your name ?
she really dominated everyone else she played this week . why were you able to almost turn the tables on her ?
was your dad a stand-in for your mom , or does he usually try to come to a few of your matches ?
that was a very sweet moment when you went over and hugged your dad .
for him , you can imagine how nervous he was for you , to be able to share that with your dad .
which was more difficult for you , with azarenka or dementieva ?
have you been in contact with your mom since the match ended ?
where is your mom now ?
with respect to playing a long match the night before and then coming back playing midday , were you looking to do anything different ? with respect to your physical condition , did you know that you had to do some things different , that you did n't have a lot of gas in the tank today ?
how long have you been waiting for a result like this ? you said at stanford you felt like you were playing well and did n't come together there .
after winning three tournaments last fall , there would be a lot of people who would think , whatever i 'm doing is right . yet you went and tried to add more muscle . what were you thinking ?
is there anything that sets this event apart for you , besides today obviously ?
your first service game , it went to deuce three times . she had a breakpoint . did you almost feel that set the tone , because if you would have lost that and then maybe it gives her confidence to be more aggressive ?
you asked for the trainer twice in the match . was it just stiffness , or beginning of the cramps ?
do you empathize with dinara because of the no.1 situation , not having won a slam ?
but do you feel a little bit more of a bond or something with her ?
how much your coach contributed to your victory today ? was it his idea to play the way you played ?
they told me he went to the bar .
yes .
you seem to keep getting stronger and better as the week goes on .
why does that happen ? why do you feel like you get so much better with each step in the tournament ?
pennetta came into this with a 15-match winning streak . did you sense her fatigue today ?
what do you do for yourself to prepare mentally and physically for tomorrow 's final ?
has the heat bothered you much this week , or do you feel very fresh yet ?
you talked about keeping the pressure on her from the very beginning , and clijsters yesterday said she felt like you did the same thing to her . how much has that become just a general game plan for you , regardless of who you 're playing ?
and no problems with your hand again ?
it 's over , it 's done , it 's better ?
have you seen your brother in town yet ?
have you had a chance to hang out much at all ?
you looked like you did n't have much left today ; is that accurate ?
this was your 11th match in 13 days , i believe . what toll , what 's the greatest toll that kind of activity takes on you ? where do you feel it the most ?
is there anything different you think you could have done ?
you said yesterday that you were hurting pretty bad , just kind of fatigued . how did you feel physically today ?
you 're in the top 10 , or you will be . can you talk about what that means to have cracked the top ?
did you get the sense that they were expecting this of you before ?
what does the last couple of weeks do for you as a player mentally ?
was this match a good barometer for you being in the top 10 now and playing the no.1 to see how far you need to still come to get to that point where dinara is ?
how did you pull that out ?
were you cramping ? i saw you bending over a lot .
looked like almost several different matches tonight . what happened in the second set ?
does this result , the way you won , make up for a lot of disappointing results you 've had ?
given your fatigue level , what did you tell yourself mentally at the end of the second set ? you got bageled , basically . how did you get back into it in the third set ?
looking at the match tomorrow , i mean , you have a very short recovery time . what do you have to do to win tomorrow ?
will you take fluids or something like that ?
how is your mother 's health right now ?
what was the difference today ? was it just you were the last person standing ? did you feel maybe more fit than dementieva ?
because it was a very tough , long match . what was the difference in the match ?
can you say what kind of sickness your mother had ?
do you feel like that person who was no.1 at the beginning of year , that that was forever ago ? i mean , there are probably people that do n't even remember that .
were you happy with the way you served ?
you said that at the end you were telling yourself that , i feel fresh , i feel fresh .
how did you convince yourself when that you body is telling you otherwise ?
in your career , would you rank this match as being one of the toughest ?
you mentioned that you have n't been playing that much this year . that has taken a little bit of that confidence . how will you see yourself looking ahead to the us open ? are you prepared for that ? are you prepared to be a grand slam champion ?
how does pulling through a tough match tonight help you tomorrow ?
during the break after wimbledon , how much did you follow the tour ?
shop ?
you had beaten her a couple times this season . how was today 's match different for you ?
seemed like you struggled on your serve a little bit . i believe you got broken seven times . can you elaborate on that ?
is this something that bothers you coming out of this match going forward , or is it easy to put behind you ?
how surprising was it for you just getting broken like that ?
was there any point where you thought you might be able to get back into it , or was it just an uphill battle the whole way ?
you 've beat elena twice in charleston and miami lately . was today a different caroline , different dementieva ?
what advice your coach give you when he came twice or three times in the match ?
did she surprise you today with something ?
after she broke you to go up 2-love in the first set , you really turned it on after that point . what happened at that point ?
what can you tell us about her game ? what did you see ? what did you expect , actually ?
were you a little bit nervous at the beginning of the match because it was her ?
you started the week pretty slowly . do you feel like you 're hitting top form now ?
we saw more variety from you today .
she made a compliment yesterday about you . she said during her break that you were the player who made the most progress , also in the sense of athleticism . do you think that made also a little bit the difference today ?
how sweet is this victory ?
did you feel a great player today ?
how do you feel about going into the semifinals ?
do you think the tournament has changed with the williams sisters both losing yesterday ?
normally you 're a crowd favorite , but today everyone loved the comeback story . did you feel the crowd may have been against you at all ?
there was a lot of double faults and breaking today .
both .
was there a lapse of concentration in the second set when you traded he breaks ?
did you feel she was nervous ?
but she had a few words to you after the match .
she said more , i think . you had a little chat .
is there anything you tell yourself mentally when the first set turns quickly ? do you say , okay , i 'm the no.1 player ? is there anything you tell yourself to stay in the match to really change it back to your side , the momentum ?
if you had to name one point or one quality that made a difference today , what would that be ?
how far do you think she can go in her comeback ?
i remember that you played the last match against justine henin before she stopped . now first match kim coming back .
first you stop the comeback story of kim .
maybe .
what were you especially pleased with today in terms of serve , footwork , volleying ? what did you really like that you did today , and what do you still want to work on to win the tournament ?
you must be very lucky girl today then , more self-assured than yesterday ?
you 'll move into the top 10 with this . has that been a goal of yours , and what does it mean to you ?
now you get to play the no.1 player . what do you think about tomorrow 's match ?
how much does it help that you are playing with this winning streak ?
yeah . is it 15 in a row now ?
what were your goals when you first started to come through ? was top 10 a main goal , or it was a grand slam ?
so what do you think the reaction will be in italy to this ?
have you spoken people at home yet ?
when will be the next time you get to go home ?
was your ankle bothering you today ?
you fell over at one stage . were you okay ?
i guess you could n't have expected such a lopsided first set , especially after she had upset serena yesterday .
what is it that she likes to do best ?
how much the match tomorrow ? you get elena . what do you expect tomorrow ?
what did you do well tonight ?
your thoughts on your win today ? seemed like you were doing really well with both your serve and service returns . you broke seven times today .
how much easier was that match than the other ones you played against her ?
you seem like you were just placing the ball really well and she was struggling on the other end . were you surprised at the difference ?
what are your thoughts of cincinnati so far in your first visit ? have you gone anywhere outside the tennis center , or just working hard practicing and playing matches ?
so if you made the semis he had to go ...
when you get this far in the tournament , how important does winning the tournament become ?
could you please evaluate caroline 's second serve ? is her second serve weak ?
she beat you twice lately in miami and charleston . did you play a little bit different strategy this time , or it was better execution of same strategy ?
are you surprised by the results of the tournament so far ? for example , the departure of the williams sisters from the tournament ?
did you think that kim clijsters can win this tournament ?
what do you think about your serve today ?
what are your thoughts on your performance and win this afternoon ?
last week you won the tournament in l.a. , and this week you 're just plowing through the draw right now . how are you feeling about your confidence ?
she was making a lot of errors . were you just trying to keep the ball in play to let her make some mistakes ?
do you approach the match any differently when you 're playing against the no.1 , 2 , or 3 , especially the williams sisters ?
you said after the match you were shaking . is that unusual for you ?
did you ever feel like you were losing the match at any point when she kept coming back , or did you feel in control the whole time ?
did you have the confidence the whole way through ?
any thoughts on the quarterfinals tomorrow ?
you gon na let this sink in a little bit ?
it seemed like you only really got going halfway through the second set . you found your form only in the middle of the second set .
is it possible to compare how she is now to how she was two years ago ?
what will you do now ? stay here for a few days or go straight to toronto ?
no .
hour and a half .
this is your first tournament back . how are you feeling ?
did you ask for a break after the second set ?
do you think kim clijsters , for the us open , she will already be a big contender for it ?
were you surprised about her level ?
when she won the us open ?
how do you feel about your match today ?
the heat really getting to you guys out there ?
are you a little more aggressive when it 's hot like this so you can get the game over ?
moving ahead , how are you feeling ?
towards the end of your match you were having trouble with your serve . you had a couple double faults . could n't put it away . what was going through your head then ?
when that happens , do you ever think that it 's opening the door for like sorana to come in ?
how are you feeling overall ?
how would you rank today 's win ? is it the best , second best , third best ?
you were nervous just because it 's her ?
but you won .
was there a stage in the match where you thought , okay , i 've got a chance , you were getting into the match ?
and you got to 5-2 and she sort of tee 'd off and hit a few winners and broke you . what were you thinking then ?
so does this kind of win mean a lot to you ?
have you had a chance to speak to kim much about being a mother on tour and the things that she 'll have to go through ?
i 've seen your daughter in indian wells two years ago , i guess . she grows up ?
does her presence help you a little bit when she 's in the stadium ?
does she enjoy the matches ?
she was very happy when you were winning .
can i ask you a few questions about your impressive match with agnieszka radwanska . was it a surprise that you beat her first set 6-0 ?
did you play with her in previous --
what was the score between you ?
and in this match , both players , you and her , had chances to break serve . you save nine breakpoints , and she saved four probably only . what do you say about her ability to finish the breakpoint ?
do you feel that you can win this tournament over here after today 's win ?
what was most difficult about playing her today ?
is it more difficult since she 's been off the tour for a while to know what to expect ?
so you had a good idea of what she ...
looked like a pretty tough match that you had to fight through out there today . was it tougher than you expected ?
how important was it that you won the first set ?
what are you expecting from azarenka tomorrow ?
you were stretching outside the player 's lounge . could you elaborate on that ? any reason ?
what would it mean to you to play deep into this tournament ?
do you remember what it was like when you were no.1 , like the type of player you were and how close you are to getting back there ?
tomorrow is just a third-round match , but it 's two top 10 players . does it feel like a big match ?
you said that monica seles was one of your idols growing up . would you like to think of yourself as a role model now that you 've risen to the top ? what advice would you give to younger aspiring tennis player ?
how can you help but put pressure on yourself , though ?
you had a pretty straightforward match today . was there anything that worked well for you or that you need to work on for your game ?
i know you played last week , but it 's been a few weeks since wimbledon . how long did it take you to recover ?
so it did n't take long at all ?
what about kim 's return here ? what do you think about that ?
what would you say to those people that say that her return is great for the women 's game because the women 's game needed a boost or savior ?
26 .
did you think the women 's game needed her to come back ? needed someone or something like that ?
how important is your play in cincinnati this week in getting you prepared and focused for the us open ?
it does n't make you feel old that kim comes back after having a baby and she 's 26 ?
i was n't out on court , but just looking at the speed of your match , looked like it went pretty easy for you .
thoughts on tomorrow 's match in terms of how big it is for you .
have you gotten more comfortable playing against highly-ranked players ? you 've had quite a bit of success against players in the top 10 this year .
say compared to earlier in your career , did you get maybe less nervous in those types of the matches than you might have before ?
is there anything you 're learning about the courts here as far as how they play ?
congratulations on your win . you came through qualifying to get into the tournament . did you feel in the first round match that you had something to prove and you wanted to show people , hey , you know , i earned my way here and i want to show what my game is like ?
looking ahead at your next match , you play elena . i have n't looked , but have you played her ?
what are you expecting out that match .
you 're playing doubles with kim .
do you have a chance to practice with her , or do you just kind of meet on the court ?
are you guys friends off the court ?
your fingernails are every other color . is that something you do for fun or superstition ?
maybe you saw serena . she had yellow ones .
how did you get out of that ?
what was happening at first ? why was it such a bad day ?
on days like this , do you wake up feeling rubbish ?
i do n't know if i missed it , what did your coach tell you down love-3 in the second set ? that 's when it turned around .
i saw a strapping on your hand . is everything okay with your hand , or is that for protection ?
what happened to the coconut ?
so now you 've been in two of the last three grand slam finals . are you ready to make it to the us open and get in a final and possibly win ?
after marat 's match last night , he had some harsh words for the critics that you have . i do n't know if you heard what he had to stay , but how do you feel about that ?
yeah .
i do n't want to repeat the words he used .
what do you say to those that criticize you ?
did you watch kim 's match last night ?
were you surprised by the result ?
two years .
your back at a tournament where you 've had success before . the fans here seem to have gotten to really know you . how important for you is it to be back at a place like this even though the tournament is on a different scale now ?
big challenge , maybe kim clijsters .
but she is belgian .
what are your thoughts on her comeback ?
how do you feel about someone that takes two years off in the prime of her career to try to pursue maybe another aspect of her life ?
you ever thought about doing that yourself ?
why not ? seems like a good reason to be done .
i do n't know if there 's any other sport , men 's or women 's , that is more of a grind for young women than professional tennis . do you or the other women on the tour think about that occasionally , man , there 's so much more to life than hitting the ball back and forth .
this used to be a tournament where you could show up and realize that you were probably gon na play pretty deep in the tournament . do you prefer it that way , knowing that you would be assured success , or this way with a better field ?
is there an advantage you have over some of the seeded players in that you 've been here so many times and they have n't ?
how much ?
it was faster before or now ?
what did you expect from kim going into that match , and did she do anything to surprise you ?
so did winning against venus help you with this match today here in cincinnati ?
do you believe she can quickly become another top 5 , top 10 player ?
did you feel like a little bit emotionally different because it was maybe more tension because it was her comeback match ?
there was a special stroke of her that surprised you that 's very good ?
that match go about as you expected it would ?
coming off of los angeles , how important is this tournament to you ?
there 's been a lot of talk about whether or not you could maybe rise up to no.1 and challenge the williams sisters for the top of the game . what do you think you still need to do to move up the charts ?
you got a lot of attention when the photos came out in june in fhm . you plan anything like that for the us open ?
do you enjoy that side of women 's tennis , being able to do stuff like that ? how much of it is a distraction and how much do you enjoy it ?
and you said you do n't have any others planned right now ?
how hard is it for you to beat your sister ? and do you think you 'll be able to cheer her up with a doubles victory later on ?
did you feel sorry at all for her because of her seeming limited mobility because of her knee problem ?
what do 11 major titles mean to you ?
you said obviously she 's the favorite two days ago because she had won all these matches and sets in a row . when you went out there , did you definitely believe you could win , and did you know what you could do against her ?
it seemed like you just kept going for the corners to open up the middle , moving her from side to side . was that the whole idea ?
we see overt emotion and fist pumps against other opponents . you 're subdued when you play against venus . is that out of being respect for being her sister ? do you have to catch yourself ?
how would you compare this run versus '02/'03 ?
do you still feel at that level ? how do you compare the feelings of those two different dominant eras ?
today when did you actually feel that you were playing against your sister ?
who gets to call your father ? because he does n't want to know , does he ? he just wants to mow the grass .
may you tell us a little bit more about that shirt . did they prepare it before and then you choose it , or they tell you afterwards and you say you like it or i do n't like it ? if you had lost , was there another shirt , or that was for your sister ?
which would have said what ?
did you get to speak to your sister privately after the final ? if not , before the doubles final will you have the opportunity to meet privately ? what will you say ? will you speak about the final ?
looking at the honors board on tv after the match , what were your feelings when you were looking at all the names and you were sort of tracking your own name ?
roger federer spoke earlier about wanting to play on for many more years . he 's regarded as the greatest men 's player . do you want to go down as the greatest women 's player ?
do you have a prediction of the outcome of tomorrow 's men 's final ?
and do you think who will win ?
what was your immediate reaction when you won the final point ? elation ? disbelief ? i got the championship back ? what were you thinking ?
you just mentioned martina and steffi and billie jean . you just stopped your sister from joining those as the only people who have won three straight wimbledon titles . does that feel strange at all ? obviously as an athlete you have to be completely ruthless and selfish . but as a sister , it must be odd to keep her out of a place among legends .
could you talk about when you were match point down against elena ? is that something you 'll reflect on down the line a little bit ? do you think you were courageous to go up to the net , or maybe lucky she did n't strike a winner ? or that 's tennis ?
what does that say about you , that you 've been able to come back from those situations ?
talking about legacy , is it more important winning more titles or what you are doing in africa with your school with young kids ?
fair or not , there have been periods when people felt like you lost your focus . do you feel like you have the hunger and the desire to maybe chase down martina 's or chrissy 's 18 ?
why do you think you are the best on big points ? how do you think you got that way ?
back to the match point . it was so contrary to the way you had been playing . did something just say inside you , i 've got to get to the net , do or die ?
how much of a motivation is it for you to try and regain the world no.1 ranking ?
does that disappoint you ?
do you see yourself as no.1 ?
how satisfying is it to have played as much as you 've played this year , perhaps more than other years , and here you are sitting holding three grand slams ? it 's kind of annoying for the other girls , is n't it really ?
we all know the slams are the key events in our sport . do you think someone somewhere should sit down and maybe tweak the ranking system a little bit so we do n't have this problem ?
with all due respect , we 're just talking about the system on paper the way the computer works . do you think that should be changed ?
can you describe the emotional and mental process you go through now in the hours after losing a final to your sister and preparing to play another one alongside your sister .
you said out on centre court it had n't sunk in that you had lost . is it beginning to now ?
the second set your serve seemed to go a little bit , in particular your second serve . was there a problem ? did you lose it a little bit or did she just attack it a little more ?
in other words , obviously your strength has been your great serve .
you were missing on first serves , and then she was going after the second serve late in the second set .
how tough was the wind ?
did you feel like you had , on that second breakpoint in the first set , that one lined up , the cross-court pass ?
do you think serena possibly benefited from the more difficult road she had to the final ?
there was n't a lot separating you . you have n't had too much time to reflect on the match . one of your strengths is really moving in on this surface . do you think you were a little bit too passive at points in the match , or she prevented you from really being as aggressive as you might have been ?
do you think you should have come in more or tried to get in more to the net ?
is it easier or harder losing to your sister as opposed to losing a final to anybody else ?
does it feel different against her than anyone else ?
you 've played on your injured left knee , and you got through six opponents with that left knee . but do you feel against a great opponent like serena you had mobility problems ?
your father was saying that the knee was a bit of a problem , whereas you were playing it down . was it a problem at any stage ? you had the strapping there .
how would you best describe serena 's performance ?
and then in the second set ?
you say you 're not a slicer . do you think that might be a useful addition to your arsenal ?
how is playing the opponent you played today different from the six previous opponents you played here ? what is it that makes her tougher than other players you faced during the tournament ?
going back to your knee . great champions get carried out on their shields . what would it have taken to stop you coming to wimbledon this last fortnight to defend your title ? amputation ?
leaving your disappointment aside , can you express your feelings about your sister taking the title this year .
you were .
you 've enjoyed so much success here at wimbledon . how can you translate that to some of the other majors ? is that a goal , to really try to get back into the finals of some of the other tournaments ?
who is first to contact your father in these situations ? because he does n't really want to know the score , does he ? is it usually the winner or the runner-up ?
is there more disbelief on your part than disappointment ? obviously you go in there and you figure you 're going to win and you 've been playing so well , winning 34 straight sets ? is it sort of like , what happened ?
what do serena 's 11 major titles signify to you ?
watching serena struggling in the semis , do you hope for her to go through to the final or do you sort of hope that you wo n't have to meet her again ?
do you ever step back and say , wow , this is pretty incredible that i 'm part of this sports story where two incredible athletes have come out of one family ?
how much pressure did you feel out there being the defending champion and having come through the tournament so impressively ?
can you put into words how disappointed you feel .
that must have been a nightmare result for you , though .
did you feel like the world no.1 out there today ?
is it the speed that you ca n't cope with on the grass ? what is the big difference ?
so next year will your preparation change ?
is there anything you wish you had done differently today , or you think you could have tried differently ?
inevitably people will ask about the ranking system again , when the no.1 loses . presumably you 're happy with the ranking system .
you 've been to three finals and you have n't won , but you have the no.1 status . venus was saying just now that it 's obviously being looked at , the ranking system . are you happy with that ? do you think it should be centered around someone who wins a slam ? should that be taken as a factor ?
is it a match you thought on merit you should have won ?
do you think this is the best match ever you have played on grass ?
talk about the last two games . at that time did you still believe you could win ?
i do n't know if you discussed the match point , but were you thinking about going down the line on the passing shot ?
apart from match point , there were two breakpoints where hawk-eye was that far away . do you believe if either of those calls had gone in your favor you would be sitting here now in the final ?
did you sense she was tiring in the second portion of the third set ?
you talk about serena being a great fighter . out there what is the key thing that you sense ? how does that translate in a point-to-point , moment-to-moment situation ?
do you feel an intensity from serena that you just do n't feel from other top players ?
how is your spirit after two successive semifinals and losing to a williams sister , getting so close ?
even more then the fact that you were more prepared and better prepared , as you said , does it not hurt even more ?
does it make you feel that you can win this title , or does it make you fear that may have been your best chance ?
is it any consolation that you 've taken part in one of the great wimbledon semifinals , longest ladies semifinals , or is your heart breaking inside ?
you cracked the serve pretty well today . you must have been pleased with that aspect of your performance .
could you tell us a little bit about how you rehabilitated the serve .
who did you primarily work with ?
i know you 've played her a lot and you know her game well . did she amaze you at times today , how well she served on big points ?
if there was one thing you could go back and change in today 's semi , what would that one thing be ?
the crowd was so much behind you . at match point in the game when it was 4-5 , it was almost as though andy murray was out there . were you conscious of that ?
what are we to make of this ? serena williams was n't playing her best tennis , which is what you said in the opening question , but yet she won . is serena williams beatable when she advances to this stage in these championships ? do you believe she is ?
do you think the media sometimes does n't give enough respect to the rest of the tour , apart from the williams sisters ?
do you have a sense you get a different serena at the slams than you get at other events , that she 's a different player four times a year ?
she seems to like playing against you . she likes the level of rallies and balls and everything .
do you enjoy playing against her ? do you enjoy that kind of challenge ? is that why you come out to the courts and play ?
you spoke beautifully the other day on how people are surprised you work to improve your game . is this kind of moment why you work ? do you still , in your heart , feel you can win a slam in addition to the gold medal ?
did you find the conditions very tough out there , the heat ?
did you find nerves got in the way because of all the people ?
you 're listed as living in london . can you tell me about london life and whether this second-week success at wimbledon has been something special to you ?
did you ever feel like you were actually ever in the game today ?
what would you say are elena 's greatest strengths as a player ?
at rome this year when you played zheng jie you came back from 5-2 down to win 7-5 , but you came off court upset saying , sometimes i go out on court and it 's like someone else playing . it was frustrating for you . do you still feel like that at times ?
sorry , not a very easy question . how is your knee ?
after the way the french open ended , what are your thoughts on the accomplishment of getting this far here ?
what are your thoughts on facing venus and the challenge that that presents for you ?
why do you think she 's so difficult on grass and how does that make for a different type of match than when you did beat her ?
another grand slam semifinal . do you feel like you 're not getting the respect you deserve ?
you had a slow start today . obviously that will be dangerous in your next match against venus , no ?
are you working specifically on the mental side of your game ?
it took marat maybe a career to sort of become comfortable and like grass . can you maybe say you 've condensed that learning curve into one tournament ?
your mother and richard williams have achieved the same thing : bringing two children to no.1 . have they ever met or compared the systems ?
have you ever compared your story to the one of the williams sisters , two siblings being so successful ?
even though you 're the no.1 , can you go into this match with really not much to lose , considering venus ' record here and her success ?
did your brother ever tell you anything about wimbledon before you 'd played here ?
were you satisfied today playing lisicki instead of the tennis player wozniacki ?
did you appreciate the fact that she came out for the last two games injured ?
how does your level of confidence right now compare with when you started the tournament ?
where did these 15 double-faults come from ?
do n't you think it 's strange that this happens mostly to the russians ? the russian girls are very strong , but kournikova was able to do 25 double-faults , dementieva 20 and even more ; you today 15. how do you explain it ?
how would you compare the mental challenge of facing somebody that maybe you 're not supposed to beat versus somebody you are supposed to beat ?
you 're now playing somebody that most people think is the favorite , venus williams . up until now you 've played many players who you 're expected to beat . how is that different for you ?
what do you mean a 50/50 match ?
it seemed like it was just hard to get anything by her . she played solid from start to finish .
what were you trying to do out there against her ?
is it difficult against venus when she 's playing that way to keep the belief that you can win ? can you just talk about the mental process of staying in the match and coming out strong in the second set .
how does that experience , playing venus , compare to matches against other girls ?
it looks like in these conditions , on that surface , that she has too much power , too much strength . is that how it feels ?
can you imagine anyone but venus and serena in the final at this point ?
is it discouraging for you to see two players that are so difficult to beat in these conditions ? do you have a sense that if you 're drawn against them , well , you 'll try and make a good show , but the idea of winning is a bit of a fantasy ?
where did you get the t-shirt ?
can you explain how the grass seems to help venus ' game , make it stronger or more difficult to play ?
is her movement a lot different on the grass than when you played her on a hard court ?
what happened with you in the third set ?
yes .
are you disappointed ?
what was the difference today between the game in australia and in wimbledon ?
when you look at a lot of the top players , does she have the same sort of aura that they have ? are you as aware of her as you are maybe of the williams sisters or some of the other great champions ?
was that the difference then : physical fitness ?
what have you learnt about yourself in this fortnight and what can you take away for next year 's wimbledon ?
what was the difference between the match yesterday against wozniacki and the game today with safina ? was it tougher today ?
second semifinal in a row . probably you will play serena . to go one round further than last year , which areas do you feel you need to be concentrating on ?
when serena is in such dominating form , what 's the mental challenge in facing her ?
can you compare your styles .
six years ago you played her here when she was no.1 . how different are you as players today versus six years ago , and how is the matchup different ?
there are many professional tennis coaches in the world , yet all the semifinalists have a parent as a coach or used to have a parent as a coach . what are the advantages ?
dinara took another coach . are there any disadvantages to having a parent as a coach ?
in the past in moscow , did you have dinara 's mother as a coach ?
for how long ?
you 've had five games so far . you have n't dropped a set . in fact , you 've only lost 20 games . obviously that 's fantastic . does part of you think that perhaps you would have liked a bigger test going into a game against probably serena ?
francesca spoke of feeling a little bit nervous . did you notice that ? how much of an advantage is it to have experience playing on the show courts ?
are you concerned about at all your second serve ? i assume it 's something you do n't want to give serena williams too many free points come thursday . that is a concern going into that match ?
people might be expecting an all-williams final . do you think we can have an all-russian final instead ?
from 12 months ago you seem to have toned up a bit more . have you added a bit more power to your game in the past 12 months ?
have you noticed an increase in the power in your game ? seems your muscle definition is that much more refined this year from last .
you played every grand slam for 12 years . are you the type of person that soaks up everything around you , or do you just do your job and go home ?
did you see the night match ?
how much did you enjoy the beijing olympics ?
you must have been feeling pretty good going into the match because of your record , but she played pretty well today , did n't she ?
did you see venus play at all while you were in the locker room ?
how , if at all , is serena 's game different on the grass than on the hard courts ?
you led 3-2 in the second set , and then what happened ?
do you think anyone can stop either of the williams sisters being in the final again ? they 've been in seven of the last eight finals here .
do you think somehow there 's different about serena and venus than the other players on the tour ?
is it a special goal - and you 've done it - to get a victory over one of the williams girls ?
is there a lot of locker room talk about them and the fact that somebody is going to have to stop them or enter the conversation with them ?
is it that they 're so good and the other women are not so good , that you have to get up to their standard ?
better is what i meant .
you 've had a good year . good run here ; good run in miami . do you see yourself in the future as a player who could win multiple grand slams ? is that something that you envision ?
there 's two parts to tennis : the mental and the physical part , the strokes and fitness and stuff . in that balance between the two , which is most powerful in someone like serena , in your mind ? is it her fighting spirit in her mind or the actual force of her shots and her athleticism ?
are you saying there 's no real weakness that you can exploit in her game ?
how did it feel under the new roof ? it was lucky for you , was n't it ?
how was to it play ? did the grass change ? the overheads ? how did the light feel ?
did the half-hour break affect you at all ?
did you enjoy the experience on centre court more once the roof was on than before ?
you are now the best in the world . there 's a lot of russian players dominating tennis . can you explain why this is ?
does your knee continue to improve ?
what do you know about sabine lisicki ?
you 're feeling confident about this tournament now ?
amlie just said that she thought that the ball was flying a little bit more once the roof was closed . did you sense any change ?
would you like wimbledon now to always have the roof closed ?
can you talk about the match today and how you felt .
what did you think of her game ? this is the first time she 's ever won a match at a grand slam .
and what was that ?
did you feel she was a little tired in the end ?
talk about venus next . you 've had some experience playing her .
how do you see that match , or what do you think you have to do to get past venus ? she 's won here five times , including the last two years .
when you play venus , do you think it 's more mentally challenging than other players ? you played venus before , and now you 're meeting here . mentally is it the same with you if it was any other player other than venus ?
what was the difference in the match , in your mind ?
talk about that drop lob combo .
did you feel like maybe you were getting a little bit tired ? that was your seventh match basically .
is it too soon to reflect on it at all ?
last round i asked you on a scale of 1 to 10 , if 1 is complete reality and 10 is a fantasy and a dream , where does this wimbledon come in ?
and how do you think this run will help you for the near future ?
so what 's your new goal for the season ? you 've accomplished one of your goals .
what do you think you 've learned about yourself , besides that you feel like you belong with these players now , this journey to the fourth round ?
this time last year you lost to laura robson . fast forward 12 months . you 're in the second week of wimbledon and she went out in the first round . is it just age that 's made the difference and made you able to compete with the older women , or is it something , some drive that you have that laura perhaps does n't have yet ?
is it simply the number of games that you 've played at that level , whatever age , or do you think you benefited from waiting till this year to really sort of attack the senior circuit ?
there are lots of social calls on young girls , et cetera . how easy is it to get from being a talented 15-year-old to being a talented 18- , 19 , 20-year-old ?
with other pulls on your time , other interests that suddenly come in as you get older .
if you went home and had a homeschool exam that started off saying , choose one word to sum up your wimbledon experience , what word would you choose ?
you said the other day most of your friends were down in the juniors . obviously you 're not going to be playing that . are you going to miss that kind of camaraderie ? it 's different obviously up here .
anybody come in today to the match , fly in for the match ?
on the set point in the first set , do you think you should have taken that as an overhead , the high backhand volley ? was that possible , or ...
what will you plan to do this evening with your parents ?
did you start to feel noise around you more as the weekend went on after you beat jankovic and so on ?
very hefty payday obviously . are you going to stick with your toyota ?
how close were you to playing in the junior wimbledon this year ?
have you even surprised yourself as to how well you played today and this week and last week ?
when you have a serve as big as yours , is it good to know you have that up your sleeve , that you can bring that out on clutch points and win easily with that serve ?
are you starting to think maybe you can go all the way now ? no reason why not with the last two results .
you 're probably the best and most exciting player to come out of germany since steffi graf . have you had any connection or messages from steffi ?
tommy haas also won . two germans in the quarterfinals . what is that going to do for tennis back in germany ?
i see your favorite book is lance armstrong 's autobiography . what is it about that book you particularly like ?
that 's what you use ?
can you develop that a bit more ? what particularly touched you ?
i believe you lost in the first round last year . was it all a bit overwhelming coming here to play wimbledon ?
do you like it now ?
boris becker is here commentating for the bbc . have you seen him at all ?
other than your serve , what would you consider the best part of your game ?
seemed to be an instant where you almost bumped at net at the changeover . what happened there ?
you were a little bit unhappy . you had a quick word with the umpire .
yes .
where did you grow up and how did you get started in tennis ?
can we hear something about your opinion about the play against wozniacki ?
horrible way to go .
did you have the problem in the first set ?
it was very hot today on centre court . i think it was 31 degrees in the shade . did the heat have anything to do with it ?
have you been given any indication yet how serious it is ?
how big a disappointment is it compared to anything else you 've endured ?
is that part of the problem , because you had n't had the best year , but you were coming back ?
will you go away from wimbledon with a positive feeling , the fact that you think , yeah , i was playing better , it was coming back ?
you said you felt you had a good chance against venus . the first set did n't show that . can you talk about that first set .
there 's been a bit of controversy about the wimbledon playing committee admitting that good looks are a factor when they choose which female tennis players play on centre court . what do you think about that ? do you think good looks should be taken into consideration about who should be on the show courts ?
do you think female tennis players should be chosen to play on centre court because of their tennis rather than what they look like ?
you 've been world no.1 and french open champion . would it have been possible to have done that if you had n't left your country at an early age to learn your tennis elsewhere ?
when you look back at that time , obviously your experience is very positive . when other people are taken away by agents who spot the talent early , are there ever any who do n't make the grade like you have ?
generally speaking on the tour .
how hard do you think it 's going to be for anyone to beat venus this week ?
do you think she 's the favorite for the title ?
can i ask you what you know about melanie ? a surprise win by her . do you know her at all ?
two american women winning at the same time , and one of them was n't named williams .
talk about today 's match . a nice revenge for australia .
does centre really feel like venus williams ' court ?
it looked like mirror images . you had your left leg all taped and she had her right leg all taped . is this for the cripple 's championship or what ?
how much was the loss in australia on your mind going into today ?
did you just lose focus a little bit at two up in the second ?
what do you remember most from the match you had against ana ivanovic here two years ago ?
and what are your thoughts on facing her now ? what have you seen in her game of late ?
have you ever stopped to look back a little bit and feel surprised by the lack of young american women coming up behind yourself and serena ?
have you got a career goal for wimbledon titles , or do you take it year by year ?
do you think about the girls ahead of you ? steffi graf has seven ; martina has nine .
federer said yesterday when talking about the second week , this is when it gets really interesting for me . do you feel the same way ?
what do you feel ? you got through the potential rough patches and now you 've got four more potential tough ones .
you started early , came out on the tour with a ton of attention , and have had a successful career . melanie is now going to be in the spotlight . what one piece of advice would you give to her ?
has she come to you for advice ?
can you afford to have a fun middle sunday , or is it going to be all business tomorrow ?
in the past you 've talked about feeling this calm during the fortnight . is that what 's happening now , or is it a little different this year ?
so everyone else weighed in on michael jackson . do you want to talk about how much you liked him as an entertainer ?
jankovic had some problems with the heat today . it clearly did n't affect you at all . is that never a factor for you ?
were you saying that you do n't strategize for any of your matches ? does this mean you do n't have a game plan ; you just go out and be venus ?
just play tennis ?
you 've won 29 straight sets here , all the way back to the third round in 2007. you were playing morigami then , down 5-3 in the third . it went over two days .
is there any explanation for why everything has been smooth since then , why you 've not lost even a set since then ?
are you surprised that ana ivanovic has dropped down the rankings so much since she won the french open last year ?
you 've had such great support from the strap on your leg . is this something that you plan to use after this tournament because it 's given you such great support ?
an artificial leg ?
you seemed to be enjoying yourself out there . do you feel particularly relaxed in this tournament so far ?
do you feel now that grass is perhaps your best surface to try and win this grand slam ?
you 're going to play mauresmo next . are you surprised to be playing her ?
are you going to keep smiling ?
this is the only major where all of the fourth round is played on one day , men and women . from a fan 's perspective , can you talk about what that must be like with so many great matches on one day .
your brother is going to be leaving the game , a wonderful character . do you think this sport will miss him ?
so someone will come up with that free spirit ? you think that will happen ?
and novak djokovic tried with his imitations , but many did n't like it . and then he stopped . did you think that was sad ?
jankovic started the year no.1 and she lost today . this time last year , ana ivanovic was no.1 . now she 's world no.13 . is there a sense that you realize your form right now could go away as quickly as it has for them , and that you have to grasp it and this is your best shot ?
jelena and ana were no.1 , and they lost that very quickly . is there a sense as world no.1 you feel your form could go as quickly as their form did and this is your best shot here ?
were you shocked jelena lost ?
of the russian players , some of you go through the russian system and some have gone through like an american system . is there any competition between people coming from this different kind of training ?
we saw svetlana go out today . obviously you 're no.1 because of your consistency . is that something you 're proud of , how week in and week out you 're really there most of the time ?
does that bother you ?
you know what you can do . but do you think you can win here ?
how do you think the match went ?
you played two chinese players in a row . what is your assessment of the way the chinese players play ?
they seem to have a very tough mentality . they refuse to be beaten . there were several times today when you were at match point and she took you all the way .
so you 've reached the second week of wimbledon again . can you assess your overall level of play ?
you 've had sort of an up-and-down year after last year . can you talk about how you feel like you 've been playing and what maybe you need to do better .
so what 's important for you in order to keep calm on court and not to feel the pressure ?
do you feel like you still have the ability of a top player ?
have you played melanie oudin at all in the juniors ? do you know who she is ?
you have to get advice from your sister on how to play her ?
you had a lot of set points there that you squandered . did that discourage you for a while ?
when we talked to you the other day , you were almost a little bit star struck . you went out and were very composed today .
not many people beat their first top 10 player their first time out . can you talk about that .
are you saying you managed to convince yourself that you were n't at wimbledon ?
did her medical break there at the end of the first set and then again for the foot , did that throw you at all ? did you have to get it out of your mind and just think about tennis ?
there 's so many great athletes who are so tall . talk about your size , your height . is that something that you use in some way as a positive ? what is your approach ?
what was your goal when you showed up here to start for qualifying ?
your coach was saying that after you won the final round of quallies he thought your confidence just locked in because you won that pretty easily . can you talk a little bit about that . it even seemed today in the third set you were pretty sure when you had a ball into your wheelhouse you were going to deliver .
at the end of the first set , what were your immediate emotions on having lost that ? if you can , give an idea of how things changed as you approached the second set .
what were you thinking as she took that extended time-out ?
would you say it was the best day of your life so far , or is that getting a bit carried away ?
another important day in your life i 'm told is when you went to the us open as a 12-year-old . did that inspire you in any way ?
memories of when you first saw this tennis tournament on tv .
did she say to chill out and be real or go for it ?
how did the family get into the tennis ? is your twin sister going to try to play collegiate ?
your dad is french ?

there 's a group of french journalists behind the americans . they 're claiming you today . you have more a french name than american name .
was the chair umpire pronouncing it correctly today ?
for the record , could you say it again .
let 's talk about grandma . she goes to the local club and says , let 's go ? was she into tennis big-time ?
what courts were those in atlanta ? what was the neighborhood ?
you said when you were younger you used to watch the williams sisters on tv .
what do you remember feeling when you were watching them , and what might you have learned from their example ?
go back to last year . you lose to robson here . now you 're in the second week of a grand slam . it 's a long way from the juniors , huh ?
on a scale from 1 to 10 , 1 is clear reality and ten is fantasy , dream , what number do we have here ?
is your family here with you ?
do you think anybody might come to see you next week ?
you seemed pretty mentally locked in . certainly more than your opponent . you mentioned speed . did you surprise yourself today , or is mental toughness something you think is a strength of yours ?
j.j. is known for a strong support team . did the , c'mon j.j.s bother you at all ?
are you aware and prepared , if a young american player shows some promise , all the focus is going to be on you back in the states in terms of u.s. tennis ?
is tennis your main strength , or are there a couple other things you 're very good at or could have been very good at ?
what other interests do you have ?
you 're quoted in one of the things i read saying your sister goes to regular high school , you were homeschooled . you missed a little bit of the high school atmosphere by not going ; is that true ?
did you visit your sister at all at school ?
what was your dream forever ? can you elaborate on that ?
who was your idol ?
why ?
and you do n't have to be russian either ?
how far away are you from getting a serve as strong as justine 's ?
that was a close one in the end again . did you feel any nerves in there when had you to finish it ?
the reason why i ask is that i remember your final against caroline wozniacki in charleston where you should finish the match and ...
what are your expectations of the match against caroline ?
how do you remember the match in charleston against caroline wozniacki ?
who is favored in the next match , as you see it ?
how would you see caroline wozniacki as a player ?
could you see your father during the match ? did you look at him much ? did you have any thoughts about him as he was there ?
but were you looking ?
both you and caroline have polish origins . do you speak polish to each other ?
and you 're good friends ?
can you tell us just how difficult conditions were for you .
do you think it was heat stroke or dehydration or what ?
have you been struggling for a few days , or is it just today ?
is that the first time your monthly cycle has affected you so dramatically like that ?
your physical condition aside , what can you say about oudin ? she 's 17 , quite young .
she 's still very young , but can you tell us what you think her potential is ?
except for her movement ?
last year serbian tennis was very much on the up with novak winning a grand slam , ana , you getting to a grand slam final , finishing the year no.1 . what has happened this year , particularly in your case ?
did injuries play a big part in your problems ?
of the disappointments you felt and the physical problems you 've had on the court , how would you compare today with all the rest ?
other problems that you 've had on the court , when you 've either had an injury or sick or had a disappointment , how would you compare today ?
was that your best match so far at wimbledon ?
when are your thoughts on facing venus williams , and what 's the biggest challenge when you do face her ?
you said you take a lot from that last time when you faced her . what do you take from it ?
adam scott has been at your last two matches . are you dating ? can you tell us about your friendship ?
that was one of your best matches this year against stosur . against venus , how much of it is going to be a mental challenge for you to see if your confidence is there to go for your shots when you need to ?
have you kept anything in reserve to be able to play venus next week ?
how important is the court to you that you play on ? you were in the new court 2. did you like it ? did it feel nice ?
how is your knee ? how has it progressed as the tournament has gone on ? no chance of making it any worse by playing here ?
when you made the coaching change back from craig to darren and to sven , was it because you were unsettled ? what was n't working with craig ? you were only with him maybe three and a half , four months .
can you describe what your thoughts are as to why there have been so many no.1s since justine henin retired .
and what are your thoughts as to whether it 's good for the tour or not so good to have one person maybe have a longer stay at no.1 ?
you were no.1 twelve months ago , and now you 're ranked 12 in the world . how would you compare your game now to what it was a year ago ?
so are you saying you 're a better player now than you were when you were the world no.1 ?
are you surprised how hard it was , how hard the struggle was , given how quickly you came up ?
are you surprised how difficult it was over the past year , given how much success you had early on ?
is there anything you can take from the male players in your game ?
what are your thoughts in general about roger federer when you watch him play , knowing that he may be setting the record for all-time majors won ?
are there any specific things that you 've changed in your play for the grass court ?
what did michael jackson mean to you personally ? would you think about dedicating today 's victory perhaps ?
did you listen to his music much ? were you a fan ?
do you have any remembrances of farrah fawcett ? did you watch charlie 's angels ?
did you know michael jackson at all ? ever meet him ?
it happened quite late last night . did you get the news last night or was it this morning ?
you were about six minutes late out to the court today . something go wrong ? could n't get out there ?
so you walked out there all on your own ?
michael jackson obviously is one of the greatest celebrities in the world culture . can you talk about the whole phenomena of celebrity , living your life as a celebrity ? is it all upside and glamour ? are there downsides ? how do you deal with that ?
are there parallels between that and you and your sister at all , in the fact that you started so young ?
your sister is scheduled to play doubles today . i 'm wondering if she 's healthy enough to do so ?
can you moonwalk ?
and two , one or two of the top players , such as yourself , who complained about being put on outside courts . are you happy with your scheduling ?
you won it two times .
is it nice to be with the more common fans ? there 's a big difference in ticket prices .
can you describe your thoughts on the many players that have been no.1 since justine henin retired , how that has affected the game ?
do you think it 's good for the game that there is this turnover at the top spot ?
a question about your twitter account . what made you do that ? do you update it yourself ? do you have fun doing it ?
can you talk about the one game in the second set , the sixth game that you lost . you kind of struggled there , double-faulted the game point .
are you a little bit in shock of the news ?
what do you think the one quality he had that just projected him to this great stardom ?
it 's also an incredibly sad day for his fans . so many people idolize you , as well . i know through your website , your blogs , you do twitter , so you are in touch with your fans . really how important are your fans to you ? how much do you appreciate the people that sleep out all night to get to see you for a few minutes ?
you were late on court . jelena jankovic was late for her match yesterday . both of you look pretty perfect on court , your hair , you outfits . does it take time you a long time to get ready ? does that affect how late you are on court sometimes ?
your father said yesterday that british tennis is in a perilous state because we do n't go to the british ghettos and nurture raw talent . do you think that 's true ?
have you ever played your sister in any other game or sport and who won ?
who won ?
people who saw you play in paris , you were n't exactly at your best there , and here you 've played maybe not today quite as well , but played impressively . how would you explain to them the serena that was there and the serena that 's here ?
when you were talking about michael jackson , his iconic status , is that a status within the black community , or is that beyond that ?
have you got one favorite song ?
nobody asked a question about facing daniela . what are your thoughts about that match , and what is the biggest challenge for you against her ?
do you feel bad beating your doubles partner today ?
she seemed to be quite comfortable , had a break in the first set , and then you reeled off five games . what was the change there , do you think ?
must be very satisfying for you to get through to the second week . you have good memories of this place . how pleased are you ?
not an easy game the next round .
do you have any thoughts on how serena is playing ?
she said she thought you were a smooth player . she would have to bring out her toughest game to take you on .
what 's happened to your voice ? do you have a cold ?
you have to face sugiyama again to team up in the doubles . are you going to say sorry when you meet her ?
we know serena is an incredible champion . she brings a certain intensity or attitude out there . do you have any thoughts about her presence on court ?
that 's part of the problem when playing her ?
it was quite noticeable watching the match today , there 's been a lot of talking about grunting , squealing . both of you hit the ball , do n't make any noise at all . what is your take on the current situation ?
do you think it 's gone too far ? do you think something needs to be done ?
this week fabrice santoro played his last match at wimbledon .
he 's playing doubles , but we 're not expecting to see him back in singles . i was wondering if you could take us back to 2005 when you won together .
any special memory from that time ? can you tell us anything about him as a player and as a man ?
he pulls off shots you wonder how he did it .
can you tell us about the knee strapping ? preventive ? something bothering you ?
what 's the problem ?
there 's nothing you aggravated , was there , the other day ?
you seemed pretty comfortable today . is that kind of match a good workout for you at this stage of a tournament ?
you said that the strap was just for support . what caused you to use it , and how did your condition change so that you did use it this time and you have n't before ?
why did you need the support when you have n't in the past ?
what sort of pain were you feeling ?
it 's nothing serious ?
larry scott gave his final press conference this morning . you were the one current player he singled out for having a leadership role , being on the player council for the whole time he 's been in charge of the wta tour . not only have you done that , but you 've actually been proactive , telling him that you wanted to be involved in gender equality . what interests you , and why are you doing that ? do you feel responsible , or are you just interested in that stuff ?
did she inspire you ? when she was the fed cup captain , did she ever talk to you about getting involved , that you were important , and that it would be good for the game ?
you did quite well in your service games today . was your serve feeling particularly good for you today ?
why is your serve so particularly good on grass ?
we often talk about the gap between you and your sister , the next generation of americans . a couple playing today , vania king and melanie oudin . can you talk about them , what you 'd like to see them do here ?
would you like to see one of them step up and do something at a major ?
obviously you and your sister are enormously loved by the people . do you like going out to the other courts for the doubles and see the more common fan ?
so you prefer the stadiums ?
bill clinton once went to watch andre agassi win the french open . would you like to invite your new president to come watch you at wimbledon sometime ?
your sister is writing scripts in her downtime . i was wondering what you get up to in your time off ? do you have a routine in london , certain restaurants , things you like to do ?
we have all these great kids in the room today . what is the thing you like most about our sport ? if you could change one thing in the sport , what would that be ?
how much longer do you think you 're going to play ?
gisela dulko told us yesterday that as well as an athlete , she is a woman , which we 've noticed , by the way . do you feel as well as athleticism and talent and dedication , there 's an important place for grace and beauty and femininity in the sport ?
you were talking about longevity . is part of the reason why some players leave early not just because of the calendar , but they do n't keep mentally refreshed ? how important is it to keep you not burned out , have some other interests , not think of tennis , tennis , tennis ?
you talked about support to your knee . this is n't about your knee , but do you think a huge part of why you 're able to play at the top so long is because of your support system ? nick bollettieri attended serena 's press conference yesterday , and he said it 's because you have the most amazing parents in the world . do you think a support system is so important ?
much has been made of your size , your length , your wingspan on this surface . i 'm wondering if there are some advantages to being short , having shorter arms , on grass ?
when you see other players that are small that are doing well on this surface , can you understand why that is ?
kirsten flipkens from belgium says she is a close friend . she says you met first time in tarbes . do you remember this moment ?
does it surprise you she got into the third round ?
did your game today go according to plan ?
svetlana kuznetsova said earlier today she was surprised you 'd been put on court 2 and she was put on court 3 , and lower ranked players on centre court . what do you think about that ?
does the court you play on matter to you ? do you think about the court ?
how was your knee today ?
is it affecting any movement ?
how comfortable are you feeling on the grass now ?
how would you explain the number of players who have been no.1 , at the top , since justine henin retired ?
what is your explanation for that many players who have had the no.1 ranking since justine retired ?
how difficult is it , do you think , to have staying power , to be able to stay at no.1 , and how does this show it ?
you have a day off tomorrow now . do you have any plans to relax , see a bit of london ?
anything particular you do to rest ? do you watch movies ?
at rosmalen last week you trained with kirsten ?
what 's the most difficult thing about grass for you ?
so you do n't try to change your game or the way you play or anything like that ?
wo n't see any slice , dropshots ?
do you feel a particular responsibility as the no.1 ? a lot of people here at wimbledon have not seen you play before . they come to the court and they 're seeing the no.1 in the world . do you feel you have a responsibility to the fans in a way ?
you 're in the third round again . you 've not got past the third round in previous wimbledons . is that perhaps playing on your mind a little bit , or are you feeling more confident this year ?
no chance you will underestimate kirsten flipkens ?
nice to get a more comfortable match than your first round ?
what is the most important thing for you to be successful in this tournament ?
is it difficult to build up your confidence after you 've had some fairly average results for such a long time ?
when you were 5-3 down in the first set ; any doubts creep in ?
in what way does sven groenefeld help you with your game ?
did you miss that at the beginning of the year ?
you said it 's important to feel comfortable . can i ask what it is you do to relax on your downtime ? what do you like to do in london ?
any good movies you watched this week ?
get you fired up ?
you mentioned darren cahill . what sort of things has he been able to bring to your game ?
why has serbia been so successful in sport in the last few years ?
did you play anything else ?
you came here last year on top of the world , french open champion , new no.1 . are you happy on court right now , or does it ever feel like the pressure got too much for you ? how did you cope in the last year ?
do you think the last year has made you a much stronger person ?
samantha stosur is your next opponent . do you know anything about her game ?
as well as you volley , do you think there might come a time , in the next year or so , where you can primarily win matches at the net ?
good start . 3-1 up in the first , you looked to be in control . what happened after that ?
are you surprised the match was on court 4 ? would you have expected a show court ?
were you completely fit ? when you went for your toilet break and came back ...
where does this rank in terms of disappointing defeats for you ?
your comments about not being bothered whether it was on a show court or not , did you sense there was a lack of partisan atmosphere on court ? there were a lot of people that wanted to see it but could n't get on court .
you said you just could n't keep it going today . do you mean that mentally after the effort of beating alona bondarenko , or was it physical , as well ?
just andy left now . he said the other day british tennis is in a pretty sorry state and must do better . do you agree ?
for the public out there , there 's nothing really for them to be excited about other than andy . you do n't agree ?
british tennis is healthy and it 's not in a sorry state ?
do you not think the british press and the british public expect way too much ? andy is seeded in the top five , so he should be getting as far as they 're expecting . as for the girls , apart from anne , nobody was ranked to get direct entry . how can girls that are only ranked between 1 and 300 in the world , how can they be expected to win wimbledon anyway ?
i 'm from a country where tennis is in a poor state , in belgium . we only have one player in the draw left . what makes kirsten flipkens so annoying to play against ?
this was a great opportunity to move into the top 100. does it worry you when you had a really great chance , your game was n't there , it was a little bit off ? does that worry you ?
was it harder to prepare , because on paper you had a very good chance of winning this game ?
was there any extra pressure from being the last girl standing among the british girls ?
the sports minister gerry sutcliffe suggested that there should be maybe be some funding cuts to british tennis because of what he said was a poor performance . what 's your reaction to that ?
by the same token , athletics , other sports , are judged by what they do in the olympics once every four years . is it not a case that when the nation 's focus is on the tennis , the people have to step up to the plate ?
you keep saying just one week , but i thought wimbledon was a two-week tournament . is n't this the problem , that we never get into the second week ? british public loves tennis . we ca n't keep saying it 's okay to do okay in the first week . how long do we have to wait before we get a british champion ?
got your g ?
are you satisfied with your game today , or could you have done more ?
so is there any room for improvement for the next one ?
were you aware before you went on court that maria sharapova had been knocked out ?
and what is your opinion on that ?
do you think people have an understanding of just how tough it is to come back from an injury and a layoff of several months , as you do ?
so what are your observations , as you see how maria has taken small steps to come back , and how tough is it to get back to a top level ?
your sister obviously is going for her third in a row here . plays grass wonderfully . you won here a couple times . analyzing the game , why do you think she 's doing so well , and why do you do so well on the hard courts ?
wimbledon is so full of rules and all that kind of stuff . maybe too many rules , a lot of people would say . the one thing i hear that 's getting on your nerves this week is there 's no eating allowed in the locker rooms . why ?
what do you do with all the bananas and kit kats that you get ?
are you allowed to drink water in the locker room ?
what happens if you feel naughty and have a kit kat anyway in the locker room ?
last year you were playing in the olympics . latest reports revealed that the air quality in the beijing olympics were two or three times worse than those in recent olympic cities . you were playing there . did you feel that the air caused you any problem ?
so you think it 's safe for athletes to go there and play there ?
did you have any trouble with the surface today ? you seemed to stumble once or twice . did n't seem too happy with the grass around the baseline .
is the surface any different from previous years ?
i 've read that venus has given you a book on script writing . will you be at the emmys or oscars next year ?
what 's the subject ? is it for tv or a movie ?
if you were writing a movie on serena williams , what would be the opening scene of that movie ?
what is the subject matter of the tv script that you 're writing ?
can i ask whether or not you 've consulted anybody that is a professional script writer that you much admire ?
do you remember when you first dreamed of holding up a championship trophy ?
a lot of other girls have reached no.1 in the world and suffered kind of a burnout . it 's not happening to you and your sister , so there 's obviously something that your father or yourself do better . what would you attribute to your longevity ?
i know for wimbledon without the williams sister is like strawberries without cream . what do you think if there were no williams sisters anymore at wimbledon ? do you think it would be less of an exciting place ?
did you have a role in designing your outfit on court ?
what do you think of roger 's outfit this year ?
do you think it 's odd sometimes with all your other interests and script writing and acting and things like that that you 're able to come here and set tremendous competitive standards ? if you were taken out of this tournament , people would be saying , where is the standard being set ? you must be proud of what you 've achieved . do you think it 's a little odd you do n't come under more pressure sometimes ?
that your position is n't challenged more consistently . we assume you will be the mark . no one has really challenged you in quite a long time .
i applaud your mom and dad , how they 've let both you and your sister be yourself . i believe that 's one of the reasons why you 're able to play tennis well and do other things well . i only wish all the parents in the world could be like your mom and dad were to both you and your sister .
can you describe your motivation to write an autobiography and what the process has been like for you ?
who was the ghost writer ?
can you comment on larry scott . he 's leaving at the end of the week . his tenure .
his tenure .
what are your thoughts ?
do you , yourself , understand what happened this afternoon ?
court playing fine , not slippery at all ?
it was playing fine , the footing was the same as normal ?
what have you learned here about how far you have to come back to your best level ?
how frustrating is it when you play a lot of tentative shots , then you play really gutsy shots on the returns when you have match point against you ? is it frustrating you ca n't do that all the time ?
to what do you attribute the serving problems you had , particularly in the third set ?
is that feeling tired or pain ?
you did a good job getting back into the match . you won seven straight games .
obviously . but midway through the third set you were love-30 , fifth game . missed a couple easy returns . there it seemed to slip . were you lacking confidence in certain shots , or did she just start playing better again ?
how close are you to getting back to the level you want to be at ? how far away from it does this match tell you you are ?
what does your summer schedule look like ?
larry scott is stepping down at the end of this month as the ceo of the tour . can you talk about what you think he 's done negative or positive during his tenure ?
in a new ceo , what are you looking for ?
will you be coming back to wimbledon next year ?
every athlete is governed by his or her body . as we know , whatever the sport , you 're like one injury away from a major problem . you were rolling along so well , and all of a sudden your shoulder goes bad . do you ever wonder , why me ? do you just say , that 's just the way it is ?
you 've always been a crowd favorite here . did you detect a groundswell of support for gisela as the underdog today ?
when you started the comeback , if we told you you were going to do not bad in warsaw , make the quarters in the french , and go out of this event with no injury , would you have been reasonably happy with that ?
can you put the injury out of your mind ? does it play on your mind when you play in matches , or are you now far enough away from the surgery to put it out of your mind ?
do you worry about it ?
you 've talked about match toughness a lot in the past , and this is four tournaments in now . just reflect on that and talk about how much it really means to be out there playing week in and week out , and how much that means to your game .
you held your nerve very well to close out that match , did n't you ?
did you think with the lack of matches she played this was a good opportunity for you ?
fourth .
you were a very popular winner with the crowd . to what extent do you think maria 's grunting or shrieking turned the crowd in your favor ?
when the game got so tense at the end , it was a terrific game at the end , did the decibels seem to go up ?
the sound of the grunting from maria , the shouting . as a spectator , i was more conscious of it . what about you ? did it begin to get on your nerves a little bit ?
it did n't bother you at all ?
you played her before her injury , obviously . did you notice much difference in her service particularly today from how it was before ?
is this the finest win of your career ? you beat navratilova here a few years ago . is this win even better ?
what happened in the second set ? you were a set and 3-love up . suddenly she came back and won six games in a row . what happened there to you ?
can you take us through your thoughts during what wound up being the last game of the match , five match points . was it tough to close it out for you ?
maria had a distinctive new jacket , military style jacket . what do you think of that ? what do you think of maria 's fashion generally ?
maria has a lot of fans , not just because she 's a great tennis player , but because she 's very attractive and she does a lot of modeling . a few people have noticed you 're not so bad looking yourself . how do you feel about being a pin up ?
would that be welcome attention , queen of sw19 ? would that be welcome , that attention ? our publication is making you the new pin up of wimbledon . would that be a welcome attention for you ?
( question translated into spanish . )
she got a time violation near the end there . did that annoy you , the fact she was trying to take her time ?
what is your football team in argentina ?
do you have a boyfriend ?
i think since sabatini , argentina is more famous for men 's players . is there pressure on you to sort of advance the women 's game in argentina ?
why do you think there 's a difference between the two ?
did the warmth of the crowd surprise you , the support of the crowd ?
happy with how you started your title defense ?
did you have a different sense of what centre court was like with the new roof there , wider aperture ?
yesterday your sister rated you as the grass court player of your generation . any comments on that ?
what does wimbledon mean for you ?
can you figure out why you do so well on grass ? obviously you won at flushing meadows , but you ca n't quite match the same thing your sister seems to do real well on the hard . of course , you just dominate here . have you ever figured that out ?
there 's a comfort level having won . do you go out there and say , here i am again , time to win ?
you took the nasty tumble there in the first game . what happened there ?
did the grass seem slick throughout ?
you said a couple of players have slipped . can you give a reason why we are seeing a few more tumbles this year ?
does it seem any different from previous times you 've been on centre court as far as the slippery conditions ?
did it affect how you played after that moment ?
what 's the fun part of playing on grass just as an athlete as compared to other surfaces ?
considering there 's seven matches to play here , it 's a two-week tournament , how much stock do you put into a first-round match ? sort of one you want to put in the bag and move on ?
can you tell us anything about your outfit this year . there 's been a lot of media attention around the way people are dressing . i was wondering if you felt any pressure on how to look out there , competing in that respect ?
when you and serena came through , i think there was a bit of an expectation there would be a generation of african american girls would become great players . it has n't happened . can you suggest why ?
your dad said when you 're here , he lets you decide what to work on in practice , whereas at other places , more his decision . what have your decisions been so far as to what to work on here ?
can i take you away from the women 's game . do you follow the men 's game ? do you have an opinion on how the men play ? do you compare the men and the women ?
do you root for any men to win ?
an american ?
is there any sort of physical or mental reason why women should n't be playing best-of-five sets like the guys ?
what is it in your level of confidence and your approach to matches here , if anything , that differs from all other places ?
do you get nervous at any grand slam ?
are you conscious of wanting to be remembered as the greatest grass court player ever ?
can you sort of sum up how you 're feeling right now .
you were so close in the final set . do you think maybe experience ...
what did you do last night ?
you did n't dream about what might happen today ?
what was your mindset coming into today ? was it completely nothing to lose , or were you starting to feel that you could win it ?
what were you listening to on the ipod ?
vera was struggling with her ankles . did you know in advance that would be a problem for her ? having seen how she struggled , coming back today , did you have a tactic to try to move her around the court ?
did you find it easier because she was ranked so far above you in world ?
but after last night , there were a lot of people out there would have hoped you could do something special today .
did you feel any of that pressure ?
taking into account where you were this time last year and where you are now , are you then confident that next year you can come back and build on this ?
you seemed to be reading something i think yesterday when you were 4-1 down at the changeover , and again today . can you tell us what that was ?
have you spoken to any of the other girls ? it 's not been the best couple of days so far .
have you followed the other results ?
'cause this was supposed to be a great chance for british women 's tennis .
what 's the biggest thing you 've learnt from this ?
did you not feel that before this match , before here ?
are we wrong to wait for laura robson to turn 18 , 21 , and win something big for britain ? are there others a bit older than her among the movers and shakers ?
was there a part of you that just thought , drat , it got dark . i know you can never know , but it did feel like you were in the ...
how do you feel the crowd helped you both last night and also today ?
where do you go from here ? what 's next ?
have you had a chance to play with laura much in the doubles yet ?
you 're playing another british pair in the doubles . might add a bit of extra spice .
you 've come really close before , but do you think wimbledon this year will be your first grand slam win ?
you mentioned after the match you have a knee injury . can you give us more details about how long that 's bothered you , what exactly the problem is ?
you 're not worried that you may have to pull out ?
she gave you a match . everybody thought it would be over in half an hour , but she gave you a match .
what did you learn most from your experience at the end of the french open ?
there were times during that match when you were looking to your coach and he was looking to you . what was going on there , and how do you try to channel that into maybe less pressure than it seemed to be during that final ?
none of us have been in that moment to win a major . when you say you have to let go , how can you let go ?
have you looked at a tape of that match ?
will you ever ?
so is your job kind of to forget it or to remember it and change it for the next time ?
if i have it right , you have a brother who is pretty good at this game . if had you to summarize in a word , what makes marat such a special guy ?
where did that come from ? was that always there , or something that he 's learned over the years ?
this is his final wimbledon . how many racquets do you think he will break this year ?
everybody is kind of waiting for you to get your first grand slam title . what , for you , would it mean to have the first grand slam title ?
about your coach , can you describe what you might have been working on with him to lessen the pressure ? it did look so tense , even in your body language , when you were communicating with him during that final .
seemed to be going so well .
did you feel it on court ? could you feel it falling apart ?
you were on court 4 today . a lot of people very close . do you think perhaps you might have been on court 1 or one of the show courts ?
are you fully fit ?
you say a disappointing grass court season . obviously is it more disappointing because everyone has seen your results over the past 12 months , and thought great . you have n't really been able to show them .
this is not an accusation , but do you feel as though you 've let a few people down today ?
did you put more pressure on yourself , do you think ?
what is your next step from here ? what are your plans for the next few weeks ? are you playing the doubles ?
the great thing about where you are in the world rankings now is you 've got big tournaments that you go into . it 's not like two years ago where maybe you had to wait around for wimbledon to have another chance .
the way the brits are going out today , it 's shaping up to be a pretty dark day for british tennis at wimbledon . do you feel sort of a collective responsibility , or are you solely focused on your own results ?
a lot of fans will look at the world of tennis and say , hey , pretty glamorous ; chance to travel the world ; play wimbledon ; pretty good money . is it a lot harder than people realize ?
in the end it 's worth it ?
given your lack of practice , were you happy with today 's performance ?
would it be fair to say you were n't at ease with yourself ?
you received some treatments after the first set . what was that for ?
how is the toenail ?
how would you assess your chances now , given the lack of practice and your form over the last six months , which by your own admittance has n't been great ?
sounded very down downbeat after eastbourne . i take it coming to the championships has rekindled your enthusiasm , one would hope ?
you mentioned recently you wanted to take a little break from tennis . are you happy to be here now ? do you want the break to be put off for at least two more weeks ?
of course , you were looking glamorous at cannes at the film festival . do you ever have days where you think you want to do something totally different , like be a movie star , not a tennis player ?
do you think women 's tennis might be more dramatic or entertaining if you played best-of-five sets ?
why is serbia having such a fantastic period in sport in so many different sports ?
but you grew up in war , your generation . you 're having so many different sports .
that looked pretty hard out there . what exactly happened at the end of the second set there ?
you seemed to be bending over .
how has your back been since had you to retire in paris ?
what did the trainer and doctor say when they came on ?
so was it an antiinflammatory or something you took at the second set break ?
so you feel it 's more like a cold coming on or something like that ?
it must be very disappointing , given it 's a few years since you played in the main draw here , is n't it ?
how special is wimbledon to you , given that great day when you beat martina hingis ? do you think of those days , how it was ?
does that hingis match feel like a lifetime away , given all that 's happened to you in the intervening years ?
when you have n't been able to follow up your successful australian campaign , is it difficult to bounce back and reestablish yourself ?
the back injury , and now what 's happened today , will fitness be a big priority for you in the time coming up ?
how hard has it been over the last couple of months to block out your father , the distractions he must bring to you ?
do you sometimes wonder what might have been if things had been different ?
what was it that brought you back from the verge of quitting then ?
top 50 still ...
how far are you off being as fit as you 'd like to be ?
it was a huge boost for australia to have you back for that fed cup match . you now look at that and think that was an unwise thing to do ?
what has been the reaction of the public to you ? what do people say to you ? do they remind you of 1999 , or what ?
how hard has it been to prepare for this wimbledon , particularly with your injuries and stuff that 's going on in your personal life ?
have you been surprised at how much interest and even affection there has been from the public over the last six months ?
i understand your reluctance to talk about your father . there has been speculation in the last couple weeks about some kind of reunion between the two of you .
where does your schedule take you next ?
are you enjoying tennis at the moment compared to your younger days ?
a word about your opponent today . she was quite athletic .
when was the last press conference when you were only asked about tennis ?
it was a long day , was n't it ?
were you aware of the fact that british players were losing all the way through or do you just keep yourself separated ?
you 've had a few close ones recently that did n't go your way . what was the key today ?
how well could you see at the end , because it was quite dark ?
how important was the crowd ?
had you rehearsed that bjorn borg-style celebration at the end ?
you have won matches here before , but is this the best win of your wimbledon career , would you say ?
33 .
the fact you had to defend your points from last year because you 're trying to get to the top 100 , you did n't want to take a step back . you might now be in us open main draw .
what are your plans for tomorrow ?
flipkens .
what do you think of your next opponent ?
she surprisingly beat szavay .
you said you were going to relax . how do you take your mind off tennis ?
have you got any family or friends with you ?
do you still live in glasgow ?
what is the biggest mental challenge of the early-round matches that at least the outsiders take for granted ?
what is it for you ? when you step on the court , what is the greatest difficulty when you face a player that everyone is thinking , well , this is serena 's match ?
the first set went in a blink of an eye . the second set was much more competitive . was that a dip in your concentration , or did she increase her game ?
how pleased generally were you with your performance today ?
is that a usual feeling for you in the early stages of a tournament ? you end up thinking , i could have played a ton better ?
you and your sister have dominated wimbledon for so many years now . dinara safina is the no.1 seed this year . wimbledon deserves the right to change the seedings . do you think you or venus should have been the no.1 seed , especially with venus defending ?
a moment ago you gave your opponent today credit for lifting her game in the second set . what is your feeling after a match about giving credit to an opponent ? as you know , different players approach that different ways . they either focus just on how they played , or they analyze how their opponent played . what is your approach when you speak to the press and you speak to others about assessing your opponent 's game ?
after the french , some said maybe you should have given more credit to your opponent who defeated you . how tough is it , after a loss , to analyze the defeat and assess credit for your opponent ?
in other matches do you sometimes think that it 's different , it is your opponent who took a match away from you ?
you talked about getting asked a new question . after years and years of press conference after press conference , what is the thing you 're most utterly fed up of talking about that you get asked ?
next question . how does it feel to play your sister ?
do you know anything about your next opponent , jarmila groth ?
used to be slovakia , but now australia .
you 've played her .
there are so many new names in the game , many not from our country . is it hard to follow who 's who ?
so are you saying you came to compton when you were seven years old from russia ?
are you happy about kim clijsters ' return ?
when you went home , did you spend any time thinking that you could have won the french open , or did you just forget about it right away ?
top three on your list of tournaments you should have won are ?
was that justine ?
what about wimbledon against maria in the final ?
is it easier when you blow a match on a tactical basis , as in , i should have served and volleyed , versus when you blow it just from a mental point and a freeze-up ?
and the reverse of that , do you think there 's any big tournament that you won and said , wow , thank you tennis gods , that was nice ?
can you assess neuza silva 's game a little bit for us ?
it was her first grand slam match , against you , on centre court . her attitude ?
the roof , you 've seen it now . what do you think of it ?
in paris you played with a lot of enthusiasm and energy . as far as your level of fitness is concerned , are we seeing maria almost a hundred percent or getting close to it ?
the other day you spoke of probably not being ready to go all the way at this particular event . how much more do you think you need to feel confident in your status right now to feel that you are ready to go all the way here ?
how much did you learn about your game and how far along you are in today 's match ?
you said in the last tournament that you were n't able to put everything into your serve . how long will it take you to get that back to normal , do you think ?
is it a matter of lack of confidence going flat out or is it just caution ?
in all that time in paris on the clay , is it a comfort to come to the grass ?
what aspect of your game are you most pleased with today ? is there something you plan on working on specifically at your next practice session ?
you were away for so long . what did you miss the most about professional tennis ? now that you 're back , what do you miss about having a normal life away from tennis ?
when a player wins as much as you have ...
anything . matches , titles . is n't it difficult at times not to focus on results ?
you played both venus and serena here on grass . can you describe the differences of their games on this surface .
but you 've played them before on this surface .
what is the difference in how their ball comes back to you ?
do you think women 's tennis could benefit from becoming best-of-five sets ? any reason why women should n't be playing best-of-five ?
what does wimbledon mean to you ? what 's so special about this tournament ?
do you feel more disappointed than pleased with yourself ?
were you really sort of going for your second serve today ?
you said a couple of things let you down . the serve was one of them , was it ?
why do you think you lost the initiative ? you were obviously in charge .
sorry .
what was going through your mind in the dressing room beforehand , just about to go out there ?
to what extent were you annoyed by her delaying tactics ? seemed to take a lot of time between points the longer the match went on .
you had to take exams last week . can you tell us what exams you were taking ?
did it have an effect on you ?
what exams were you taking ?
do you know what you 're doing next year ? are you planning on doing a levels , or are you going to focus on your tennis ?
can you tell us a bit about the difference playing a match in the main draw as opposed to last year when you were winning the juniors and playing in australia .
how much confidence does this give you to defend your junior title ?
what is the new no.2 court like to play on ?
you 've been busy lately with your studies and tennis training . what do you do to relax in your spare time , being 15 ?
do you get much time to socialize , or can it be quite hard ?
going back to the match , how did it feel playing in front of 4,000 people ? were you aware of the crowd at all ?
there 's going to be a lot of interest in you in the future . have you had a lot of sponsors knocking on your door ?
you 've obviously grown quite a lot this year , have n't you ? do you feel physically stronger as a result of that ?
you work with a dutch coach . how is it to work with him ?
does he ?
in what respect does he make you a better tennis player ?
you have n't succumbed to the grunting phenomenon at all . have your views changed on that from last year ? after you won the juniors , you said you did n't enjoy it very much , did n't like listening to it very much .
is it cheating , as martina navratilova suggested ?
gamesmanship ?
crowds on henman hill were watching your first set . do you think they can come up with a new name for you , robson ridge or something ?
any ideas ?
talking of murray mound , who is your top tip to win the men 's singles ?
he would be your man now , would he , as it were ?
in the past there 's been some controversy about the different amounts that are paid to the men 's and women 's champions . now it 's equal at wimbledon . do you think the women should play five sets instead of three ?
what do you think of her ?
what particularly impressed you about her today ?
it was a tough situation for her , but potentially a tough situation for you as well , was n't it ?
did you think she was going to beat you at one point ?
during the game ?
i wanted to ask how you felt last night ? i mean , she 's obviously never played a women 's tournament here . did you feel quite confident ? she 's only 15 .
what did you think of the atmosphere of the court ?
you seemed to be taking a lot of time between points , particularly in the third set . was that a deliberate tactic ?
can you remember what you were like as a 15-year-old ?
how do you think you would have coped with the situation at 15 , playing in a match like that ?
what age did you start to feel the pressure ?
was it strange seeing nigel up in the other player 's box ?
he was there .
have you spoken to him about laura ?
did you change your coach , larri passos ?
why did you choose him ?
how far do you think you can go ?
how are you feeling at the moment ? could you tell us something about the match ?
was it a tough match mentally and physically ?
you never lost 15 points in a row and then won at the end .
what changed , if anything , between the second and third for you ?
when you look at that trophy now , you defended it , what does it mean to you ?
why is that so significant for you ?
was there one moment in this tournament when you thought destiny was on your side and you were going to break the odd-year streak ?
you won that trophy , but who gave you that shining necklace and earrings ?
can you reveal a little bit more about the strapping , what was involved there , what you were protecting ?
how nervous were you coming in then if you already know you 're traveling with an injury ?
were you playing with pain , though ?
did you speak specifically to billie jean about the 12 grand slam titles ?
do you think today 's victory will help everyone forget the problems you had at the us open ?
how far do you think justine can go now that she 's come back to the sport ?
you 'll probably be traveling , but what are your thoughts on tomorrow night 's match with the boys ?
who 's your winner ?
perfectly clear now .
you seemed so emotional at the end of the night . did you consider climbing into the box ?
you saved at least six or seven breakpoints with your serve either with aces or winning serve . do you think the serve has been the winning key to tonight ?
aces also .
you were down 1-love and 15-40 , and you scored ace , eight , winning serve , another serve , ace nine .
did you have any green day playing in your head today like you did the other day ?
is justine 's game the same as when she left or has it changed ? is there anything that surprised you ?
like what in particular ?
difference between kim and justine ?
have you got any spare super bowl tickets ?
how are you going to celebrate tonight ?
a disappointing afternoon for you . could you give us your thoughts on the game and what did you learn from it ?
were you nervous before the game ? how did you feel before the game ?
so was it hard if she was your favorite player ? you grew up watching her on the tv , have you ?
how important do you think it 's been for chinese tennis for you and na li to be in the semifinals ?
what surprised you most about how well justine played ?
do you think she 's stronger than before ?
which points ?
what do you do now ? how do you pick yourself up ? do you watch the video ? how do you get over this ?
yes .
what kind of strategy or tactics did you prepare coming into the match ?
your coach is your husband , right ?
could you tell us like the role of your husband ? is he like a coach who is coming up with strategies or he 's supporting you or he 's your hitting partner ?
will we see you in indian wells ?
was it appropriate that you finished the match with an ace , given that your service was your strength ?
what qualities does she have ?
justine seems to be returning well .
how have you considered her comeback ?
what does it mean to you to be in this position , to be able to have another shot at the title ?
do you feel the moons are aligning ; all things are going very well ?
when do you start thinking about that game , the match ?
anytime before ?
you played singles and doubles here . physically are you feeling good ? has it flattened you at all ?
when you think about some of the great matches you 've had with justine , can you just talk about what comes to your head .
are the 2007 quarterfinals still in your head , the three in a row ?
french , wimbledon , us open .
but that was after winning here .
not over her , but you won here . what does she do particularly well ?
do you think of her as a rival or another player you have to beat ?
i think you have only defended one of your singles titles and one of your doubles titles . is it important to defend the doubles and singles titles ?
it does n't mean that much to try to defend it ?
what do you think of the chance to defend both of your titles here this weekend ?
you 're considered one of the most intense competitors out there . do you feel justine 's intensity level when you 're on the court ?
justine has talked about how the freshness she has now and the distance she took has given her the ability to get as far as she has now . you 're coming at it with momentum . how does that play into tomorrow 's final ?
justine said in her retirement it was important for her to get away from tennis , take a break , get a balance . how important do you think it is for tennis players to have a balanced life and do something different ?
do you think enough players have that balance ?
you did n't wear diamond earrings , but your sister wore gold earrings . does it have any meaning for your game ?
do you feel you have hit one forehand too many ?
have you given yourself a timeline then ?
you had a lot of sort of emotions flying in that last tiebreaker in the singles . what was going through your head ?
were you thinking of what 's ahead ?
thinking about the final , starting to get pumped .
how disappointed are you ?
not so bad ?
what was the difference between you and serena ?
but in your games . was her serve slightly different ; better than yours ? where do you think she won it ?
have you played many tiebreakers before ?
yes .
i ask that because some people say that you have to have experience in tiebreakers . so it was n't an advantage for the two sets to go to tiebreaks ?
were you tired in the second set tiebreaker ? you looked a little tired .
this was a great day for china , for you two women . where are the men ? where are the chinese men ?
it 's the question we always ask . what are they doing in china , all these men ?
there are not as many interested among the men as the women , is that correct ?
they 're not of world class . you 're a world-class player .
have you set any new goals as a result of your success here ?
did you think the crowd was on your side today ?
after they saw how hard you were fighting ?
what did you learn today from playing serena ? what was the main thing you took out of that match ?
was a woman named yu li chow ( phonetic ) a coach of yours at one point ?
in the early years ?
is this coach still around ?
will you play the fed cup ?
do you want to play ?
the frenchman is the captain ?
did you get any text messages from any important people back in china to congratulate you on your efforts here ?
including the prime minister , or not ?
what does it mean to china to have you play so well and jie zheng ? can you see tennis developing even more in china ?
was your match shown on chinese television ?
more satisfaction in beijing for the olympic games or today ?
is this the best win of your career ?
tell us , how did you find thomas hogstedt and richard sutton ? how did you start to cooperate with them ?
until last year , you were paying 60 % to your federation , and now only 12 % ; is that correct ?
it 's true or not ?
good .
could you tell us about the game ? the first set , was it a nervous first set ? how did you get back into it ?
why so many breaks of serve in the game ? there was nine in the third set . were the conditions not good for serving , or was it just a case of you putting pressure on each other ?
she was having trouble with her ball toss . were you having the same problem ?
did you think venus was still aggressive in the third set ?
with your success and jie zheng 's here as well , what do you hope for tennis in china ?
getting bigger and bigger ?
how big do you think it can become with your success here ?
do you think making the semifinal you 'll be famous when you get back home ?
did jie zheng 's win yesterday inspire you today ?
to be top 10 , the first top 10 in china , what kind of satisfaction is that for you ?
will you dream about top 5 ?
we as the world press have known for some time that china is gon na be a power in women 's tennis . you two have now got to this stage . can we expect many , many more players to be reaching the level that you 're at now in maybe the next five , ten years ?
is chinese tennis only women , or there is also some men ?
why are there no men emerging on the atp tour ?
are you flying next week to slovakia to play fed cup ?
what do you think about the power of slovak team ?
but you 're not coming maybe .
you just said you have n't been contacted ?
so it 's still possible ?
how famous are you in china ? who 's the most famous chinese sports woman ?
being down two match points in the second set against szavay , if someone told you at that time that you go all the way to semifinal beating venus , would you believe ?
this is a very difficult technical question i 'm asking you .
when did you change the color of your hair ?
when .
many times ?
why ?
you 've spoken about how you have to pay less prize money to the state federation . what are some of the other differences , advantages or disadvantages , of being on your own ?
are you good friend with jie zheng ?
very good ones ? do you go out for dinner with her ?
good friends ?
was that the one match that got away ? how would you assess your game ?
were you physically okay in the third set ? you were doing some stretches .
serena said she thought she was gone at 4-love . did you think you had her as well ?
she has such a history of these comebacks . what 's your thought process when you see a lead start to evaporate ? what 's going through your head then ?
is her presence a bit intimidating ? she 's strong and experienced as you say . does that kind of get a little bit scary sometimes ?
at 4-love , who started doing things differently , serena or yourself ?
yes . that 's why i asked you the question .
did you change your game or were you just reacting to her ? did you mentally collapse ?
were you strong enough mentally ?
is that first match at all distracting to you , not only that it went on two hours longer than at least looked like it was going to , but also it was the sister of the opponent you were facing ?
did n't change your preparation ?
serena seemed to really crank up her serve as well . by the end of the third set she was n't missing one .
what are your next tournaments ? fed cup next week ?
are you at the stage in your career where you 're happy to get deep in the second week , or are you gon na leave here thinking this one got away a little bit ?
how do you feel about making your second grand slam semifinal ; your first in australia ? must be a happy moment for you .
what was good about your game ? what did you like about your game ?
maria said you were very quick around the court , probably one of the quickest players . do you work on that or are you just naturally fast ?
you watched graf and seles when you were little to be inspired for tennis . which one did you like more ? how much tennis was shown on chinese television ?
how much tennis was shown on tennis back 15 , 18 years ago ?
you said graf is your favorite and justine is your third favorite . who is number two ?
justine is your favorite current active player on the women 's tour . you 're coming up against her . what makes her your favorite player ? and how do you think you 're going to compete against her ?
how would you say your styles differ ?
in general .
will you have to be more attacking ? kirilenko made a lot of errors in the second set . will you play your own game ?
what were the emotions when you heard henin was coming out of retirement ?
you mentioned roger federer is your most favorite male player . he watches videotapes . how do you learn about tennis ? how do you get the strategy ?
is it easy to work with your husband as a coach ?
i did n't understand . two other husbands or two other coaches ?
china is playing next week fed cup . are you playing in slovakia ? what do you think about the slovak team ?
are you enjoying the attention that goes with being a semifinalist here ?
where do you feel you came up short today ?
you played justine 15 times .
how far is she off her best , or do you think she 's at her best ?
what do you take out of the match for the rest of the year ?
you seem to be more impressed by henin than by clijsters . how do you explain that ?
you always play tight playing each other . you 've lost 13 of the 15 matches .
you sound very disappointed now , but how would you assess the start of your season ?
do you think she can win this ?
you mentioned the second serve . do you see any other new dimensions to her game ? is this just kind of justine of old or new bells and whistles ?
do you feel this is really a big lost opportunity ?
you played justine in cairo last year , brisbane , then now . do you see any progress in her game ?
these breaks that players have been taking have seemed to serve them well . you 're in good physical shape , but do you ever think just maybe mentally as much as anything you might do well ?
at the time you 're playing great , but ...
did your left leg hinder you at all at the match ? you had the trainer out there .
what makes her a tough opponent ?
is there anything you can take out of this tournament for the future , for the rest of the year ?
do you think she 's the fastest mover on the tour ? how quick is she ?
you played doubles yesterday . because of your injury now , was it a mistake ?
was it a hip , hamstring or thigh ? what was hurting ?
do you think her weakness is her serve ? coming to this match , was the main goal to attack her serve ?
you 've had a good start to the year . what are your expectations ranking-wise for this year ?
how is your right leg , and did it affect your play at all ?
where do you think you lost it today ?
has she got very solid groundstrokes ?
what do you take out of this tournament ? it 's the first one of the year and there 's a long way to go .
li has beaten you the last two occasions . what does she have that you find difficult playing against ?
so for you all grand slams are important , but what do you think australian open ?
you have n't had much success against her in the past . do you feel she was n't playing to her normal level in the first set , or did you feel you were making her play differently ?
do you feel that she 's more vulnerable now than she was in the past , that she 's not quite up there with the very top ?
she 's still capable of winning a tournament like this , do you think ?
what does it feel like to be making your first australian open appearance in the quarterfinal with another chinese player ?
why were you the better player today ?
why were you better than caroline ?
what were conditions like in the second set , particularly the serving ? there were a lot service breaks . was that due to conditions ?
did you feel the pressure ?
you beat venus at the olympics and she spoke this week about how highly she regarded playing at the olympics . how big a win was that for you , and can you remember a bit about that game ?
what do you have to do to play well against her ?
is it easy to be intimidated by the williams ' sisters when you play them ?
you balanced injuries throughout your career . i 'm just wondering about your physical state right now . is it very good ? the best it 's been ? can you tell me more ?
do you feel you 're playing the best tennis of your career right now ?
why do you think the chinese women are playing so well in the last few years ?
yeah .
when you start your career , the main goal was olympic games . after olympic games , what is the goal now for and you other chinese player ?
australian open is first grand slam of the year . obviously very important . what do you think about australian open importance to the season ?
do you feel better about the way you 're training now since you left the state sport system , the chinese tennis association ? are you training better now ?
tell us about your tattoo .
what is it ?
you kept it covered up for a long time . was it a big decision not to cover it anymore when you play ?
you mentioned after i think your last opponent in round three that you went to chinatown and you had some spicy chinese food that hurt your stomach . it tasted great , but made you a little bit sick . have you been back to the same restaurant ? what are you doing now ?
is it korean or chinese tonight ?
3-1 down in the second , 4-2 down in the second , getting a little frustrated . how did you get out of all that ?
you looked as if you were .
i think you guys know each other pretty well . played doubles together and this is the first time for you to win against her . what are the differences between this time and others ?
how important is your confidence to have won the last ten games of this match when you 're playing serena in the next match ?
do you feel like it 's a chance to make amends for last year ?
did you think the first set was of very high standard ? you were both playing very well in the first set . did you feel that playing it , that you were both playing very well ?
serena looked in awesome form today . what do you think you 'll need to do to beat her ?
how did you go with the crowd tonight ? they were making a bit of noise .
you had n't beat her in the last four times . what enabled you to win tonight ?
your current coach is the former coach of vera , right ?
do you think you took advantage of that ?
when did you start working with him ?
what is the difference between your new and old coach , do you feel ?
it was your first straight-sets win . was it your toughest ? and how did you win it ?
this is a great tournament for chinese tennis . how long do you think it will be before one of you can win a grand slam ?
yes .
is that a possibility , that you could both get that far ?
tennis is still a fairly new mainstream sport in china . do you think you 've come along very quickly ?
why do you think it 's developed so quickly ?
very strong with the women , but there are no men .
do you know why ?
do you practice just alone with your own instructor , or do you practice with other chinese players ?
do you prefer to be by yourself ?
you prefer to practice by yourself , to have yourself a career ?
you could have won the first set . you won the second set but for the loss of one game . what happened after that ?
you played her before . how is she playing this time on her comeback ?
are you more disappointed for the loss or are you happy for the great experience ?
what is the problem ? you look terrible .
there was no indication earlier ?
have you had a diagnosis insofar as how long you could be out of the game ? is it bad ?
have you managed to speak to your doctor since you came off court ?
how does this feel compared to last year when you had the back injury ?
so it 's gotten worse after you came off the court today ?
do you think you may have done more damage by playing the extra two games ?
can you travel tomorrow with your back ?
did you see kim clijsters 's comments after the match and do you feel she did n't give you enough credit that you deserved ?
did you play at that level again today , do you think ?
you 've had a lot of trouble against svetlana over the last few years . did you do something differently today ?
svetlana says this is the best she 's seen you play in a couple of years . do you agree ?
where is that composure coming from ?
you 've beaten one belgian already . you 're going to play another one . who do you expect to show up on the other side of the net on tuesday ?
can you speak about both of them ? if you play against henin , what are you going to do differently than in brisbane ?
is there a particular competition among the russian women ?
why are there so many good players ?
do you feel like you 've left some things on the table in your career that you want to achieve ?
talking about your composure before , you said you had done a lot of fitness work before this tournament . what happens in the match ? is there something different you 're saying to yourself in the match than before to keep yourself calm ?
so did you put too much pressure on yourself in the past then ?
i know you 've had some very good results before , but did you expect coming into the season that you could come to melbourne and beat kim and svetlana the way you did ?
if you meet justine , will that match have a special taste for you ?
what do you think of her return ?
you 're not surprised that justine came back , are you ? did you sort of expect it at some point ?
when she retired , did you think she was going to take some time off , but since she 's a big competitor , she 'll be back ?
after you won the second set , you got the early break , but what went wrong for you ?
so you lost a little bit of concentration after this ?
what was the key to her today ? what was her strength ?
does it irk you that it 's a grand slam and you 're not where you want to be ?
is part of that the weird scheduling , rain disruptions in the first round , late night , then the doubles ? does that play into the rhythm at all ?
you said you felt nadia played really well today . were you surprised by the level she reached ?
not the way you wanted to win , but you 'll take it ?
did you feel like before it happened you had gotten yourself into the match ?
did you notice she was struggling at all before she actually came up to the net and pulled out ?
first time in a grand slam quarterfinal . that 's a big opportunity for you .
but it 's been sort of a long process for you to get to that point .
you 've played jie zheng five times . what do you expect from her ?
how are you feeling physically ? you had some bandages .
last year was n't your best year . what is the reason now you have the success you 're having ?
i believe it 's your birthday in an hour .
what are you going to do ?
do you get to have champagne or do you not have that because you 're still in the tournament ?
can you afford to get excited and happy at this point or do you have to focus and be very serious ?
have you ever served as well as that ?
so tough a first set , but then you kind of ran away . what was the key for you ?
where were you when baghdatis retired and you found out you were going on ?
so overall , the matches score-wise have been pretty easy . i know you 've had a tough fight . you 've got to be pretty pleased with your form going into the week .
when you got here , did you feel like , i need more matches ? you did n't get that many in . i know you got some in hong kong , but you lost early in sydney .
li na again .
what did n't work for you in that match in sydney ? what do you have to do better this time ?
up to this point , you still have a chance to be no.1 after this tournament . have you ever thought about that ?
do you consider yourself a bit of an experienced player now ? because it 's not like this is your first time around .
so you do n't have the younger player 's nerves as much ?
you are pretty good friends with serena . have you been doing stuff together here in australia ?
you were a well-known personality in denmark . what are your thoughts about three-time world champion nicki pedersen ?
you 're wearing stella mccartney , which is very nice clothes . how would you describe your fashion taste off court ?
do you exchange tips with serena about fashion ?
another question about your clothes line , was there problems with your socks that fell off ?
will you be wearing those again ?
a good victory . how did you see it ?
a lot of unforced errors early . were you a little bit inpatient ?
you told us at the start of the season the expectations were strong on you . you seem to have gotten over that now .
assuming serena williams is up next . you 've won the last couple time you 've met . what do you think about that ?
anything you need to do specifically better to beat her ?
what is the mindset in that game ? is it sort of low expectations because she 's world no.1 , defending champion , or high expectations because you have the support of the crowd ?
i imagine your coach told you to stay focused at all times of the game . what did he have to say ?
the fans are pretty vocal . does that help you more , or do you feel bad if you do n't live up to the expectations ?
after your win in l.a. , serena called you a good framer . what was that all about ?
you did n't see it as a lucky win ?
two very close sets , but then you won the last set comparatively easy . can you tell us how you won the match ?
are you playing as well as you did a couple years ago when you reached the fourth round ?
but how do you assess your form ? what do you think of your form now ? are you playing as well as you can , or is there a lot of improvement to come ?
we do n't know your opponent in the fourth round yet , but if it 's caroline , you just met her in sydney . how do you see her as a player ?
what is she good at ?
last week you played against her and lost the first set , down with a break in the second , and suddenly the match turned around . do you think we 'll see a match like that , like up and down ? why is it like that ?
what would be the key of the match ?
no , this week if you play against her again .
it 's a historic day for chinese tennis here i believe making the fourth round here with jie zheng . you 've become the first two chinese players to advance to the fourth round of the same grand slam . what does this say about the development and improvement of chinese tennis ?
are you talking with zheng during this process ?
both you and jie zheng are married and have a coaching husband . so this relationship works pretty well for a woman 's tennis player ?
you had a few break chances out there today .
you were pretty proud of way you played i imagine . looked like you were starting to get a real feel for it after six weeks of full training .
you had two pretty long matches leading up . did you feel a little bit tired today as well ?
what about specifics in your game ? your serve has shown improvement at times . maybe not stepping in to the ball at the perfect times as much as you like .
what generally has it sort of given you this week ? you 've got a fair bit of tennis this week . you 've got to be happy with that ?
you mentioned venus playing the bigger points better today . is that something that as you play more tennis you hope will come back to your game , handling those moments ?
what 's it like to face venus williams ' serve ?
what 's next , casey ? have you got a schedule mapped out for the next couple months , bearing in mind that you had the injury ? have you got something planned for future tournaments ?
how will you use that protected ranking ? how do you plan to use it ?
how many do you get ?
you said you got nervous in the first couple games . has the sort of last three games done well for your confidence ?
the male choir was in good voice today . did you listen to what ...
it was the theme to jersey boys .
the last one was funny . even though venus goes ah , she ca n't be dellacqua .
in your three matches so far , you 've lost the first set . does that worry you ?
could you tell us why you won today . what part of your game really worked for you ?
what do you think about your next match ?
you made it to the fourth round here . do you think you might be able to go a bit further this year ? how are you feeling ?
you have no injuries at the moment ?
you started well , 6-1 , then the second set you were having a lot of treatment . can you tell us what happened ?
how did it affect your game ? is it movement or technique on certain shots ?
can you fix it up by the next round ?
how do you feel about the match ?
have you had a quicker grand slam match than that ? it was 57 minutes .
elena said she was overpowered . is that basically what the game was all about ?
you looked really relaxed out there . what did you do on your day off ?
did you see the movie ?
did you watch any tennis ?
are you a good cook ?
what is your signature dish ?
today 's match , what would you rate it on a scale of 1 to 10 ? improvement from the first couple of matches ?
when you walk into a bookstore in melbourne , do a lot of people recognize you ? do you like that ?
what did you think of elena 's game ?
did you expect such an easy win ?
what was it like on court ? when did you sense that she was vulnerable , beatable ?
did you feel like your game was at a high level or did you feel it was the way kim was playing ?
obviously you 're very happy with the way the tournament is going now .
do you feel you can cause some upsets ? is there that belief that you can go a bit further than what a lot of people think ?
in terms of keeping composure , sometimes in the past you 've had a chance for a big win and had trouble closing it out . did you feel nervous the last game when you had a couple match points ?
did you change anything in your preparation ?
you did n't have great results coming into this tournament , sydney and brisbane .
from your point of view , were you thinking when a player loses 6-0 , 6-1 ...
in the first set up two breaks , were you thinking that you were playing really well ?
can you explain where everything went wrong .
are you down on confidence ?
are you physically fit ? you sound a little croaky .
is it hurting you more the fact that you lost the game or the fact that you lost the game 6-0 , 6-1 ?
you were n't yourself out there at all today . you said you did n't change any preparation . is there any difference between the last match and this match ?
are you wracking your brain about why ?
have you felt like this before ?
with this game , do you burn the tape , forget it happened ?
did you feel it came in the warmup ?
a lot of us have been thinking about potential quarterfinals against justine . you talk about talking about one player at a time .
you spoke about the mental side of things . was there anything playing on your mind off court ?
was your mind there all the way ?
it was so unusual , though . no off-court distraction ?
obviously your levels of expectations raised after you won the open . did you expect to have days like this when you came back ?
you 've played a lot of matches in your career . is this about as ( indiscernible ) as you 've been at one of your own performances ?
now that you ca n't win the title here , would you like to see justine win it ?
there was some power coming back over the net today , was n't there ?
have you done any sort of calculating about what this might do to your ranking ?
where do you go now ?
must be pretty exciting to be in the third round .
starting to find your game do you think ?
who 's your next opponent ?
is it possible to let your mind wander to a possible match with serena ?
with two wins here , compare that to how you felt in perth . is it more confidence ? parts of your game are gelling ?
is it hard to go out and play doubles ? do you feel physically tired now ?
when you were a kid and playing tennis , is this the tournament you always thought about ? did you watch it and come here as a young person ?
part of the expectations that are on your shoulders , do you really feel it ? because you 're 30 in the world now . you were n't this time last year .
is it nice to have lleyton into the third round ? seems like one big happy family with the two entourages ?
obviously with nathan and giselle and everything , did you spend much time with lleyton in the summer ?
was that a fitness or hitting session ?
is it your serve that 's the problem with your game ?
seems like it 's been the same story : you fight , try to improve , and you get in these matches and you 're falling a little bit short .
what part of the actual serve are you trying to change or improve on ?
in some of the key moments , it seems like you 're lacking confidence .
if someone asked you about your game in 2008 and 2010 , what would you say ? why were you no.1 and playing french open final , and now second round out ?
why were you lacking fitness last year ?
when you took three months off at the end of last year , how did you spend that time ?
you say that was part of sport , recapturing glory when everything is going well , and you 're challenged by form and fitness .
have you spoken to adam about that ? you both had similar years that just escaped you at times .
what do you do this year to give yourself a break when you 're away from tennis ? how do you unwind and relax ? is there something different in your routine this year ?
are you able to play from instinct , or are you thinking too much on court ?
you said the ball toss is a problem for you . what is the difficulty for you ?
you talked about playing with instinct . when was the last time you think you were playing with pure instinct and not thinking ?
is it still fun , or are there days when it 's stressful and you feel like you 're suffering ?
you must be pretty thrilled with that .
could you imagine back in october being here now ? it has to be beyond your wildest dreams almost .
your service in the first set was obviously a lot better than yesterday .
did nerves have anything to do with the prince watching in the stands ?
why did n't you ?
have you got the right mindset now to take on venus with a game like you 've got now ? you 've grown a bit over the last couple of years and you had a pretty good 2008 series here . are you in the right mindset to take on that challenge there ?
how do you handle the power of someone like venus ? do you have to try and match it or step up the pace of your own shots ?
do you draw on the experience of a couple years ago , the big matches you won ?
does that belief give you a genuine chance to beat venus ?
are you ready to start playing fed cup again ?
obviously means a lot to you to play for your country . you 've enjoyed the experience before . are you sort of putting your hand up now and saying you 're ready to go ?
you sort of had some pretty long matches in the last few weeks , including this week . i suppose that will help you feel physically ready , too .
what was going through your mind when more and more of those match points tonight started to slip away ?
you talked about how you love playing here and the crowd support . are there any downsides to playing in australia with all the media attention and expectations ?
is there a chance nan will hop on a plane and be at the next match ?
you must have been happy with your game today . could you tell us about it .
does it feel different coming to this grand slam after making the final of the u.s. and your ranking is up to 4 ? do you feel more expectation from outside ?
are you working with darren cahill at all , or is your dad still your main coach ?
you 're playing the german girl next .
what do you think about her ?
do you know her from your time together on the tour ?
are you surprised to be as advanced with your tennis at this age , or were you expecting to do this well so early ?
any areas of improvement , any particular areas , that you need to get better at , do you think ?
after the ban you had overturned at the end of last year , do you feel like you 've been sort of unfairly stained by what was associated with you and your name ?
did you feel like you had a point to prove , given that the tournament organizers would n't give you a wild card , they made you play qualifiers ?
why did you improve so much last year ?
the comeback of clijsters and henin , what is your relationship with them ?
you played flavia in auckland a few weeks back . tell us the difference between that match and this match .
what do you make of your performance today out there ?
so what do you think you need to improve moving forward ?
do you know anything about your next opponent ?
what sort of match do you expect ?
how have you spent the off-season ?
could you take us through the match today . you seemed fairly comfortable out there . fairly impressive win .
how do you rate your form at the moment ? you went out early in auckland , but you looked pretty good out there today . how are you feeling about yourself .
your next opponent is szavay . how do you prepare for that ?
confident going into that match ?
can you talk about this coming year . what are your goals for this year ? what would you like to achieve ?
give us a summary of how you felt about how it went .
you 're remarkably consistent in early rounds of grand slams . is there a reason or reasons for that , or is it just coincidence ?
preparation , lead-up , early loss in sydney . do you feel as well-prepared as you were last year ?
what sort of thing are you working on ? technique ? movement ?
adding aggression to your game , is that just something you decided to do ? was it advice from anyone ?
will you play against serbia in fed cup ?
do you know who is going to play ?
there 's quite a big break between your first and second grand slams . just tell us how important it was to get that breakthrough win last year after five years , and how it sets up your preparations here .
did you expect a tougher match today ?
i noticed you did a bit of juggling on the court during the match . have you ever considered and alternative career in soccer ?
how disappointing a loss is that ?
were you really crossed when you saw your draw , saw what bad luck it was to have to face justine in the second round ?
how did you find her on the court today ?
did you feel like she was playing the same as the last time you played her ?
you had a chance to get back into the match late , a few chances . in the tiebreak , you perhaps picked a shot which was n't the best choice . it was a volley which hit the net . would you play that shot again if you had the chance ?
is she in a way maybe a little bit intimidating in the way she puts pressure on you ?
after the disappointment , what could you learn from her or this game ?
do you like your nickname , aussie kim ?
you have to be proud from the things you did in brisbane when you visited the hospital for the kids . who made you such a sensitive person ?
yes .
was that jada there watching today ?
how did jada handle such a long trip ? how was she ?
how is your level out there ? bit of a hole in the second set . how do you feel like you 're striking the ball ?
is that where you like to be , playing at a level to beat your opponents , but knowing you have some extra gears in there ?
are you looking forward to the clash in fed cup , which is next weekend , in poland ?
that 's why i was crying when you gave the prize money . that 's how polish people are .
no . there 's sensitive people in the world .
so how about radwanska , the polish girls ?
you next play petrova . what are your thoughts on that game ?
this is your second grand slam tournament after your comeback . how do you feel different here than you did at the us open now that you 're like one of the favorites ?
situation recently with a player who was approached to fix a match , was fined , suspended for not supporting it . are the rules clear to you what you 're supposed to report if something like that happens ?
how you feeling ?
the first three net cords trickling over , did you think someone up there loved you today ?
how much difficulty did you have with the sun because you were not happy at all ?
apart from the dip in the second start , were you surprised you maintained that level of consistency throughout the match ?
mentally in the second set when you thought you had the chance to be serving for it , to lose it , then to get it back again , you 're digging into what ? bad experiences in the past ? confidence you 're taking from this year ?
possibility of dinara safina .
you said after the first game , the cramps were from tension . was there no tension today when you went on court ?
speaking of the heat , it was warm out there . what else have you been doing to prepare for the heat coming this week ?
a lot of crowd support out there . does that help in a foreign grand slam ?
you converted 6 of your 11 breakpoint opportunities today . is that a concern ?
in terms of getting the job done , where does that rate in terms of getting results , having a specific job to do and doing it ?
talk about the relief of getting through today .
had there been a point in the last week where people started to get to you a bit , people saying you were crumbling , ca n't handle the pressure ? did that get difficult at any point ?
what was most pleasing about your form today then ?
olivia rogowska just got on court . the younger players coming through , what are our prospects as a country for having some more top 50 players in the next three years or so ?
your next round ...
neither of them are big names . what are you expecting ?
does that lift a little bit off your shoulders ? you got through one , you can relax a little bit now ?
your opponent said her target this year is to play more on the wta circuit instead of the itf . to achieve this goal , what part of her game do you think needs most improvement ?
no doubt you enjoyed a lot of crowd support . how much do you find that impacts on your game ?
what 's the big difference in being no.13 compared to where you 've been before ?
would you say there 's more pressure for you now ?
it 's very interesting that after i come to melbourne this year , i can see you everywhere , tram stops , television commercials . can you talk about being no.1 , more doors of opportunity for you ?
do you sympathize with jelena at all at the moment ? she 's going through a tough time again .
do you have any sort of advice for her , how to recover ?
must feel like a good job done .
a lot of breaks in the second set . did you start to question ...
a victory on foreign soil in a grand slam , how gratifying is that for you ?
have you worked on your consistency more and more ?
this time last year your message kind of was , i know what to do now , i know which way to go . what has happened in the last 12 months ? we know the ranking has got better . you were in south africa just before christmas .
looking to your next match , you either have pretty highly ranked seed or niculescu , who beat you at wimbledon .
after elena nipped in and grabbed the no.1 at the end of the year without you looking , and now she 's won her first round match , is the feeling that the two of you are really going head-to-head nicely .
she 's talked about nervousness that gave her the cramps , the threat of losing that top hundred place . was that something also in your mind ?
was there a point last year where you thought , i now belong here ? i can do this ?
do you think from what you see around the place and looking at younger british players , do you think five years from now a british player winning a grand slam would be less of a big deal ?
why do you think that is ? has nigel 's influence done it , facilities , quality of people in the regions ?
say some experiences that helped you come to that realization .
why do you think the work ethic amongst the girls is different to what 's happening amongst the men at the moment ?
the perception is that you lot do n't take it for granted .
you were saying you feel at home here , i suppose you have n't packed any baked beans or tuna or anything in your bag .
what relatives do you have here ?
how old is she ?
you started with a new coach . how has that gone ?
we 'll let you do the talking . talk about the second set .
how valuable a lesson is that ?
did you put that down to the break you 've had from tennis ?
maybe at this level .
so what is next on the agenda for you ?
a partner there ?
and in mixed ?
who is your partner , though ?
how long do you think it 'll take you to get over it ?
putting aside the mental lapse , what other thing do you take from the way you 're playing ?
just generally , i guess , what else do you take about your game and i guess where you 're at and what you need to do ?
you had a very good 2008 obviously and a slightly rougher time last year . how do you view the return of kim and justine ? do you see their return as hurting your chances to get back into the upper rung ?
did you think it 's a bit unfair that everybody is focusing on those two and sharapova , players that are n't the top 10 ?
last year you came in as the no.1 with a lot attention . do you prefer to be a little bit left alone ?
you were rubbing something on your back between sets . are you hurt again ?
there are some younger players than you that are climbing up the world ranking : wozniacki , azarenka . which one are you most impressed about ?
in ana 's press conference earlier , she was saying that it 's nice to see so many new eastern european players coming up , because they add a lot excitement to the game . she did n't really elaborate , but is that something you agree with ?
what do you know about katie o ' brien , talking about new faces around ?
is it a case of talking to other girls in the locker room just to get some idea of what she might be like ?
wozniacki is no.4 in the world right now . are you surprised that she 's been able to climb up that high ?
she is .
no . she thinks that things have been developing very fast for her .
just talking about today 's game , what was the difference between the two sets ? you seemed to struggle a bit in the first set .
does it sometimes feel like you 're playing at home with all the supporters ?
not so much about your game , but there 's been a number of players younger than you climbing up the rankings last year . which one of them are you most impressed about ?
what about wozniacki ?
how do you assess your form today ?
is adam here or is he in the states ?
slight difficulty closing it out . must have been a thrill when you did .
is this even sweeter after the year you 've had ?
first memories of daniel a straight sets loss . we could see you were in pain when you were serving . how far do you feel you 've come in the year physically and mentally ?
since last year , what changes have you made to your game ?
did you have a short-term goal for the australian open and a longer term goal for the year ?
i think 2008 was the only other time you did n't get past the first round . this must be like a mini achievement .
it was a total reconstruction of the shoulder ?
are there times that you questioned whether you could get back and serve at full pace ?
what were you enjoy doing as a normal person , as you say ?
but the fire was still in the belly ?
your next opponent , a german .
it 's barrois .
sorry . i just finished writing about her .
is target still on board ?
is pratty still helping you ?
can you tell us , one set down , 1-6 in the first set , then you came back to win two tough second sets . how did you do it ?
would have been very disappointing to have lost the match after having come through the qualifying .
what did you do during the rain delays ?
how difficult was the preparation , coming through qualifying , with the controversy with the suspension ?
did you resent having to play qualifying ?
did you think it was wrong you had to play qualifying ?
did you think a little while ago that you 'd get here , play the australian open ? were you always confident you would get here ?
with all you 've been through , made you more determined to do well here ?
do you feel fresh physically , having played quallies ?
what are the other players saying to you about the suspension ? anybody saying anything ?
from your viewpoint , what went wrong ?
what are the challenges of playing someone you know so well and is a friend ?
is this one of the matches early in the season you were looking for consistency and it just was n't there today ?
was it a lack of match practice ? you needed a few more matches perhaps to sharpen up ?
your serve let you down again at crucial times . how much of a frustration has that become for you ?
so you 're happy with where your serve 's at ?
did you ever feel really good at any time during the match off the ground ?
in grand slams , you 've always given the impression of knowing exactly where the ball is going . have you lost a little bit of the belief that where you hit it is where it 's going to land ?
how would you describe your sense of confidence right now ?
what is your level of confidence like with your own body and your fitness ? does that play on your mind at all ?
your fitness , the shoulder .
during matches does it play any part ? is it holding you back at all ?
where is your level of disappointment , or do you just chalk it up , it 's first round of a grand slam , that can happen first round of a slam ?
why did n't you play any tournaments before ?
so do you go on and start thinking about paris now ?
about paris .
what do you say to yourself now in order to recover , let 's say , psychologically from a defeat which is painful , i guess ?
how would you sum up your first-round match ?
what pleased you most about the match ?
physically how are you feeling ?
a month ago did you expect to be here , or did you think physically maybe that would n't happen for you ?
when you left doha at the end of the year , what were you thinking in general about your year and how it went ?
so in the off-season when you were thinking about 2009 last year , what were your general thoughts ? were you happy about it ? do you think there were some missed opportunities ?
what do you think about the comeback of justine henin ? you were the one who beat her , and now she 's come back .
and for women 's tennis ?
sharapova said she thought this year would be maybe the most competitive in a long time because kim comes back , justine is back , some of the younger players are coming up , then all of you are in it . do you agree ?
would you say that you 're more motivated coming in here than you were last year ? how hard is it to maintain the same level of motivation year after year ?
so how is it to be out here now that your brother is no longer on tour ?
would that be the best win of your short career ?
did you have a game plan going into the match ?
what was going through your mind with two match points ?
at what point in the match did you know that you had her in the bag ?
you 've had some knee problems . suddenly did you feel like you were moving much better than you had for a long time ?
to be a friend of maria and know her well , it helps or it does n't help at all ?
is it possible i read on your lips vamos sometimes when you do a point , or not ?
what did you do in the off-season , and what was your routine leading up to this ?
when did you come here ?
you put your fingers to your lips late in the match . was that to get the crowd to quieten down ?
do you know that usually arshavin does the same when he kicks the goal ?
at 5-3 you threw away a couple of line challenges . you seemed quite desperate to get it finished . how important mentally is it to come through a match like that ?
is it hard as a returner to know what to expect with maria 's serve ?
last year you were playing a lot of doubles together with pennetta . everybody said it was the best pair from an aesthetic point of view . did you split up because there was a rivalry in terms of beauty ?
what did you think of maria 's outfit or costume ? do you ever pay attention to things like that ?
your boyfriend plays federer . have you had a word about how to take down the big guns ?
your thoughts after that ?
the whole month has n't been great . take us through your thoughts on that .
have you started the year in a hungry way . take us through your emotions that way .
are you hungry to get your best back ? is that still there in you ?
but the hunger is still there ?
how do you go about rebuilding that confidence now ?
obviously tough here after the open last year . emotionally are you in a good place to have a crack at this year ?
there was always a lot of expectation on you coming back here . do you think maybe a couple of weeks going somewhere else , playing a tournament somewhere else , might be the key ?
that 's what you 'll do now , get out of the loop a bit ?
how do you feel about your game today ?
what was your reaction to the draw when you saw it , knowing what was waiting for you in the second round ?
well , justine .
she was playing before you .
does n't matter .
do you think they should have seeded her ?
have you seen her progress in brisbane ?
how do you look forward to that match in two days ? she had your number a couple of times . it 's 9-2 in the stats , but a long time ago .
but you are playing well , too , now .
telling you or asking you . whatever .
what can you maybe draw from the past ?
was that a continuation of your brisbane form ?
what is your form like compared to the us open ? are you in a better frame of mind , hitting the ball better ?
what do you think of how valerie played in the second set ?
what is your target as far as the level you can get back to ? would you be happy if you got back to the same level as what you had before you stopped playing , or do you think you can actually get better ?
are there still some butterflies at a grand slam ?
this is the sixth tournament in your comeback . when do you think the questions will stop about the comeback ?
so there 's not parts of the game that are still rusty six or seven months in ? you feel like everything is up to that level ?
you were hit by a cramp . was as much of a surprise to you as it was to us watching ?
did the break help ?
do you think you 'll be able to relax a bit more for the next match now that you 've defended your points ?
looking back on last year , you played mauresmo . you had a few chances . do you feel that was one that got away a bit ?
just the conditions were difficult , terribly windy .
were you aware that half the crowd were turkish ?
was it disconcerting when she would be firing off a forehand , then six or seven would go flying off the edge , to get a rhythm , then shanked ?
jankovic was very aggressive today . is there any point where you thought , i 've got to do something different or i have to change gears ? did you try to change something that took that away ?
what game was that ?
you appeared to be having some trouble with your forehand today . can you talk about what happened with that ?
do you feel like you let her dictate too much today ? she was playing a little bit further inside the court .
do you feel she 's a tough matchup for you , just the style she plays and given she 's a veteran she knows how to play points pretty well ?
in our country , we often say no.1 ; no.1 , that 's all that really matters . now that you 're no.2 in the world , how hungry are you to become no.1 to get that top slot ?
and to get there , what do you think you have to do to get to the very top ?
you seem pretty disappointed . did you feel coming into the match that this was maybe one you could win ?
do you think that 's the best she 's played against you ?
what kind of advice did your coach give you ?
you do pretty well in this country . what do you like about the united states ? what gets you going ?
some of the reporters yesterday were saying that the people are a little bit on the old side , but you enjoy it a lot here . you find it relaxing ?
what town is that in ?
is the no.2 ranking any compensation for today 's loss ?
so if there 's anything you could have done differently today , other than just execution , what would that have been ?
can you compare today 's final with last year 's us open final ? looks like it was easier for you to play with clijsters than today with jankovic . do you agree ?
are you going to carry it on ?
now you have something new to put in the living room in san diego .
so do you feel like you 're back now as an elite player ?
do you feel like you 're back as a top-level player after this tournament ?
it seemed like when you went on the court you knew exactly what you had to do , you had beaten her three times . the match was pretty much in your hands and she really could n't hurt you .
so what 's the deal ? you 're a world-class athlete , been on the tour a long time , and can go for hours on court . could n't lift the trophy . what happened ?
was that a real setback to your self-image not to be able to lift it in front of ...
it is a little ironic that you went through that period where you were really trying to bulk up and it did n't really work for you .
you came into the tournament not in the greatest mood . you had the tough loss in monterrey . what happened in the last two weeks to make you happy again to find your game again ?
$ 700,000 , that has to be an immense help on the home in san diego .
are you building it or are you buying it ?
what stage is the home at ?
you also decided to play doubles this week . how did that partnership happen , and do you plan to play more doubles in the future ?
how did you choose tathiana to play with ?
which of the majors do you think you have the best chance of winning ?
does it matter to you if you 're a top 5 player ?
you won in cincinnati last year . your father was architect of that strategy . did you get any advice from your mother today ?
difficult day , but good week , right ?
what was the difference today ?
so what happened earlier on when you called for the trainer ? was it something to do with your shoulder or neck ?
what was your strategy against jankovic going into this match ?
were you a little bit tired ?
what do you take away from these few days , week and a half ?
how you feeling ? finals .
you said yesterday that with each match that went by you were gaining more and more confidence . i imagine you 're very confident going into the finals now ?
you 're going to be playing either caroline or agnieszka . can you talk a little bit about what it 's like to play them ?
she said after she lost that long game in the fifth game of the first set she started feeling frustrated . did you sense she was getting frustrated out there ?
sam , yeah .
can you tell us what happened on the last point ?
you know that it was her serve and not your return ?
and what do you think she think ?
you were surprised to see her surprise ?
can you speak about the whole match , please ?
were you nervous at 6-3 ?
what is your feeling to be in semifinal of this tournament ?
a straight-sets wins for you . did the confusing circumstances at the end of the match take any of the gloss off your victory at all ?
you 're projected to reach the top 10 next monday . what are your thoughts ? how does that help validate your successes as you 've been progressing up the tour ?
to what do you attribute your rise ? you 're having a wonderful year . it 's great . why ? what have you done that 's really pulled you up ?
what are your thoughts about your next opponent , jelena ?
tournament 's over , but it 's been a great run . what have you taking from this experience to get into the quarterfinals ?
over the last couple of months , your ranking has been rising steadily . is there one thing that you can kind of , pinpoint , that 's been the cause of that ? is it your fitness ? your increased foot speed ? what do you think has been the main ingredient ?
the russians speak very good english , and the people from the united states do n't speak good russian . do you have a tutor ? do the russian tennis players have a tutor ?
do you and pavlyuchenkova feel like you 're the younger generation than maybe trying to take over from the older generation of russians ? do you feel a bond with her at all ?
has any of the older generations of russians , any one of them , been particularly helpful to you ?
your game has been called unorthodox by tracy austin , but very successful for you . what do you have to say about that ?
i want to ask you about your english still . i 'm very envious of you , because my english is not good enough , as you can tell . so i was wondering , your english skill , if you can speak good english , do you think you can feel very comfortable on the tour in terms of like confidence level if you can speak good english , you can be very comfortable on the tour and you can make friends ?
could you explain , you are the only one on the tour who turns the head down when you hit the shot , does n't matter forehand , backhand , or serve . why do you do that ?
you 're on a run .
what was the best part of your match today ?
have you felt yourself getting better every match ? do you feel like you 're playing your way into ...
you had to dig out of a hole there in the second set ?
what 's the hardest adjustment to make when you 're coming from night matches to a day match ?
it seems like after the errani match where it was a fight and a struggle and you did n't have your level , and now you 've kind of gotten back up again and found it ; are you trusting your shots a little more ?
can you talk a little bit about playing either sam or maria .
you 've been on top for a long time . what is it going to take you to change your game to be no.1 ?
you talked about you did n't feel the ball well early in the tournament . now you do . when do you all of a sudden feel the ball ? what is that like ? how does that happen , that you suddenly can feel the ball well ?
after the struggles for the last few months , what would a couple more wins here do for your confidence ?
must have been nice to smile after a win . that 's been a while , eh ?
you spoke about how difficult it was getting into the rhythm today . what are you feeling when you were trailing 2-4 down in that second set ? frustration ? a mixture of things ?
is it different in all of this year reaching the semis compared to a couple of years ago ?
it 's not lonely in there ?
you trimmed your schedule down significantly this year . how has that helped you ? you 're a lot fitter , less injuries .
you have n't lost a set the whole tournament . do you think the level you 're at right now is good enough to get to the final and maybe win the title ?
why do you think you 've had so much success against dementieva ? you seem to give her some real problems .
you 're 4-2 now .
she seems to get very frustrated against you . she was very frustrated at the end of the match .
you 're 3-1 now against her on hardcourt surfaces . do you always feel more comfortable playing her on hardcourt ?
you had that great dropshot exchange the fourth game of the second set where you were both dropshotting each other .
can you enjoy a point like that ? and how much does your feel for the ball frustrate her ? you really do n't give her the pace she likes .
you 're right at your career-high ranking now at no.8 , and you 've been in the top 10 now for about two years . do you feel like your level is about to go up a little more ? maybe you can reach the top 5 ?
game-wise , how much more do you think you can improve ?
when you say you can keep improving , anything specifically that you 're referring to ?
do you think the conditions here help your game a little bit more ?
you 've spoken about getting into the top 10. have you set a goal for the end of this year ? top 5 or what ? and also , what do you need to do to take that next step ? you 're saying you need to work harder or work more , but what is it specifically that you feel you need to do ? what are those targets ?
what about targets , goals ?
yes .
you 've been in what , three grand slams quarterfinals , no ?
do you think maybe semifinals this year or final or something a little bit better than you 've done in the past , or do you feel like maybe my game 's not good enough to get there ?
which major do you feel most comfortable at and is most conducive to your game , which grand slam tournament ?
are you a patient person , that you can see that quarterfinals and then maybe taking it the next step to semis and the next step to the finals , or do you just want to rush there ?

does it affect you gripping the racquet ?
it 's been a couple of years now since you made the breakthrough and started getting a bit known and getting more and more attention . are you comfortable with the attention you get now , and do you like it ?
so if caroline wins tonight - and she 's your very good friend - do you go out to dinner beforehand ? do you say you ca n't go out to dinner tonight because we have to play each other ?

so if you guys play each other --
-- does the winner get to buy dinner the next time ?
do you speak in english or in polish ?
i know that radwanska has done well against you in the past , but what was the problem today ?
what happened at 4-4 , 0-30 for her ? you lost eight points in a row .
what makes it tricky playing her ? your head to head with her is now 2 and 4. what 's hard about her game for you ?
having played her so many times , how did the conditions here this year compare to previous years ? if they 're good , have they helped you in any way ? if they 're bad , have they hurt you in any way , or which way ?
the speed of the court and things like that .
why are there so many tall players in women 's tennis ? how much has your height helped you ?
why so many tall players ?
you mentioned you enjoyed your stay in indian wells . have you enjoyed any of the local food ? if so , any of the local restaurants come to mind that you enjoyed ?
if you had one thing to work on after today 's match , what would that be ?
just assess your level of play . you seem to be moving pretty well through the draw .
so do you feel like you were playing at a pretty high level ?
do you feel like you need to play very well to win matches , or just b level , 80 % ?
what do you think about your opponent 's game today ?
so completely different match , the next one , huh ?
is she hard to read , her game ?
you and caroline wozniacki are the highest seeds left in the tournament . do you think maybe some of the expectations for the players that are coming back , kim and justine - maybe maria , although her situation is different because she 's coming back from an injury - are too high because they had some quick early success ?
but we should expect some ups and downs from those players that are coming back like that , no ?
do you think wozniacki is for sure a top 5 player if she stays healthy , staying in the top 5 the next five years or so ? talk to me about her game and what she needs to do to get just a little bit better .
can you win just by playing smart , or do you need to have big weapons , too ?
what do you think of your performance today ?
are you happy in general with your year ? you 've had some good wins and some tough losses , too .
are you feeling confident in third sets right now ?
what do you tell yourself ? with the second set the way it was , what do you kind of tell yourself in between going into the third set that you need to change ?
is there one thing you can point to that you 're better at than you were a year ago ?
so you 're not getting down on yourself mentally , even if you have a bad game or a bad set ?
how have you managed to stay focused and positive on court given what 's happened with you off court ?
the hearing comes up in april ; is that right ?
so you have no idea . do you know what the process is ?
you 're just leaving that aside because you want to focus on your tennis and you 're letting other people ...
even though it was a loss , i think the match against justine in australia was a pretty high-quality match . were you disappointed with it , or could you see good parts of that match for you ?
you play azarenka in the next round . she 's another young player like you , top 10 player . i would think it 's an important match .
that was quite an adventure . the second set you served for it and you have all the set points , and then she gets even with the dropshot , you come all the way back . how did you stay mentally positive ?
when you say you lose it mentally , where do you go ? where does your mind go ?
you said it was more mental than physical , but that was a long match and some long rallies . did you feel it at all on your legs and your lungs ?
seemed like you played very well from one 1-4 down in the third , and you were taking charge of the rallies .
what was the worst thought you had during the match ?
how does a match like that affect you for the rest of the tournament ? does it help you , or is it exhausting ?
did you play aggressively enough for your own liking ?
you 're up a break at 3-2 and then you got treated for what on your arm ? what happened there ?
was there a lot of pain there ?
is that a new injury or something you 've felt in the past many times ?
how much did it affect you in those last few games ? did that make a difference at the end ?
you returned well ...
you were having a heck of a time holding . was that ...
she put a lot of balls in play , no ?
you sound a little down . are you optimistic about your game right now or worried about it or worried about your arm ?
of the top players , who would you say is the most consistent , the steadiest ?
what is it going to take for you now to get back up on top again since you 've been there , you 've enjoyed it , and you know what it takes mentally ? what 's it going to take for you to get back up there again ?
but you do see it as a mystery right now ?
i thought you used the word `` mystery . ''
obviously kim and then justine made comebacks , granted after retirements rather than injuries , and scored huge wins . tough question , but stepping back , are you a little disappointed that you have n't been able to really break through , and what 's your assessment of the situation ?
yes .
so you 're not feeling a sense of frustration , or am i misinterpreting what you 're saying ?
coming off the chair at 3-2 after the timeout , did you have confidence ? you 're up a break . at least you were returning well in the set , and then the wheels came off a little bit . was it competence or ...
that 's how you felt , that it just went down and she went up , and all of a sudden it 's over ?
so look ahead a little bit . miami is obviously going to be big i would think before you get back on the clay .
so what 's the approach in the next week going in there ?
do you need to get the arm checked or x-rayed or anything like that , do you think ?
what was your feeling about your spectacular contract with nike ? were you happy with that ? can you reflect on that , please ?
second set you went down 1-4. what did you need to shift in order to suddenly win the next five games and take that second set ?
you had some great runs , us open obviously , you gave justine quite a challenge at the australia open . what do you take away from your performances at the slams ?
you 're quite tall and you have a very high service toss . how much of an advantage does your height and your toss give you on the serve , if any ?
have you looked ahead to the draw ? and how do you feel about , you know , the upcoming match ?
when we saw you last year making that run at the open , your serve really , i thought , picked up and was really the foundation of your game . what have you been doing in the offseason , and did what you had to go through in the offseason , did that affect your training or you preparation or anything at all ?
did you train in florida or in belgium ?
speaking about what you 've gone through in the offseason , do you have an update on what 's going on with the itf ?
obviously you 're dealing with it , but it does n't seem to have phased you . how do you put that aside to focus on the tennis ?
even though you 're a young person , you have had a lot of challenging life experiences , not only the whole thing with the federation , but your mom and all that . how do you stay positive and inspired and motivated ?
frustrating time for you today ?
it seemed towards the end of the second set you had begun to feel your range . did you feel that , or no ?
when you say you did n't do what you had to do , is that to play more aggressively , or what should you have done that you did n't do ?
you still have nerves ?
but at the end i think you tossed your racquet once . were you just frustrated ?
you get mad at the ball , or do you get mad at yourself ?
are your nerves more a problem when you are no.1 seed than when you are n't ?
i 'd like to ask you sort of a general question . you 've been on tour for many , many years . what are your thoughts about us , about the media ? what are the things you really like , you do n't like , and do you think we do a good job or maybe not ?
she played 10 feet behind the baseline , and you volley so well . i was wondering , it was obvious that you were not feeling the ball well today . i thought you might be able to intimidate her a little bit more by coming to the net .
what was the reason for your stepping ? were you trying to loosen the strings ?
you come from a fantastic russian sports family . what the heck happened in vancouver to the russian team , do you think ?
so is it good that in tennis there are not style points like in figure skating ? is that good that you 're not judged on your ...
did you watch the hit for haiti last night ?
the hit for haiti exhibition , did you watch it ?
what do you think about your draw there looking ahead ?
you just like to look at them one at a time ?
as far as where you 're at in your comeback , do you feel you 've gotten the point you do n't have to worry about rust and moving ahead , or is there still that battle of rust and getting into tour mode ?
i remember that when you had losses in the past , you were able to get over them reasonably quickly . what was it like after the australian open ? was it one you just put to one side because it was just a shocking day or ...
when you were out of tennis for a while and then you 're watching the players play , in your wildest dreams , did you think you 'd reintegrate yourself this successfully this fast ?
after the petrova loss , you were saying you had no idea what happened , no clue whatsoever . when you went back home did you watch the tape and did you figure anything out at all ?
after you won in new york , there was that magical moment with your daughter and seeing herself on the big screen , mother and daughter and all that . does she have any sensibility that ...
she 's way to young for that ?
speaking of the garden , how can you compare madison square garden , and of course this is the indian wells tennis garden . can you compare the two ?
but i understand that new yorkers took you in at a whole new level during the xo a few weeks ago . is that because of your time in new jersey and your husband living in new jersey , or just because you won the open ?
before you retire , there were times when you were at your best and you were playing a lot of matches . and now with the lifestyle , with the baby , you ca n't do that anymore . were you tempted at all after australia to say , maybe i should go play a tournament in february , or were you just pretty much set it up saying , i 'm going to play my schedule , and if i do n't play that well , i 'll still take the month off because i have to be with the baby ?
your favorite part of being a housewife ?
and the follow-up to the previous , does it make it better for you now that this is more fun than it is a job ? it 's like your other job , and you can have fun with it in a different way than before ?
how did you feel about your performance ?
so what 's the key about her ? she 's a veteran player , plays a little bit of a different style .
so did you play a little more patiently and wait for your opportunities to hit the bigger ball ?
so coming to net and taking volleys is sort of a new step for you , to do it consistently . are you feeling more comfortable doing it now ?
you 're doing it because you feel like what , it 's the next stage or it 's easier to close out points or what ? be more all around ?
so do you have to force yourself to get up there , or is it starting to come more naturally ?
so talk to me about your results this year . you 've had pretty good results , but some tough losses there . just where do you feel you are in general ?
so do you feel like you 're really close to beating elena or serena or venus maybe on a consistent basis , because you 're a top 6 player now , too .
so is it more experience that you 're looking for more than anything ?
with this event so close to arizona , do you have some friends and family that are able to come down and cheer you on locally here ?
do you feel better playing when you have friends and family around , or is it easier if you do n't have the friends and family around ?
so i guess it 's going pretty well with sam . it 's going well your coach ?
great match . i watched it . you were very focused today and really had control of what was going on . so i wonder , second set , 4-2 , and then you got down about three games . what was going on in your mind then ?
it was great to watch .
are you going to be playing more doubles in the future ? i know you 're not playing this week . are you going to play doubles in miami ?
what are you doing in the clay court season schedule-wise ?
marbella is going to be your one smaller event during the six months ?
marbella , charleston , and then rome , madrid ...
it 's a lot .
it was a very kind of streaky match . she had 12 straight match and at one point you were down 4-1. how did you turn it around ?
in boxing parlance , it could be said you got off the floor to win today . mikkel kessler would be proud of you . as you noted , you were behind 4-1 the last set , and vania just won 12 straight points . what was going through your mind at that point ?
were you surprised by the level of her play throughout the match ?
did you do anything tactically to adjust ? it looked like you went after her second serve more in the last set .
your movement is such a strength , but it can also be sort of a defense . how are you going to use your movement offensively ? is that something you want to do ?
i saw a little bit of the match . your father came out . what kind of things was he telling you , and how helpful is he ?
do you have any trouble , because it 's your father , listening to everything he says ?
do you think having that testing match will make you tougher for the rest of the tournament ?
who do you like to win the fight on saturday night against joshua clottey ?
that 's what i thought you would say .
manny pacquiao . he 's widely considered the greatest fighter in the world at the moment .
he 's a little bit small to be fighting mikkel kessler .
welterweight , 147 .
are you at all interested in watching the matches tonight ?
yeah .
will it be fun for you to see steffi ? not many people get to see steffi play . she does n't do this very much . do you remember her when you were growing up ? what do you think about watching her tonight ?
was this a different henin at all , could you tell , than the one who played before her retirement ? was she less intimidating ? was it any different for you ?
how did you mentally approach that last game , because you had the lead ? she came back and you had to step up and finish the match . what was going through your mind at that time ?
you won that last game at love . was that very satisfying to you ?
you 've had huge wins , obviously beating sharapova and ivanovic . how does this win compare for you to the other wins you 've had ?
you noted that she is a great champion , but did you find that her game has regressed since she took the time off before coming back ?
seems like you 've flattened out your forehand a little more and play a little more , you know , aggressive , offensive . how do you feel your game has evolved over the last few years and changed and improved ?
you looked more relieved than anything at the end . is it just shock or ...
what most pleased you about the way you played and the way you kept battling ? just a simple thing like coming back 5-1 down in the final set tiebreak or ...
when she double faulted on match point ?
you 've had a remarkable year in any respect . is it possible to put your finger on one reason or a couple of reasons why it 's just blossomed all of a sudden ?
to continue the confidence thing then , what was going through your mind in the second set , and what did you say to yourself at the start of the third to turn it around ?
did the fact that you had your matches against safina and sharapova , does that help you think when you 've played big players to come into a match like this in these circumstances and play another big player ?
i take it you must take a lot of confidence from , you know , when you 're playing somebody like that not being overpowered . you were in control of lots of those rallies .
were you aware of the fact that as you were going toe-to-toe with her , she was getting grumpier and grumpier at the other end ?
any thoughts on molik next round ?
what do you do to stop yourself from having a letdown after a day like this ? i know you 'll have a day off .
what is the key to that , then ?
have you had any reaction already from home or friends or family ?
my question is you beat her in two straight sets . why do you feel like she was struggling ? we could totally see that you had the overhand , and that you were just a better player than her , but how do you feel that what were her weaknesses compared to your strengths ?
( through translation . ) today you seemed to have controlled your game throughout the match . is that because you have reached the top 10 and both tactically and mentally you have changed a great deal ? if that really is the case , is it due to the crucial points that you can always take these many because that you have good improve in mental aspect ?
( through translation . ) in this year 's china open and also in the madrid tennis competition you have done some charity work . you promise to donate your prize money . in madrid you have reached the quarterfinal but lost to peer . in this year 's china open , if you reach the quarterfinal will you be doing the same ?
( through translation . ) can you comment on your next opponent , sevastova or petrova ? and another question , this year you have reached the china open quarterfinal which tied your best record here . how are you feeling now ?
( through translation . ) yesterday there were media reports talking about your focus has been turned to the development and training for the junior players . does that imply that you have already reached your best and now you are going downhill ?
( through translation . ) today you played the day match . yesterday you played the evening match . do you think that there is any difference when you play the day session and the evening session matches ? regarding the charity work , is this the motivation that encourages you to continue to fight on court , to play your best tennis on court ?
( through translation . ) in 2000 you played your first wta tournament in shanghai and this year in china open 2010 in beijing . you are still playing . through all these past 10 years , do you think there 's any progress and changes about the tournament held by china ? second question : when you are playing the tournaments either at home or abroad , when you are talking with foreigners , how do you think about china 's tournament ?
( through translation . ) now the chinese tennis association are going to make a new partnership for the ladies doubles team . what do you think the possibility of playing the ladies doubles ?
how does the pressure playing in the china open compare to playing a grand slam ?
how would you sum that up ?
we have to ask you about the leg , the left knee .
is it just a ligament problem or strain ? is it an impact joint in general terms ?
how are you feeling going into next week now ?
has the injury of the leg caused any pain in the previous matches ?
that was my next question : are you gon na play doubles in melbourne , or would you still preserve the body for singles ?
congratulations , firstly .
talk about how satisfying it is for you .
how much of a confidence boost is it to you leading into the open ?
last year you played six times and won three and serena won three . do you think you 're getting closer , or do you feel like your game is not far away from need to be after beating someone like serena ?
did you see her hobbling around on the leg a couple times in the first set , the left knee strapping ?
have you seen your draw ?
so if you beat dushevina you could play against justine henin . what is your feeling about that ?
it 's the first time you played serena , but you did n't seem intimidated out there .
did you think you had it won , 5-2 in the second ?
do you think that the way she came back at you from 5-2 down and then as you say from the 40-love game , do you think that was her raising her game , or did you make errors ?
you do have some good results against players that have been no.1 , sharapova , safina , so clearly you can raise your level to play with those players .
you had a great 2009 , perfect finish . what are your expectations for this season ?
out of all the players you played against , is serena the most difficult player to play against , do you feel ?
just on another subject , i understand you won some gold medals at the muslim woman 's games in iran a couple years ago .
how does that work ?
did that seem very unusual for you , just playing in front of women ?
is that a regular event ? would you play it again , or was it just one time ?
you played today against the australian open champion and nearly beaten her . you must really like your chances of doing something in melbourne next week ?
you must feel some confidence . you 've beaten pennetta , no.12 , you 've taken the no.1 to three sets . you must feel like you 're playing as well as anybody ?
same attitude ?
is serena 's mental toughness what makes her no.1 as much as actual game itself ? just the fight she 's got in every match , is that what sets her a little bit above everyone else ?
her mental toughness , is that what sets her above everyone else ?
you wear very distinctive clothing on court . talk about that .
how did you link up with her ?
so the the inspiration sort of disco ?
you had late night last , but clearly did n't affect you today . you seemed to get through this match fairly comfortably .
you now face serena .
how do you feel about that match ?
you beat her in the semifinal last year , though .
semi , yeah . does that ...
does she become an even more formidable opponent when she 's in sight of the trophy ? i guess you do n't play her very early in tournaments at all , but ...
you said last night that you were happier with your serve . obviously in that condition , you hoped to take that into daytime conditions . do you feel like you did that today ?
so you had some practice this afternoon ?
how are you feeling going into the aussie open ? you seem relaxed .
is it a grand slam that you feel like you 've got a good chance of winning ?
why do you think you have played here so well the last couple of years ?
ticks all the boxes .
did prefer the heat yesterday or the wind today ?
you did n't seem particularly happy with your form out there today . on court you seemed to be a bit down or yourself at times .
how far off your best do you think you are ?
a lot of players talk about getting ready for the end the grand slams . how did you pace yourself to peak at the right time ?
the brace you were wearing on your right ankle , was it sore or anything ?
for so reason ?
you won the australian open more times than any of the other grand slams . why do you think that event has brought out the best in you ?
last year you described that the match against kuznetsova as a out-of-body experience . do you think the physical demands of the australian open suit are more then some of the other players ?
have you met margaret court ?
looks like she 's gon na present the trophy on friday .
yeah .
that is a large bag you 're carrying . would you like to share with us what you have in it ?
ipod ?
justine in on the comeback trail as well . do you took forward to playing her again ?
are you surprised by the form she showed last week in brisbane ?
you fancy doing that , having a year off ?
your semifinal opponent is aravane rezai . have you played her lately ?
will you consult venus before playing ?
you struggled a bit at this tournament last year , and obviously it did n't impact you all at the australian open . you seemed to be getting through the matches a bit more comfortably this year . do you feel like you 're a little bit further ahead ?
do you feel like you 're behind because you have n't played as many matches , or is it something else ?
so you feel like you 've got a bit more to do to be ready for the australian open ?
both days , very slow start . down love-5 in each match . what was causing that , do you think ?
speaking to your coach after the match , what did he have to say to you ?
even though you lost the match , i imagine it 's very good preparation because you did play some high-quality tennis in the second set .
when it started to rain to the second set , you seemed a bit concerned about the courts .
do you feel they should have carried the game over to tomorrow ?
d you feel look i played enough good tennis today to give you some confidence to take into next week ?
you 've now won i think your last four meetings with dinara . why do you think your game matches up so well to hers ?
did the rain play a part at all ?
you think the game would n't go ahead ? were you worried you 'd be held over to tomorrow ?
dinara got off to a slow start , but after she sort of get into the match it was a pretty high-quality match , was n't ?
very good preparation , i imagine , for next week .
does it give you confidence ?
thoughts on azarenka tomorrow ?
you must feel at the moment you can beat anyone the way you 're playing .
serve has improved this week , do you feel ?
nice workout for you today ?
enjoy the heat ?
also question of trying to conserve a little energy as well because it 's a long week and it 's your first match and it 's pretty hot ?
the first match of the tournament and first match of the year . how did you feel ?
when you start a new year , you 've already achieved so much , do you set yourself any targets ?
what 's the target roughly ? what 's the number of tournaments ?
i 'm not sure if you 've seen your side of the draw but the seeds have been decimated . you 're the only one left . obviously you wo n't play another top 10 player until perhaps the final . would you prefer to be playing girls at that level going through the tournament , or is it a bit easier to sort of work up to the australian open ?
is it more the match practice going into the aussie open ?
do you enjoy this challenge of the other players rising against you ?
the seeds have fallen and the fright you got in round one here last year , did you have any particular nerves going into this match ?
what did your mom say about snow boarding ?
she has n't said anything yet ?
have you have had chance to get around sydney much ?
you ever attempted to do the bridge climb ?
you 've won the aussie open every alternate year ...
what have you changed this year to change this sequence ?
your outfit , is it orange , red ?
what do you think about how well justine henin has come back ? a final in the first tournament last week .
obviously she looks like she 'll in contention again .
you said on television the other day that you ca n't remember ever feeling more relaxed going into a grand slam . why is that ?
does holding the no.1 ranging make any difference to you ?
how did that feel ?
how come it took until love-5 you were down ? was it the back entirely , or the fact that you have n't played for a long time ?
did you have any problems with your back ?
you wanted to play brisbane but you were n't ready . were you worried at any time you that would n't be ready to come to australia ?
were you able to practice before ? were you able to hit the backhand before mid-december ?
nothing at all before ?
what exactly what the problem ?
are you getting ongoing treatment ? what are you doing ?
yeah . are you getting ongoing treatment from a specialist ?
normally with back problems it 's a matter of getting it right and managing it and making sure it does n't get bad again . is that the way it is ?
are you continuing to do those exercises to prevent it happening again ?
given all those problems , do you feel you 're going into the australian open a little underdone compared to previous years ?
when you said you sort of snapped in at 5-love down in the first set , what happened that sort of helped you to click into your rhythm ? was it one particular shot that suddenly made you feel comfortable or a change in the mindset ?
you must be happy the way you kept your composure when you were struggling so much that first set .
how hot do you feel it was out there ?
i guess that 's also quite difficult if you have n't spent a lot time in the heat coming in .
you 've been here a week , have n't you ?
how much of the women 's draw does having players like justine henin back , how much does it help the competition ?
what about someone like justine , who does n't have a ranking or a seeding and she 'll be floating around in the draw , do you think about things like that at as a top player ?
in the last 18 months , you made three grand slam finals and reached the no.1 ranking . what do you think you need to do to take the next step to win a grand slam ?
what do you think you learned from those matches , particularly in australia last year ?
do you feel like you 've become more comfortable with each time you 've been in that situation ?
one more question about the belgian girls . do you think kim and justine can be a danger for you at the australian open ?
when you look back rat the australian open last year , the final did n't go the way you wanted it to . do you have fond memories of the tournament , or did the disappointment of losing wipe it all away ?
not the easiest start at that time year for you .
you kind of half expected this week not to play your best ?
what is it you need to improve in practice to be ready for the australian open ?
not only yourself , but a number of seeded players have gone out here early in the week . is it enough preparation for a grand slam tournament ?
was it better for a grand slam champion like yourself , you 've been there and done it , you can probably come in off a little bit less preparation and sort of find your rhythm at the open rather than some of young are players ?
svetlana , you do n't think this is a setback for your australian open campaign ; is that what you 're saying ?
you were saying that you perhaps considered playing brisbane ban and auckland but the wta ...
can you understand an organization not letting one of their top players , a grand slam champion , play an event ?
you 've won the grand slam on clay and hardcourts . australian open should really suit you . what in the past has been the problems being able to produce your best in melbourne ?
do you think that experience in australia last year actually helped you to cope with that situation at the french open better ?
do you feel this is the best you 've gone into an australian open with all your experiences behind you ? do you think you 're ready rake that step up now ?
two titles in one week . that 's a pretty good week for you .
are you tired at all going into the us open ?
you really do n't go anywhere just to get some work in . a lot of players come here to get in a few matches and get ready . you come to win , right ?
how tough was this one today ? how tough was this whole week ?
the first set went according to plan . you were up 2-love in the second set . what did she do to get back in the match ?
do you get a sense of appreciation for the people here ?
venus won it four times , you won it three . that 's good company to be in . what makes this place so special for you ?
did you feel like the tenor of the match changed between the first and second set ?
with all those breaks , can you talk about when you finally got the one in the eighth game , it 's your serve again , what were you thinking about in terms of being able to hold that game and finish then ?
where are the other two trophies and where is that one going to go ?
after venus won her fourth , she did n't return because her schedule got too hectic . do you ever foresee yourself not wanting to come here ? do you think this is part of your regular routine now ?
venus won here four times . two of those four times she went on to win the us open . did you know that ?
maybe this is your year .
how does this victory work into your mindset heading into the us open ?
you had to fight from behind all day long . almost got there , but not quite .
what happened to your back ? tweak it a little bit ?
you had 12 aces in the match . she was still able to break you . neither of you seemed to be able to hold a serve in the second set .
how do you feel heading into the open after a long week of challenging matches ?
can you talk about the confidence in your hard court game . you said because you played so few matches , that 's kind of what you were looking for .
can you talk about what makes her so challenging to play , what about her game gives you trouble ?
what do you think about this tournament , organization , compared with other tournaments ? what can you say about it ?
what will you take away from this tournament that you did n't bring with you ? what skills do you think you gained here ?
so this was good preparation ?
can you tell us what changed in the match between the first and second set that nobody could hold serve .
caroline mentioned the sun was tricky out there . did you have trouble with that ?
the back injury slow you down a step , half a step ? did it make a difference in the third ?
was it in this match that the back was bothering you ?
you expect to be fine for the open ?
you were serving at 1-4 in the third .
ever happen before ?
how did that one feel ?
got off to a slow start . you called your coach out at the first changeover . can you explain about what you talked about that early in the match .
you have a triple match point and she hit the ball into the net three times . she comes back , wins the game . what is going through your head ?
talk about the injury . is that something that happened tonight or preexisting ?
what is the treatment between now and tomorrow ?
are you feeling any pressure from being no.1 in the open ?
talk a little bit about your unbeaten streak here . is it just something about this court ?
breaking each other back and forth at the end of that second set . as you 're holding , do you feel them ticking away , you have to get that break ?
being ranked no.1 at the us open , does it feel any different , notice any difference the way you 're treated ?
what do you do now looking ahead to the final against nadia ? do you put to one side the three results that you 've had in the past with her ?
you came into the us open last year after this tournament , so you played some matches . now you had montral , bit of a difficult week . do you feel tired at all ?
slow start , but you picked it up in the second . did you find your serve or what ?
from the first match , you start slowly then seem to pick it up and dominate . is that typical ?
can you talk about how you 're feeling after that first set . was there any frustration ?
when you see she has an injury to her back , how much does the game plan change ? are you hitting different shots ?
what a difference a year makes from here . you lose in the first round last year , now you 're playing in the finals .
can you talk about taking advantage of the opportunity you got at the last second to get into this tournament .
first final since '08 .
do you feel you 're playing better tennis ?
looking to the final , let 's say it was elena you were to play , you lost to her the last five times .
what do you do to turn that around ? how do you look ahead to playing another russian ?
if it is caroline , she won the last two years , she won the two matches you played out of the three on hard court .
is it easy to put to one side the fact that she 's won here the last two years and is obviously extremely comfortable in the conditions , the crowd , the court surface ?
at indian wells you were really in the lead against wozniacki and seemed to get very angry with yourself at that point .
you 've played your best tennis this year in the slams , wins over clijsters and venus . is there something as you get older that makes it easier for you to get more motivated for those matches ?
did you have a problem with your back and did that affect the match after the first set ?
it 's a pulled muscle and you think you 'll be fine for next week ?
did you feel like the match was yours to lose ? you had had such success in the first set , up in the second .
were you almost in tears at one time on the sideline with the back pain ?
this back , is it something that has bothered you in the past ?
do you think it happened when you were reaching for a shot in the first set ?
is it meaningful to clinch the us open series ? does it say you 're playing well or is it nice to have that bonus money waiting there ?
are you glad to have the day off or would you prefer to get another match ?
last year you spoke about applying to yale . what happened with that ?
on an online basis , obviously ?
why does that interest you ?
do you have classes or courses in mind that interest you ?
just to figure out what you 're going to do with all your career earnings ?
can you talk about how much you 've improved your game the last couple years , what areas you think you 've really made major steps in .
this being one of them ?
any thoughts on tomorrow night 's match against elena ?
have you looked at your us open draw yet ?
never look at it ?
is there anything you consider your strength right now when you 're on the court ?
can you address the off-court aspect of glamour in women 's tennis , the importance of that , how much you enjoy that side of it .
i think it was this time last year that the stella mccartney aspect came up .
at that time you were saying you did n't have that much involvement ; you had n't met her at that stage . have things taken a step forward with that ?
is it important to be both feminine and a great athlete ?
she obviously knows you pretty well . doubles partners . did that have something to do with how she was able to figure out what to do out there ?
seems like your backhand slice was letting you down a little bit . is that a shot you 've been working on for the open ?
how is your arm feeling ?
was it more how well she was playing or did some things let you down today ?
how much of what you do out on the court , your style of play , is with an eye towards the open ?
going into the open in terms of confidence , your hard court season , having to take the break , how are you feeling ?
there are three russians in the semifinals . you 've been on tour long enough . what is it about the russians that you 've noticed and the way they develop tennis players ?
6-1 , 6-2 seemed surprisingly easy over stosur today . what was it that you were doing well ?
it appears there are going to be three russians in the finals here .
is there rhyme or reason to that ? why is it so many talented players are from russia ?
is it a huge emphasis as a kid in russia , tennis ?
seemed like one of the tactics today was to attack sam 's backhand quite a bit to open up her forehand . can you talk about that .
is it easier for you to play another russian or easier to play a non-russian ?
is it more satisfying to beat a russian or non-russian ?
when you come here , being it 's the week before the open , is getting a title as important as getting your game finely tuned for the open ?
obviously you two are very familiar with each other . talk about what you were able to do today to overcome her .
do you think her play had anything to do with her back or she just did n't seem aggressive ?
have you seen your draw in the open ? if so , what do you think about it ?
i did n't look . what was it today ? what did you do special ?
you got barbora strycova in the first round .
do you think your game is coming around ? is it where you want to be going into next week ?
is it easier for you to play another russian or is it easier to play a non-russian ? there was the match against the other maria in melbourne first round , all that .
at the end , if you win , is it a more satisfying win ? how do you feel at the end of a match against a russian or a non-russian ?
so many talented russians on tour now . what is the emphasis in russia growing up ?
as far as women 's tennis is concerned , there is that glamorous image : you , caroline , maria . there 's a host of very beautiful young ladies who could be just at home on the tennis court as they could be on a catwalk . how important is that for the game ?
saw you were playing with the bandages after the first game . the trainer came out . seemed like new bandages . is that a new injury on that leg ?
any affect on your play , the injury ?
have you ever had such a frustrating day when your strokes wo n't behave ?
were you having timing issues with the serve today ?
how were you in practice ? were you sensing it was n't your day ?
so you felt good at the start of the match ? when did you start not feeling right ?
your power is a great asset . with the clay coming up there 's a premium on consistency . is that a concern with your groundstrokes at this stage ?
well , that 's up to you to answer . depends how well you felt you were hitting it .
well , overall .
at one point did you consider like a t.o . talk to a coach , serena , dad , anybody ?
what are you feeling when the match is going so quickly like that and just nothing is going right ? how did you keep playing ? what keeps you going ? what are you thinking or feeling at that point ?
physically today how far off from 100 % were you ?
ever feel like throwing serena your racquet ?
you have a few weeks off now . do you rest the knees and not go on the court ? do you start practicing right away ?
how long ?
have you managed to talk to mary joe ...
what 's your reaction ?
what is it exactly that 's wrong with the left leg ?
was it in pain ?
it was in pain . does it often get worse through a tournament . do you feel that by the semifinals ?
you just said the other day that you had n't had a very long stretch where your knee felt good . are we still in that stretch ?
is it surprising to see how well kim has done after her comeback and justine to just be able to go through a lot of top-ranked players right off the top ?
did you feel the support from the crowd when they started cheering when you were down in the second set ?
what do you do when you take time off ? how do you spend your time off ?
do you drive from home to your matches ?
oh , yeah , a lot traffic today .
congratulations ?
was there a point in that match , maybe at 3-love in the second , where you said to yourself , i ca n't believe this ?
you said the other day that you guys never play good on the same day . i guess you 're glad you did today , but at one point did you feel like ...
do you feel like at one point just keep the ball in play and let her make the mistake ?
you 've been talking about playing aggressively and moving forward and taking the ball early and stuff . how hard is it to do that when you 're not getting the responses from your opponent ?
when venus was talking about her game today , she said even the best players have days like this sometimes , and she compared it to your day in australia . did you ever figure out what happened that day ?
i 'm guessing your goal is to become no.1 again . looking at your game , how far do you think you are ?
you 're gon na be playing a clay court season for the first time in many years .
how are feeling about that , and what do you ...
we used to see the shot where you did the splits . you do n't seem to be playing that shot very much anymore . is that because you 're fitter and therefore getting to the ball is a little easier and you do n't have to defend as much as you used to ?
how much would it mean to you to win slam other than the us open ? would that be important or ...
you mentioned on the court that now that you have a child and family and all that that your time that you 're playing is almost a getaway for you now . can you elaborate on that a little bit ?
at any point in the match did you feel like , this is venus williams . she always does this , but she always fights to the end and comes back . was that in the back of your mind ?
seems like since your comeback it 's either you 're winning a tournament or getting to the finals or out in the first couple rounds . is that a function of a comeback or your limited schedule ?
a lot of top players talk about their kids and my kid 's never gon na go near tennis and have that kind of attitude . seems like you may think a little bit differently about that ; is that true ?
what did your daughter say before the match or after to celebrate your championship ?
can you talk about the match today ? what was the difference today for you ?
have you ever double faulted a game away like that ?
when you lost the wimbledon final to her , you remarked about her power .
did you think it 's increased ?
in the second set , she did very well at the net . she was very successful with her volleys . can you talk about her play and how that affected you ?
did you notice her sister right there ?
before you served , you had some exercises or whatever you would call it with your legs , bending or a can-can sort of thing .
did you think venus was impersonating you when you met at the net ?
no , she met you at the net after the match and she was kind of doing the bouncing . did you notice that when you shook hands ?
obviously you wanted to be in the final and you 're probably disappointed , but it will either be venus/henin or venus/clijsters . do you think either will be a good final ? and how do you think venus will do ?
what was serena wearing ?
and she has a knee injury .
did you feel like you had two williamses on the other side of the net at times ?
in that second set when she was up 3-2 and she went over for treatment , did you they 're maybe she was in trouble ?
that was your first time playing her . what were your impressions of her game ?
the critical call , the critical break in the second set , baseline , it really led to the break to go up 5-3. did that bother you at all mentally ?
how do you rate the quality of that match ?
you 're much younger than she is . was she one of the players you watched a lot , and what preconceived notions did you have about what it would be like to play against ? and how was it once you did it ?
are you surprised by her power ? she has such a petite frame . especially her forehand . never used to be such a weapon . any surprises ?
we 've become somewhat accustomed to women 's matches in which it 's a question of who 's going to hold , not who 's going to break . but this was a little bit different . you both held your serve reasonably well throughout the matches . is it the quality of your serve , do you feel ?
for someone who 'd been off for 18 months and went to the finals of the australian open , does it surprise you the level of play that she has at this point ?
your tennis today was definitely showing a side that 's much more aggressive and you 're hitting the ball and really moving into your shots very well and consistently . do you feel that that 's something that has helped you get farther into your -- i mean , you 're no.2 in the world right now .
she plays a high-risk game , almost like the williams girls . is that who you would compare it to ? she goes for it . did that surprise you in anyway , her high risk ?
talk about in general how the tour is more interesting with her and kim back compared to before . it 's two more people that are definitely in the mix toward the end of a tournament as someone who 's competing against them .
in the second set up 3-2 , you went over for treatment . take us through what was going through your mind at that point .
looking at the stats , you have over 50 winners and over 50 unforced errors , what does that tell you ? is it that you 're playing more of a high-risk game ?
the match went almost three hours . after not playing that long , talk about that , being on the court that long .
were you surprised how she kept points alive for so long when they seemed won by and you they were still going ?
you have n't seen a moonball in a while , have you ?
talk your back a little bit . are you concerned it could flare up in the semis , whether it 's kim or ...
your backhand is the more spectacular shot , and people love it , but your forehand is effective , too . is that a general trend .
when you walked away for 18 months and you were no.1 , you cited part of reason as being burnt out , if i 'm correct .
the way you were playing at the australian open and the way you 're playing now as a wildcard , are you rejuvenated ?
you call it your first career . do you really view this as a whole separate career now ?
talk about the possible reprise of your long-standing rivalry with kim . i think you 're up 12-11. you won most of the big ones . talk about how special that is and could be still for years to come .
has your relationship with each other changed and evolved over the years ? when you were juniors you were maybe more bitter rivals . is it still that way , or are you more friendly ?
is it difficult to come up with a strategy when you face a player for the first time ?
a little bit easier today than yesterday ?
do you feel you 're the player to beat here ?
were you a little bit worried at all the about the quick turnaround ?
when you and serena and probably kim and justine are at your best , do you feel like it 's hard for anyone to really breakthrough the four of you ?
because you 've missed because of injuries and things like that . do you feel like you 're happy with your career , or are there things that you feel that you missed out on because of that ?
there were a couple times that you were playing the second serve way inside the baseline . someone who is not serving nearly as hard as you are and does n't of that kind of power stroke , can they hang with you ?
were there a couple times she seemed - i do n't want to say scared - but maybe like intimidated with the serve ? she was almost like ducking out of the way . did you notice that as well ?
we talked the other day a little bit about how you have n't volleyed as much as many people , including billie jean , thought that you should with your wingspan and ability to move . is there something you get from standing in the back of the court wailing a ball that you feel like you 're gon na miss a few volleys and cut the point quicker ?
is that satisfying to hit a great volley ?
when will you make an absolute decision on fed cup ? after the tournament ?
i wanted to ask , there were a couple plays like i said when you came to the net you just did n't let up at all . most of the time it went in . a couple times it went long . was it kind of a change or a flow from yesterday where you felt like you had to be more aggressive and still kind of flowing in your veins like that ?
obviously you know marion bartoli after wimbledon .
what do you know about the other possible opponent ?
she 's yet another belgian . is it amazing to you ?
yeah . that there are so many successful belgians on the tour , not just kim and justine .
did you feel something like tennis vibration in antwerp ?
as you get closer to the finals , semifinals , do the juices get flowing a little more ? does it feel more like now the tournament has started ?
going back to the aggressiveness , you are at the net , you 're hitting an overhead - and you missed a few , but you 're hitting them like out of your mind , just that hard . does that frustrate you at all , or do you say , well , i 'll give it my best shot ?
i know you ca n't speak for serena , but have you discussed if she 's healthy whether she has an interest in playing fed cup ?
does she indicate how she 's feeling ?
you last played her in 2007 , and although you have a 9-0 record against her , it 's been a while . was there something different about her game today , or was it the conditions ?
tell us about the final game . it 's like you decided no more messing around . that was a pretty emphatic last game .
between the first and second sets , you said the first set you could n't really find the court and everything else . what do you tell yourself in between sets where you 're just kind of sitting there , kind of staring blankly , looks like ? but what are you telling yourself to get back on track as quickly as you can ?
so rather than just pulling back a little bit and trying to make sure you find the court , you just go harder ; is that kind of the game plan ?
what 's the mental challenge of playing somebody you 've beaten nine times without a loss ? what 's that like ?
i notice that you do n't call for on-court coaching . do you enjoy trying to figure out the puzzle on your own ?
when the coach did come down , he was basically telling her you come up big in these moments , and she kind of has to match what you can do . could you hear any of that at all ?
do you feel like you intimidate people even at this stage of your career when you 've done it for so long ? that you intimidate the opponent sometimes as far as in your ability to come up big in those segments ?
what does this match bode for the rest of the tournament for you ?
i think it was like the next to last game where you broke her to win . your serve was clocked between 115 and 119 every serve , and your groundstrokes - that they do n't clock - they were n't far behind . that was when you really started to up your playing ability . was there something specific that happened ?
were you surprised that she could match your groundstrokes ?
how did you spend the rain delay ?
was there something wrong with the shoulder ?
what was the issue ? is that from the beginning or ...
was it a strain ?
have you ever had any issues with that before ?
what kind of treatment are you gon na get ?
how many times was she out and working on you ?
three times ?
you played her last in 2006 in bali . was it something different ...
did you even think you were gon na get the match in today because of the rain ?
did the trainer advise you to stop playing or say it was up to you ?
will you go for an mri or anything , see if there 's a tear , or you just think it 's a pulled muscle ?
where does it hurt ? front , back ?
what 's your schedule ?
was it also because of the pain difficult to run and move and do all those other things ?
was it your last match you first noticed ?
so your other match , it was ...
i assume you 're not gon na play fed cup .
i know she said that you could come out at any time or retire at any time . when you were down 3-0 , 4-0 in the second set --
this is your first quarters here since 2003. how does it feel ?
tough conditions today ? wind ? the rain made it heavy ?
how much do you think her game was affected because of the shoulder issues that she was having ?
could you see ...
when did you used to practice together ?
you beat her for a junior title , right ?
you had a tough time this year so far . what 's been the issue you 've been dealing with ?
( indiscernible . )
you look much better than you did in the first set . please tell us what happened , how you got through that , and why you did n't quit .
were you dizzy at any point ? did you take something to make you feel better ?
is that all ?
did you have a flu or a stomach bug or do you know what you have ?
do you think it was hard for maria to play against you knowing she saw something might have been wrong , whatever , was hard to change tactics or thought you might not make it the whole match or whatnot ?
both being adidas girls , how well do you know each other ?
how close were you to retiring in this match ?
have you ever had your blood pressure taken on court before ?
how was it ?
what were your numbers ?
no dancing tonight , eh ?
i saw your dad was with you , dad and coach , obviously . what did he tell you ?
you made it to the finals last week at indian wells . do you think maybe also part of it is fatigue that you 're experiencing with a lot of tennis the last few weeks ?
how is your arrangement working out ? i mean , you go to las vegas a little with sven and gil reyes .
get plenty of rest , plenty of fluids .
can i have you talk about i guess the way it finished ? 5-2 , 30-30 there was a call that looked long , and then from there it seemed to have got a little tighter .
what was most troubling to you about her game ?
your first two matches , you 're treating your opponents rather rudely . i do n't think you 've lost serve or even come close to it . you must be feeling in a nice groove as you move along here ?
i notice against kleybanova , looks like she was trying to give you the match a few times . you did n't want it .
were you there mentally that match ? were you somewhere else ?
were you a little surprised today ? because she has had some game , obviously , through the years , but she did n't have much to give you today .
how did you get that mental difference ? did you see a sports psychologist ? did you talk to your husband ? play with your kid more ? how did you do it ?
how much time are you spending in new jersey ?
obviously your hometown is a small town . new jersey is like practically new york . how does that ...
so where in new jersey is it ?
wall ?
do you look at your draw ? to me , you 're in the tougher side of the draw . you have azarenka maybe next if she wins , wozniacki somewhere , henin somewhere . do you look at it ?
in terms of the matches you played this year , where would that one rate amongst your performances ?
today 's , yes .
how is it now traveling with a child ?
how many matches has jada come to ? is she aware now what you do and who you are ?
i read somewhere that you had a couple weeks off before the beginning of the tournament . how long does it take before your rust totally disappears ?
as of yesterday you were the only american woman left in the draw . it 's been happening more and more often . does it concern you that when you and serena finally walk into the sunset there will not be an american grand slam champion for years to come ?
do you see any light at the end of the of the tunnel ?
look like you were struggling with your serve . was it the wind or something else ?
do you prefer playing a tournament when serena is playing , or does n't matter anymore ?
16 trips to the net today . always love to see you come to the net .
we 've heard you say that before . is there still reluctance at times to come to the net ? where does that fit into your game at this point in your career ?
do you like it when you 're up there ? when you you 're up there , you like your chances ?
besides your ability , is it a way of -- i mean , you 've had injuries . you 're getting older . is there a way to speed up the game to take charge faster ?
what kind of feedback did you get on the dress ?
so the reviews have been favorable ?
how do you just describe it ?
during your match , dwyane wade and andy roddick were playing horse on the court , and tennis . trust me , andy looks a lot better playing basketball than d-wade looked playing tennis . i know you are a d-wade . you go to heat games . would you have liked to be part of that ?
andy had him down 3-1 in horse .
sandbagging , you think ?
he beat him with a shot from the floor . he went on the floor and banked it in .
you 've won when you 've had long breaks and won when you 've played a lot . when you 're on a winning streak like this , does it do anything in terms of your confidence or your level or anything at all ? you know , the impact , does it impact just the way you 're playing ?
where do you stand in terms of fed cup ? have you pretty much closed the door on that ? left it open ?
i do n't know . you have n't played in a while .
so are we going to see you in birmingham ?
have you told mary joe you 'd like to be a part ?
and she was receptive ?
but if she came to you and said , i want you to play in birmingham , you 're available ?
it looked like you framed a second serve . i 'm just wondering -- everybody is human , of course . you almost laugh out loud . do you roll your eyes , or what is the reaction ?
so what happened there ?
it just shows how hard tennis is .
that looked like a really comfortable game for you . was it ?
was it difficult to be on that court ?
tell us about the new outfit .
are we going a few - i 'm not good on fashion - but are we going back a few decades with that look a little bit ? are you drawing some from --
yeah , or even before that . i 'm not necessarily talking about tennis even .
it looks western to me .
like western , like wild west . old western .
do you have other colors for this tournament , or red all the way through ?
a remix ?
stay tuned .
how did you feel out there tonight ?
when you 're a little rusty , is the serve a part of that ?
but i mean , did you feel a little rust there more than ...
did you have a wrap around your --
what was it like here when you were winning all the time ? three years you played here , i do n't know , 20-some matches in a row . what was that like ?
you have tomorrow off ?
you planning to do anything tomorrow , or just rest ?
does the dog travel with you ?
you 're a heat fan , are n't you ?
have you heard about roddick taking on d-wade here on in horse saturday ?
they 're gon na play a little tennis , too , i guess .
congratulations . great match .
do you usually have that much energy ?
at the end there she was getting frustrated , obviously . can you talk about that ?
also congratulations on i guess most improved player . can you talk about your reaction to that and why you think you deserve that and what it 's like ?
how did you improve your focus ?
was it tough going through what you did ? i guess the last year or whatever it was with the drug stuff , was it even tougher to remain focused ? can you talk about that whole period ?
do you feel like that 's behind you ? what happens next in that process ?
here in miami , how far do you think you can go ? what are your goals here ? goals for the year ?
also , your mother , i guess , died when you were a young girl , nine . did you start playing tennis after that ? i mean , did she have anything to do with that ? did she ever play , or ...
i just want to know about your dad a little bit . is he your coach ? is he with you here today ?
how does it help having dad with you ?
i imagine you 're not thrilled with how you played today .
is her style difficult with two hands on both sides , topspin off the two-handed forehand ?
what made the difference at the end , you think ?
what did you say to yourself ? give us an example .
very mean ?
do you get mad in russian or english ? are you angry bilingual ?
seems like your forehand has been off lately . what 's going on there ?
do you think she played well in the second set ?
right .
do you feel more pressure after winning the french now that you 're putting more pressure on yourself ?
were you hurt at all when you fell ? seemed like you were walking a little funny . did you hurt yourself at all during the match ?
how do you like your chances here overall ?
i 'm doing something on the chinese women . they have three in the top 56 , li na and zheng .
i 've done that story for years .
do you see an improvement from these girls ? is it a mental strength ? groundstrokes ? what is it ?
you 've faced her twice before . is there anything different you see in her game this time around ?
talking about the russian women , i think there are 13 russian women in the draw here . are there a lot of youngsters coming through , as well , even though it 's sort of junior levels ? tennis in russia gon na be healthy ?
nice match today .
how do you feel in where you 're at right now in your game ? obviously you 've tripped up a little bit in the last , you know , six , seven , eight months . how are you feeling now ? you feel like it 's evening out , coming back ?
heinz gunthardt ?
great coach . when you look back a little bit , do you feel like it was a little bit too much too soon and it kind of overwhelmed you , either on the court or off the court ?
who do you feel was pushing you so hard ? was that you , your parents , your coach ? who was pushing you so hard ?
a lot of other girls were in similar boat as you . jelena jankovic had trouble after she reached no.1 ; maria sharapova to a certain extent . that was more injury-related , but jankovic also said she trained too hard . jankovic is coming back . do you see her win at indian wells last week as kind of a good thing for you to see ?
last question for the new me : your goals . i mean , once you reach no.1 , is it automatic , i have to be no.1 again , or do you have other goals ?
you started to get back into it in the second set , which was better . but she seemed unbelievably good a lot of the time . what were your feelings ?
could you have done anything different ?
yes .
do you still feel you 're on an upward curve this year ? the results would suggest that you are .
you must have been asked this dozens of times , do you set yourself targets , or rankings or goals , or how do you look ahead ?
you 're clearly coming into your prime at 26. i know you 've had a long and winding road to get here , but do you think there 's going to be a shift in the women 's game like we 've seen in the men 's , the players peaking later physically than they have been ?
what i meant was , i mean , hingis , as you said , was very good at even 14 , 15 , 16. you do n't seem to be seeing that now . is it because you need this sort of physical strength to live with people like wickmayer and the way someone like that can hit the ball ?
i think she 's 20 .
have you seen any changes in the way that the women 's game is covered in the last sort of seven years ? i was talking to a player the other day who was complaining about anna kournikova syndrome starting off the whole skewing of placement on courts towards women who are more attractive than not . i wondered to all extent if you 've felt that as a tennis player ?
you 've talked a lot about nino in recent months . is his main contribution motivation ? if not , what are the other things ?
you still have to take loads of pills and all that sort of stuff ?
i 'm sorry .
what are you going to do between now and the french ?
are you still having fun ?
speaking of elena , the other day she said when she played you in australia she did n't know what to expect . obviously the backhand has never gone away , but she was surprised by your forehand . today you hit a big winner on a cross-court point . have you beefed up your forehand at all ?
we were pelting elena with questions about whether she felt unlucky having drawn you twice early . i 'll turn that back on you . do you feel unlucky in having drawn her this early ? but at this point in your comeback , does it matter where you play the top players ?
are you happy with your game today , justine ?
match point , overhead , whiff ; what happened on that one ?
did elena show you anything new since , before your comeback ?
did you find a different game when you came back and you 're in the locker room and saying , who are all these people ?
you and kim obviously , many grand slam champions , kim 2 , you 7. great comebacks . right away you both had success . there is another woman on the tour coming back . kimiko date took 12 years off . she won her first-round match today . are you amazed by her ? can you see yourself in 12 years playing ?
yanina received the wta 's most improved reward today . that 's probably not too much of a surprise . i wonder if you could just comment about her emergence on the scene .
yes .
did you find any differences in jill craybas ' game today than when you played her years ago ?
are you comfortable again , do you think , or do you think it 's gon na take some time after you came back to be comfortable ?
do you think that 's actually harder than the physical comeback , is the mental , emotional , all the stuff you 're talking about , the lack of privacy ?
nothing at all ? did n't run or ...
is it hard for you to look and see your name next to no.33 ?
you do n't pay any attention ?
do you feel the drive , desire , that hunger that you used to have ?
to win ?
when you missed that overhead on match point , is that something you just laugh at , it 's a one-off , or a little bit of a sign of , hey , it 's gon na take some time to get everything ...
how can you explain your terrific start , then , in australia ?
being a woman i think i notice a ring on an interesting finger .
thanks for clarifying .
was there some cathartic moment that made you come back ? was there some day , some thought , something you saw that made you come back , or was it a gradual thing ?
how was your first day back on the practice court after not doing any sports for all that time ?
what was the key to your victory today ?
in what way did your experience of being in the wimbledon final maybe be a help to you in this tournament so far ? and looking ahead to tomorrow , how might it help ?
it seems to me , having been in most of the press conferences , if not all of them in these last two weeks , that you are emoting tremendous confidence . i feel that from you . is that a fair assessment of the way you 've felt in this two weeks ?
what are your emotions right now ? are you happy ? what ?
what does it feel like to be at this stage of the competition again in another grand slam ?
right now you do n't seem to be very , very excited , but normally you are someone who emotionally gives a lot to the public , to the crowd . i 've seen sometimes crying , sometimes smiling . i mean , what do you think is better , weakness , or is it strength to be very emotional ?
which match provoke you more emotions if you can remember in the past ? which one shocked you a little bit more than others ?
last year you were very unhappy leaving the us open , what is the different circumstances between last year and this year in terms of your emotions and your ability to play so well at a high level ?
were you asked about the strings ? you broke a lot of strings in the match .
can you say what happened ? has it happened before ? did you actually take your coach 's racquet ?
have you ever broken that many strings in a match ?
you mentioned you only look ahead . we do n't know who your next opponent will be , so starting with the possibility of playing with kim , a person you 've beaten the last two times you 've played , both in three-set matches , can you give a preview of what that match will come down to if you play her ?
against venus , if you play her , a person you have n't beaten in seven years , how would you describe the challenge there ?
i know you do n't want to look back too much but it 's pretty amazing when we look back at that vision when you 're hitting your knees on the court and tears are flowing in this us open . for you to bow out in the round of 16 there and now in the final is pretty amazing for us . is it amazing for you ? can you sum it up ?
wozniacki today made a lot of unforced errors , a lot more than she usually does . how much of that was to your credit , do you think , and how much of her level was just below ...
if you had to go out for dinner with a russian tennis person , which one do you choose between the women and which one do you choose between the men ?
pick one .
yes .
what happened out there today ? seemed like she played almost a perfect game against you .
taking into account how incredibly well you 've played coming into the tournament and then in the tournament , does it make it that much more difficult to not get to the finals in that your expectations were , i 'm sure , pretty high ?
seemed like you were missing a lot of forehands .
were you not feeling it today ?
you 've had a real long run . are you tired now ? are you feeling weary ?
how bad were the conditions out there for you today ?
you said you made mistakes . are you talking physical mistakes , like mishitting a shot or are you talking mental mistakes where you 're going for something here and you should n't have .
you played her four times going into this match , now five times ; is this the best she 's ever played against you , do you think ?
she 's known for being mentally fragile . were you surprised at how well she handled - i mean , the string thing was bizarre there in the second set - did you think , well , this is the place where maybe she 's gon na crack a little bit ? she did n't .
this is her second grand slam final this year , and she did not make the breakthrough at wimbledon . what do you think will be the issues for her , do you think , in order for her to win it , you having played a final here last year ?
what are going to be the decisive things , you think ?
she hits those flat groundstrokes that stay low to the ground . is that especially difficult on a day when you 're not really in sync with your forehand , or like you said , you 're not really feeling it ?
what was the difference in your game today , shot making , serve ?
can you describe the feeling of chasing down that lob she hit on breakpoint in that second to the last game ? how good a lob was it ?
do you think that lob was going to land so far out and you could n't get it , and then realized you might have had a shot at chasing it down ?
you seemed to hesitate for a second there at the net .
we 're talking about the same point .
but you do remember sort of lunging up , trying to grab it out of the air and grabbing it after it already bounced ?
you did n't play all summer . were you running out of gas there after such a long layoff ?
were those two double faults in the tiebreak because of the wind or nerves or a little combination ?
how much pressure did you feel coming into this match today ? did it raise as the match went on ?
what 's next for you ?
every loss is disappointing , but knowing your age and all the years you 've played , is this perhaps more disappointing than some of them , or do you feel like i 'll be back next year ?
so it sounds like you 're somewhat pleased with your run here at the open . what are your takeaway thoughts from the tournament ?
your schedule before , you did n't say anything about fed cup . since you 're playing italy maybe , are you going to go or maybe not sure 100 % ?
will you be there , because it was also last year ?
do you feel like you proved something , that at 30 you 're still a contender for titles and people should n't forget you 're still up there at the top ?
could you tell she gained some confidence at the end of the tiebreak ? did you feel her settling more into the court after that ?
was there any moment where you felt particularly comfortable , especially with the way you served through the first set ?
being that you both had to account to the wind , what did she do that was different , so different than what you did ?
obviously they apply to both players , the conditions , but the heat , the cool , the wind , is this the worst , most bizarre conditions at a grand slam ?
what 's your overall frustration with getting as far as you did and not being able to close it out ?
could you talk a little bit more about the fed cup , playing for your country , playing for mary joe against the italians and francesca , et cetera ?
one thing it 's difficult to understand is why you have lost sometimes to pennetta and never to schiavone when everyone thinks that schiavone is stronger .
did you run out of dresses ?
could you talk about the backhand topspin lob and your decision to hit that shot there ?
were you thinking about the wind on that shot ? were you thinking it might sit up in the wind a little bit ?
it was such a roller coaster . you 're up 5-2 in the second , and then she storms back ; 4-2 in the third , and she storms back . what 's going through your head as ...
you were up in the second , right , when she came back ?
5-3. i will check my notes .
you were up a break . you were up 5-2 .
so i guess you were thinking ...
can you remember a more challenging grand slam in terms of conditions , wind ?
how hard is it to fine tune your game every two games ? you cross the net and you have to make fine changes in what you do with the ball .
takes away the instinct from a player . you ca n't just react . you have to factor in what you 've already made your mind up , the way the wind is blowing , think about it .
how do you feel to be in the finals again ? what does it mean that you had to get through venus williams ?
last year your run here was unexpected and incredibly sweet . what is it this year ?
what are your memories from your first match against her back in '01 , and how different of a player are you ?
against venus .
you were taped up , i remember .
you have such a great record at night here . you talked earlier in the week about it being a different atmosphere . but how do those differences play into your game , your personality , or whatever ?
did you feel tired in the third set at all ?
compared to when you retired , do you have perspective ? you have a child now ; you have a daughter . do you care or do you care more that you 're competing for this title ? does winning mean as much as before or less ?
were you surprised about how much support you got out there ? you 're playing an american . seems to me like you got about 50 % of the support .
what are you expecting from vera tomorrow ?
crazy , crazy kind of weather out there today . talk about the match and the conditions , how you were able to prevail .
you 've had such great success at the majors this year , been so consistent in the majors . do you find yourself at a point where you 're as confident as you 've ever been playing in the big championships ?
if you have a matchup with - we do n't know yet - but with caroline , you 've been 50/50 with her . you 're pretty evenly matched .
with how many unforced errors she was making , you were talking about being balanced and aggressive . were you trying to be a little bit more patient because of the errors she had been making ?
what did you learn from the match against flavia last year ?
what 's it like to compete in this tournament without serena being here ?
how important is it - if you have to play caroline - not to get frustrated , because it seems like she makes everyone play patiently ?
will experience matter for you , or do you think that caroline has enough experience now where you being on the tour longer and being in bigger matches is all that matters to you ?
what happened in your final in montreal ? did you get frustrated there ?
what does it say about yourself that you were able to reach two grand slam semifinals in a row this summer ?
which was tougher for you to deal with , the wind or vera ?
can you talk a bit more ? it seemed like the wind was very tricky today .
it looked like you were getting a little frustrated . were you frustrated with yourself or the conditions ? where did that come from ?
you had 60 unforced errors . do you think that was mostly as a result of the conditions , the wind , or were you taking a lot of chances ?
toward the end of the second set you came back from losing love-6 the previous round in the first set . looked like you had the break points . were you thinking , okay , i can pull this second set out and force a third ?
making the quarterfinals of the us open , how happy are you with your overall performance ? obviously you had some big wins in the third and fourth rounds .
how would you assess vera 's play ? how do you think she played today ?
what are your plans from here ? what do you yourself term as a successful tournament ? what are your plans from here on out ?
what are you gon na take away from your successful tournament here ? what do you think was the best part that you learned about yourself making it this far ?
how tough it was to play under that kind of windy conditions ?
was the wind consistently in one direction or was it just unpredictable ?
maybe now obviously you might be disappointed , but looking back on this tournament , are you satisfied with the way you played ?
when you have a match like the querrey match before you and it takes four and a half hours - you 're expected to go on at 3:00 and you go on at 5:00 - you 're sitting around for all those hours , what goes through your head ? how do you keep yourself pumped up in the pregame ?
do you do anything in particular while waiting ?
francesca was just talking about the windy conditions . she comes into this match playing very , very high-quality tennis and you dispatch of her in two straight sets . she was particularly complimentary of your serve today . if you could reflect back on the match and tell me what you think .
she said in her press conference that you do n't like playing her . i do n't know how she garners that , but that 's what she said .
she said the reason was she pushes you to the wall ; she shows you a lot of things that other girls do n't ; is that true ? do you not like playing her ? does she present certain challenges to you that , you know , that stand out ?
you 're 7-0 against her .
i pointed that out , too . you come in , you 're 7-0 against her over the years . you come into the match , and she was playing very strong tennis in this tournament and obviously earlier in the summer .
what were your thoughts coming into the match facing her ?
can you compare the strength of this field in comparison to maybe past opens ?
you and sam querrey , the last two american singles players , you 're both back-to-back on the same court . he did n't escape ; you are going on . do you have any comments about that ?
you 've been here before , obviously , but do you feel any responsibility ? they were asking him , you know , like i 'm carrying america 's hope now that you 're the last one ?
what were you doing while you were waiting ?
kim just won the first set . if she does happen to go on and win the match , are you looking forward to playing her , defending champ ? can you assess that match a little ?
what are the tactics involved when you play kim ?
what are your observations of kim as a player and a person ?
what are her unique attributes on the court ? what makes her different from other players ?
you 're now one match victory away from getting back to the us open final for the first time since 2002. what would it mean to you to get back to that stage ?
considering your success earlier in your career here on this court , are you surprised it 's been this long since you 've won ?
the first set was very close , and the last set just was n't as close . what do you think you did differently between the start of the match to the end of the match that allowed you to excel so well ?
how has your knee been ? you talked about it earlier . your dad said he was a little worried . how 's your knee ?
so physically you 're okay ? you had issues at some point , like getting back . so your condition is pretty much better , physically 100 % ?
how much of that played into this game that just happened with schiavone ? i know you said she always gives you a good fight that other girls do n't . how much of that physically did it affect you ? and mentally how do you get into the next match ?
did it give you a chance physically saying , you know what , despite her competitiveness , i 'm walking , physically i 'm good ?
a lot of people talk about how you do n't see 14 year olds or 16 year olds play at the top of the game in women 's tennis these days or the last couple of years . what would you attribute that to ?
if sam was to turn this match around and you 're playing her , look ahead to that possibility .
could you first just start off commenting on your thoughts on the match ?
when you consider how well you were playing in the tournament , you 've had four straight-set matches , pretty dominant performances , can you talk a little bit about your expectations coming in ? can you look back at this point and say , hey , it was a good tournament ? do you feel you were playing good enough you could win today ?
you were down 4-0 in that first set tiebreaker , and then you came back with four straight points to tie it up . what happened from there ? kind of got away from you from there .
it 's the end of the grand slam season . the grand slam season is over now , and you 've had an incredible rebirth this summer or even breakthrough . i 'm just wondering , what does it feel like now this summer ? to do this so late , is this like a dream ? was it something you saw coming ? do you feel like you can step on it and use this foundation to go forward ?
you have n't beat her in seven meetings . coming into this match and considering how well you were playing in the tournament , can you talk about your expectations in terms of facing venus , and is it that much more disappointing to lose this one ?
is that the case then tonight , that she was just better ? is that what you 're saying ?
was it different for you this tournament to be here as a champion , did that inspire you ? did that affect you ?
you said that the wind was a problem . was the temperature also an issue for you ?
you said on tv there 's so many players that can win the tournament . do you really believe that or do you think there 's three or four strong favorites ?
but if it 's unpredictable , are you surprised you 've reached the quarterfinals ?
what about kaia kanepi ? what will you have to do ?
if i recall correctly , a tough injury in charleston , a run at wimbledon , then here . are you thrilled by this ? are you a little surprised by it ? is it the result of a lot of hard work ?
at what point can you , as a player that 's been around for a while , sense that a young player with potential , like wozniacki , can actually come to a grand slam , not get nervous and beat a player like sharapova ? sometimes young players play a veteran player and they ca n't handle it emotionally .
a lot of tennis , many people say , is about belief , inner feeling . can you imagine yourself lifting the trophy a week from saturday as the winner ?
has your schoolwork in any way helped you as a tennis player ?
are your studies on hold now ?
can you do any of that online , or is it all in person ?
the courses you 're taking ?
which ones are you taking now ?
you said after wimbledon that you felt like you rushed too much mentally in the final . is that something you 're going to try to be careful about here , not to rush through your games ?
how do you prepare each match and with who ?
no tactical ?
she had like 36 unforced errors to your 10 , 9 double-faults . do you think she kind of gave a lot of the match to you , it would have been a tougher match if she did n't make all those errors ?
in what way is your game different this year than last year ?
did you go out there today knowing you would win or you could win ?
you had a 29-shot rally . you like that type of tennis , just slugging it out back and forth ?
your next opponent is either 5 ' 2 '' or 5 ' 3 '' , depending on who you believe will win . how old were you when you were 5 ' 2 '' ?
how would you describe what your strategy was today ?
you seemed to hit a lot of balls into the center of the court . you were n't really going for lines that often . that 's part of that strategy of prolonging points ?
there was one point where you came to net and fell down , let out a big smile , the crowd cheered . what was going through your head ?
last year tennis fans knew who you were . maria sharapova is a household name . now that you 've beaten this household name , do you find more endorsements , less privacy ? how has your life changed in the last year ?
do you have more big-name corporations calling you , you 're recognized on the street , a loss of privacy ?
do you think this is a match you would have won one year ago ?
when athletes in any sport reach sort of a peak , they have a confidence like nothing can stop them . have you reached that , where you 're in a zone at all ?
would anything but a title at this point be a disappointment ?
one of your guests was wojtek fibak , the best polish player from '70s and '80s . did you have a chance to talk with him after the match ?
how does that compare to the last time you played against maria , this match ?
two years ago , 2008 .
i think it was rome .
what does it say to you about your mental toughness in tough conditions and against a player who is known so widely for her mental toughness that you made it through ?
how important is it to look good on the court for you ?
in this case , do n't you think it 's a bit short , your dress ?
what went wrong exactly ? your first set could n't have been more perfect .
did you see her changing her strategy in the last two sets ?
even in the second set , did you still feel confident like you were in control ? did you feel it was slipping away ?
is it disappointing , particularly after last year ?
36 unforced errors , 9 double-faults . do you think you kind of gave the match to her ?
what is she doing especially well ?
when was the last time you can remember double-faulting three times in a row ?
were you surprised that she played so fast and so stable ?
how far do you see her going in the tournament ?
you held your serve pretty easily at 3-2. the next two , three games you lost your range . did the wind pick up ?
the second set .
what are your thoughts on the state of your game now , your return from the shoulder problems , what you foresee down the road ?
what kind of feelings do you have in your body after a match like this where you kind of can blame yourself for losing it ?
what kind of feelings do you have ?
for you was it a case of lack of execution or a case of lack of aggression ? what do you think was the reason you lost ?
it appeared you were trying to execute more aggressive game plans . there were times that the serve let you down , the forehand , too . want to talk a little bit about that .
do you feel it was just a lack of aggression or was it sometimes just on execution ?
how is she a different player from when you played her in the past ?
you 're going to play the asian season . what is the goal ?
who is now your favorite player for the victory of the tournament ?
do you think francesca schiavone has any chances against venus ?
how did you feel about this match ?
what was the thing that was the most interesting or difficult about being out there ?
stimuli ?
what happened when you were leading and after she came back ?
at the end of the second set you were in better shape ?
do you think cibulkova is a very , very good player ? what do you think of her ?
her game was difficult for you ?
do you find that the game for women has become more physically demanding ? you know , is there a lot more pressure , do you think , for women to bulk up at the gym , for example ? and do you think that women who do build themselves up and bulk up , do they have a better chance of performing at a better level than those , you know , leaner sort of girls ?
all of a sudden the match turned around . can you explain what happened ?
what happened in the first set then ?
and then the third set ?
what was the key moment , in your eyes ?
at that point did you think there was no way you could turn it around ?
do you consider yourself a player who can usually get an ace when you need it ? was it a surprise you were able to get those like that ?
must be quite satisfying . you 've now knocked two big seeds out of the tournament .
do you feel different to wimbledon ? you were in the quarterfinals of wimbledon this year . are you feeling in the same kind of form as you were back then ?
what made you choose tennis ? is tennis really big in estonia ?
what surface did you grow up playing on ?
what sort of reaction do you get back home ? does everyone recognize wherever you go ?
everybody is getting a bit crazy about the results back at home , are they ?
is it fair to say that you 're lacking a bit of regularity ?
thoughts if you play zvonareva ?
do you remember , have you won a match before when you lost the first set 6-0 ?
you went from winning one game to winning the match . were you thinking , maybe this is not going to happen today ?
did you expect to be in the quarterfinals of the us open ? did you think about it ?
were you injured ? you were wearing a wrap .
what you like to play against zvonareva or petkovic ?
what can you say about zvonareva ?
does your game style suit her ?
do you have a ranking goal ?
you had to come back from injury before . what did you have exactly ?
it was a huge win . what do you think the key was ? looked like you really used your speed and consistency against her .
did you come into this tournament thinking you could make this kind of a statement or is it a bit of a surprise for you ?
she obviously is an extremely talented player . what does it mean for you to do this against her here ?
how would you describe your playing style and your strength for someone who is not perhaps too familiar with your game ? for someone who is not too familiar with your game , how you would you describe ?
you 're facing sharapova or wozniacki in your next round . what are your thoughts on that match ?
who would you prefer to meet ?
you 've lost the last four meetings against caroline wozniacki , the last one in new haven a few weeks ago . what is it that makes her so difficult to play against for you ?
did you play against her in juniors ?
do you remember the first time you played against her ?
same kind of player then , or have you seen ...
of course , yeah .
does your mentality or your state of mind change against the big players ? you beat sharapova at the french . you seem to get up for those players . do you do anything different against them ?
could you talk a little bit more just about being short ? is it a pain ? is it a drag ? do you sometimes see it as an advantage ? do you get some joy from it ? just talk about that .
being short .
is it a little tougher , though , against a somewhat defensive player like wozniacki ?
were you planning to be that aggressive before ? or as you saw the way she was playing , did that make you want to be even more aggressive in your plan ?
you 've obviously always had the talent and game to take down almost any player , these big-name players , and you have the sort of attitude to take them down . have you reached a point of impatience where , say , look , i can do this ; i know i can beat them ; it 's time for me to make a grand slam ; i have to make my move ?
a few matches down now after that long layoff . what are your thoughts now after this tough match ?
how much did your success when you came to the net make you think , i should be doing this even more often ?
are you surprised that crowd was so supporting for your opponent ?
there was a story in the new york times earlier this week about you being 30 and how crissy and martina are the only players over 30 to have won multiple majors . can you just talk about that a little bit ? how different is it for you now at 30 than five or ten years ago , and are you motivated to try and win a couple of majors after 30 ?
do you feel old , or do you feel young when you 're around the other players ? do you really feel like you 're much older than everybody and more experienced ?
sorry about the ridiculousness of this question , but they were making a big deal on tv about you tugging at your dress . you just did n't seem comfortable out there . i know it was windy , but was the dress bothering at all ?
speaking of your sequinned tennis dresses , i think they 're gorgeous . it 's become the talk of the open . what color are we gon na see next ?
what happens to the old dresses ? like do you store them somewhere ? put them on a wall ? honestly , are they just gone ?
do they become rags that you use ?
when you 're in a major , does the psychology of what you 're doing change at all as the tournament goes ? do you start smelling the finish line or ...
how much more do you know about what you can do here now than you did when the tournament began because of the injury that you had ?
when you were standing up for shahar in dubai last year and beating her this year in dubai and then playing her again , seems like your lives have become intertwined .
she said you seemed to understand what she went through . can you talk about that , why you can empathize with what she went through ?
did you have a hard time deciding whether or not to pull out of that tournament a couple years ago ?
i interviewed patrick mcenroe last week about his book , and in it he talks about you and serena . he wishes you 'd be better ambassadors for the game of tennis . he said to me that he thought you were doing better because of the work you 've done as a player representative on the tour . but i wonder if you want to respond to that , doing better ?
right . what do you think of him saying that he thinks that you should be a better ambassador for the game ?
what are your thoughts on your next opponent and the keys to that match ?
you have had great matches this year , and a couple not so good . what can you do when you 're having one of those bad matches to stop the momentum going against you ?
you do n't alter the strategy mid-match or ...
do you enjoy the challenge , the spin that she puts on the balls ?
does the hard court neutralize that somewhat or change the game obviously ?
seems like you 're playing very freely at the moment , mentally and physically . do you feel that way or not ?
in france , you said that you tasted the court . it was better than spaghetti carbonara , i believe .
what do our american courts taste like , or have you tried that yet ?
what are you starting to feel now ? this is the second time you have been in the quarterfinals here .
but it 's not enough yet ?
you 've just met with one of the russian rising stars . what do you think about russian tennis future ?
i do n't mean to put you on the spot , but you said you do n't want to write history , but was there ever a better moment ...
well , i will say that again . thank you for clarifying that .
but just if i could follow up , do you think that your chapter in paris was one of the greatest in the history of italian tennis ?
new york has a very big italian-american population .
have you been treated as a great hero here ?
how do they ...
i assume you grew up on a clay courts at home . how did you get so good on a hardcourt ?
with your spin ?
do you think right now you 're finding a better spot to deal with the pressure or the expectation from the whole country compared with wimbledon ? you lost in the first round . i think at that time the pressure was on , right ?
there is the wimbledon of the opera world , la scalla . have you ever gone there ?
how does it compare to the special feeling you get at centre court in wimbledon ?
there 's a special feeling for the performer there ?
did you know who louis armstrong was ?
did you ever hear it , like it , his music ?
what was the opera ?
how did you feel out there today ? how were the conditions ? did you feel the crowd was for you or for venus or split ?
what sort of encouragement the way you played in the first set did that give you for your future ?
how hard have you worked on your serve to make progress ? how much more do you think you need to do to upgrade it further ?
what are your thoughts on venus ' level at this time compared with other times you 've played her ?
could you talk about your relationship with venus over the last couple of years , how it 's evolved because of the events in dubai .
do you have any feelings about whether players should have not played in that tournament because you were n't allowed in the country ?
you talked about how difficult the conditions were here . how about in dubai playing on that strange court , that makeshift court ? how difficult was that situation ?
how did venus ' support for you compare to the support of other players ? was what she did unusual in your mind ?
you and dudi sela were the only israelis in the main draw . a question about the future of israeli tennis . any up-and-comers ? what 's israel doing to invest in the next generation of israeli tennis players ?
despite the loss today , how would you rate your overall performance in the open this year ?
are you beginning to get the feel again ?
what were you nervous about ?
but you 've been on the big stage before , so you got on this morning and thought , maybe i 'm just not quite ready for this moment yet ?
has it given you a flavor to want to be on the big stage ? does it give you the appetite to drive , to get yourself further to where you want to be again ?
have you ever looked at a tape of the french open when you won it just to sort of see what you were doing then ? when you were having problems , and see if you could figure out something you could change ?
if you had played this match on a back court with no one watching as well as you 've been playing the last three matches , if it was n't on the big stage , do you think it might have been different ?
how would you assess clijsters ' chances of winning it all ?
maybe you do n't know , but in russia you have a lot of fans . what do you think about russian tennis ? maybe you have any russian friends in the locker room ?
what would make you happy at the end of the year after the championships is over ? what would satisfy you ?
anything .
you were no.1 ; then the tumble . were you saying to yourself , this ca n't possibly be happening ? what 's wrong ? were you questioning yourself ?
what were your problems with your belief , your self-belief ?
is this the happiest you 've been ? you seem not that disappointed considering , you know , you went out today . is this the happiest you 've felt on court playing tennis for a long , long time ?
last year , wildcard , nothing much expected . now you 're the champion . are there great expectations from you and your fans ?
you do n't seem to be playing like you 're under pressure as a defending champion . do you feel the pressure ? how do you deal with that level of expectation ?
when you came back , obviously you proved , you know , the comeback was the right thing to do by winning last year and proving something to yourself about it . do you have anything more to prove to yourself , or is this all sort of gravy now ? whatever happens is great , or do you feel that certain things you want to improve ?
when you were a kid , you and elena both played at the garden , madison square garden . what do you remember about those days ? and if you played her again , you know , what would you ...
i was surprised how relatively easy it was so far for you here today against a former no.1 . it did n't take you even an hour .
can you just talk about your potential matchup with samantha stosur . obviously you beat her quite easily already in the past . would you feel very confident of getting past her ?
are you starting to feel invincible here ? you 've won 18 matches in a row . that 's some record .
what can you tell us about the wind today ? it was pretty hard to play ?
you 've got this far in the tournament with the loss of three games . is that enough preparation to play sharapova in the next round ?
you said at the press conference before the tournament started that being the no.1 seed was not pressure , that you felt as though you deserved it . what do you think you 've shown so far ?
what will the matchup with maria come down to , do you think ?
you are always very consistent , and you are very good at court covering but not very aggressive , in my opinion . but recently i think you are playing very aggressive , attacking a lot . does it something you try to do , or does it come fairly natural ?
have you ever been on a hot streak like this before ? if so , how different out there do you feel ? do you see the ball a lot differently than other times ?
you played her a couple of times a few years ago . i guess it seems like a long time ago now , but will those matches have any bearing ?
you obviously have a great connection not only with new haven but with yale university and all the fun you 've had about that . i know you 're in the middle of a tournament now , but if you did have a chance to go take some courses there , what do you think you would like to take a course in ?
was the figure skater sarah hughes in touch with you ? is that correct , or is that ...
would you consider this match coming up a defining match for you ?
three-time grand slam champion , someone who 's won here before . you 're coming in as the top seed . i would think it would be a great victory if you could pull it off .
when you were a junior , was the whole maria image thing something that you thought maybe one day you 'd emulate ?
well , she 's the big nike girl . you 're now stella mccartney .
but what about on the court ? did you watch maria 's game ? did you see her win here in '06 or even wimbledon when she was 17 ? what did you admire about her ?
it 's said that one of maria 's greatest weapons is her mental toughness , and that along with serena she 's one of the best on tour . could you talk about your own mental toughness , how it 's evolved , and do you think that 's a strength for you ?
what do you think is the biggest difference in your respective styles of play ?
maria .
is there a pressure you have to win a grand slam , given that you 're ...
last year you had this type of matchup with a young upstart ; you lost . this year you pretty much dominated . what was the difference today ?
you 're probably going to play the no.1 seed on monday .
is it a disadvantage to come off of the 6-0 , 6-0 win going into that match and not being that tournament-tested in your last match ?
how would you describe the biggest difference between your style of play and wozniacki 's ?
is there ever any point in a match like that where you feel any mercy for the person on the other side ? how do you deal with that when you see that you 're just completely dominating this teenage girl on center court and all that ?
she obviously was quite overwhelmed by your game and the conditions and everything . but despite all that , were you able to see potential in her ? could you comment at all on what she might do well if she continues to work hard ? a bit about her game .
you 're 12 out of 14 since wimbledon . have you been on this type of hot streak before ? if so , what 's the difference now than when , say , when you 're struggling ? how do you see the court differently ?
what do you think you do better than caroline wozniacki ?
can it help you in any way that you have already won the us open ?
you 're regarded as one of the toughest mentally out there on court , if not `` the '' toughest . do you believe that in yourself ? also , how has the surgery and injuries since then , how have they really affected your confidence and perhaps showing you a little bit of vulnerability that you did n't have before ?
in your career , what moment are you most proud of in terms of mental toughness and coming through ? where do you think you have shown your toughness the most , including coming back ?
you said your type of game was different from wozniacki 's . what do you think the key of the match against wozniacki will be ?
it was n't that long ago , but do you think it 's tougher even now for a 17 year old to break in , to win a grand slam on the tour ? have things gotten progressively tougher for everybody ?
does it surprise you that there 's only one american left in the tournament , the bracket ?
so it does n't surprise you ?
not knowing how much tennis you watch in your spare time , how much have you actually see of caroline and her game in recent months ?
or recent years .
other tournaments ?
you spoke the other day about having a funny feeling when somebody says they look up to you because you 're so young .
how did that play out today in your interaction with capra ?
and your conversation with her at the end of the match , what was that ?
who do you think will win this tournament ? yourself or somebody else ?
can you just compare where you are now to 2006 , both physically and mentally ?
how bad was the wind and how did you try to manage playing into the wind when you were against the wind ?
how close to unplayable was it ?
seems like we always talk about conditions when we talk about the us open . is there anything that you think could be done to change things , or is it just the nature of this tournament ?
coming into this tournament , the women 's field just seems so wide open obviously with serena not being here . when you took a look at your draw , did you say , okay , this is my chance ? i know you 've been a finalist , but this is my chance to do this this year .
it was your ankle that 's been bothering you ?
when there is so much wind , it 's more a matter of mental because you get frustrated and nervous , or is it technical also issue ?
i know it 's real early for perspective , but are you able to share a thought about what you might take away from this whole past week and what you learned ?
did you feel the scoreline was a bit rough ? you got a breakpoint a few times . did you feel you deserved a couple of games here and there ?
how bad was the wind out there ? was it tough for you , 25-mile-an-hour winds ?
were you ever in that type of wind condition ?
had you ever been double bageled before ?
what do you need to work on ?
you 've had a taste of center court and center stage , really , this last week . what does that make you believe about your future ?
how has it changed the way you 're thinking about what 's to come and how you 'll approach it ?
you said something the other day about your plans for college . you 're putting it off a year to decide . can you explain that ? i did n't understand .
what are your thoughts on how you think that 's gon na go ? i mean , why would n't you just go to college now ?
can you describe sort of the very best of what maria does , her ability , compared to the typical player you 've played to this point ? is there a big gulf between maria 's power and ability to handle big points , or is it kind of a logical progression from the players you 've been playing ?
you said you admired her mental toughness . did you feel that toughness out there today ?
you probably envisioned as a kid , i 'm sure you imagined what it 's like on center court like this . can you talk about what you dreamed about compared to the reality of it ? what was it like for you compared to what you expected ?
maria has a reputation of course for being very loud . did that bother you at all ?
the other day you spoke about how much you looked up to maria and that you had never had the chance to meet her . can you describe any interaction that you had with her before or after the match today ?
what did that mean to you ?
a lot of people have been talking about a trend in women 's tennis that sees that right now we do n't have as many 14 years old , 18 year olds being able to take on the older women . the trend started with the williams sisters , and kim clijsters has talked about women returning to the gym , stronger , bigger women . what do you think of that trend ?
has crissy given you much advice ? and if so , what would you say is the best piece of advice that she 's given you ?
is all of this a little bit unreal to you in some way ? could you talk about that ?
along the lines of what she was asking about the bigger , more muscular women , i mean , did i understand that you gained like 20 pounds of muscle or something in the last -- have they tried to bulk you up in the last few years ?
can you talk about going forward ? will you be doing it even more ? do you feel like you 'll have to add more bulk ?
did you to talk to melanie before the match today or in the last couple of days ?
can you talk about your support system ? you 've mentioned the evert academy . you mentioned your family before and other players . can you talk about that ? because you seem very grounded , you know , self-aware and very positive . can you talk about who 's sort of behind you ?
a year from now , if some young player came to you and said , hey , i 'm going out on match for a big match in the third round , what advice would you give to her ?
john evert said something , other than the bulking up , you 're too much of a perfectionist and you 're afraid to make errors , and that they 're trying to get you out of that to be more just a little freer and more aggressive . can you talk about the evolution of that , your mentality , how you 've had to change a little ?
have you decides whether you 're going to play the juniors tournament ?
did you think power was the biggest difference out there today ?
you 've described your dad 's reluctance to attend your matches . can you talk about what his role was today ? was he here , and what he might have said to you afterward ?
your whole family was here . who was here ?
nobody from italy ?
you said something about one semester of college , and then you can go back . is it my understanding you went to college for a semester already ? i did n't follow that .
where are you leaning towards college-wise ?
what was it like to have your sister in the stands ?
you have n't faced a real tough test yet . can you still get a sense of where your game is at ?
do you feel like where you 're where you want to be at , considering the lack of preparation ?
after the long layoff , what questions did you have about how you would perform , how your body would hold up , and what questions have you answered with making it this far ?
what questions were in your mind about how you would hold up after that long of a layoff ?
at this point are there any lingering thoughts of shaking off rust ?
talking of the best , trying to perform the best you can , your outfit was really amazing . could you talk to us about why you had that beautiful outfit and top it off with a victory .
were there any thoughts about the hurricane raining on the parade ?
it passed us by .
when you 're in a situation where you have to compete in matches without having the time to prepare or ability to prepare , is there an aspect of your game that takes longer to come back , whether that 's footwork or a particular stroke ?
what aspect of your game did you feel helped you take control of the match tonight ?
so moving forward to the net , is that something you 're going to do on a regular basis ?
what are your thoughts on facing shahar peer ?
when she played serena , what impressed you most ?
we got to hear the audio from the player box after your first round . what do you think about that ?
have you gotten to listen to serena doing commentary ?
what are the plans as far as serena being at your upcoming matches ?
did you design that red dress ?
speaking of eleven designs , have any female tennis players approached you trying to rob some of your designs ?
how do you feel after that win ?
you said if you lasted a week you 've got your teeth in the tournament . is that how you feel now ?
given the previous years , did you book your hotel just for a couple of days , or did you go straightaway through the two weeks ?
you have been working on your movement ? you were talking the other day that you were moving better . it was really evident today .
you 're getting around the court better and running balls down . do you think that might be helping you eliminate some of the errors ?
how do you like your matchup with dementieva ?
you were down today . it seems really lower-ranked women have beaten higher-ranked women . what is it about the women 's game that allows for that sort of , i guess you can call it depth , but allows for that even playing field for players that are lower ranked in the world ?
you does n't see it that much in the men 's side . for women , is it the power of the men that makes it more difficult ?
do you think you have to work on something in particular ? because you looked frustrated a couple of times , banging your racquet . is there anything you need to work on more than anything else ?
that service game really seemed to spur you there . did you tell yourself to get really angry having done that ?
how were you feeling after your first-round match ? beyond just relief getting through , did you feel you could get to the fourth round , or did you have concerns at that point ?
considering your success at roland garros and a good run at australia this year , do you feel right now you are as poised as you 've ever been in your career , both mentally and physically , to get to semis , to get to a final , and to actually contend for this championship ?
do you feel as confident as you 've ever felt in this particular campaign where you are right now , as confident as you 've ever been in your career ?
does it spur you on with the aussie boys , oi , oi up in the stands ? does that spur you on , as well ?
does that put more pressure on you that you 're the only aussie singles left standing ?
what a shot . we saw roger do that shot a few times . a lot of people have been asked if they would do it . most have said they probably would n't unless it was a bizarre circumstance . talk about the circumstance that led to that shot .
had you done that in a match before ?
so you 're in the us open top five now ?

is it the first time ?
how many times have you done that before , and how much do you practice it ?
is this the best one of that type of shot ?
talk about the next match . what is your experience playing anastasia ? what are you anticipating ?
it 's a ways away , but could you take a moment and reflect on the fed cup coming up in san diego . you said before italy is fortunate to have two really good players , and how you love to play fed cup . can you talk about your feeling about the fed cup competition .
and what about your experience in san diego ? you played the tournament there , obviously .
and you must love the incredible emotion of fed cup . you seem to be so joyous .
could you talk about that a little bit , what tennis is all about to you .
would it be a particular challenge to face serena and venus ?
what other women have you seen make that between-the-leg shot ?
you had such a wonderful breakthrough obviously in paris . a lot of people might have expected you enjoy , sort of lose the rest of the season because you achieved this great thing . you really have seem to have reset yourself perfectly and are putting yourself in position again with another grand slam .
was it mentally difficult to get over that and get yourself ready for the hard court ?
so it made you hungrier ?
just describe how things were going out there , your mindset before you came into the game tonight ?
were you nervous ?
did you have the same preparation you usually do on every other game ?
was the weather condition okay for you ?
what did you make of her game today ?
do you feel like you 're playing yourself back into your best form ? you seem to be slowly getting back to where you were before .
was there a time when you thought it would not come back ?
you talked about the gusty conditions on ashe in your last match . today you played on armstrong . explain the differences in the two stadiums . are they similar ? different ?
it seems like from what i saw in cincinnati and these matches that you really know what you 're doing out there , you 're trusting your shots , you 're not panicking anymore . you have a lot more faith in your game , huh ?
is there any particular advice or something that heinz has worked on with you ? can you talk about his role .
what type of match do you expect with kim ? two former no.1s . how do you have to play that match to be successful ?
kim said she looks forward to the rematch ; that she hoped that you won . when she was off , she followed your career and likes you as a player . how do you feel in response to those comments that kim made ?
what do you think your emotions will be stepping out on ashe going out to face her ?
i know tennis is n't life , and you 've talked about that a lot . but how much happier are your days overall now that all the work is coming together and you 're actually winning ?
when you think of kim , what stands out ? what makes her as good as she is ?
you spoke in the past about some of the books you 've been reading . what have you been reading this summer ?
i thought you showed a lot of positive emotion early , the double fist pump . how important is it to channel the positive emotion ?
is it possible to dictate against kim ? there will be a lot of things going on in the match where you 're going to have to play a lot of defense , too .
back to the stieg larsson books . the main character , elizabeth salander , she 's a feisty character . do you get any inspiration from that ? she takes no nonsense from anyone .
can you just talk about the way you felt you played today .
you have sam in the next round . you 've beaten her more times than she 's beaten you in the past . do you take that into consideration going forward ? just talk about the matchup ahead .
how much relief is it when , with the bad weather forecast , to get your match done and know that you 're done and probably by sunday the weather will be good again and you do n't have to deal with delays or anything ?
you had this incredible streak of slams prior to wimbledon of nonstop slams , not missing any . how differently do you approach the slams looking back compared to when you were first breaking in on tour ?
is there more of a sense of urgency now , or do you not think of it that way ?
we see your mother as a coach , but how do you work physically ?
yes , fitness .
to what degree do you think you 're sometimes overlooked ? even here with serena out , other players are talked about so much as contenders for the title . do you think some people might be missing you ?
how bad as far as the respect for you and your game and the accomplishments you 've had ? do you think sometimes people sometimes overlook you ?
do you ever ask your mother to be a little more calm when she 's watching , or ...
does she know that she 's very good on television ? because she looks so ...
but did you notice the new camera in ashe at all today , the new playing camera that 's above the stadium ?
also , you 're aware that that 's considered a permanent fixture , apparently , so if you should strike that you lose the point ?
back to sam , her serve obviously is a big part of her game . has she got the best serve in the women 's game , except for maybe serena ?
caroline wozniacki , do you think she 's a different player now compared to the last year ?
you 've had some injuries this year . are you feeling right now injury-free ?
were you a little bit worried when you went down 3-0 ? far from ideal at the start ?
your serve , you were talking about it briefly on court afterwards . you were n't entirely happy . it 's something you have been struggling with .
have you noticed the flying camera on stadium court ? what do you think about it ? is that a potential distraction to you , or ...
well , it 's not moving around .
but it can be stationary over the court .
did you feel at all that you did n't get full credit for your win here last year because of the way serena lost ?
how much do you regret her not being here that you do n't have a chance to beat her again ?
and you do n't feel like your win got short-changed at all because of the way she lost ?
how much time do you spend in new jersey ?
can you compare sort of the traditional lifestyle in belgium with jersey life ?
finally , there has been a fair amount of talk about impact of marriage on court performance and play . you 've been married now for a while . how would you assess married life and its impact on your game ?
you alluded a moment ago to maybe not playing your best tennis right now and what you have to do to fight through that . how far from your best game do you think you are right now , and how far are you from the level of playing you need to go deep into the tournament ?
even in the best grand slam campaigns you 've had in your career , are you finding in those early round matches there is kind of a working out of the kinks ?
ana ivanovic . we do n't know yet , but she might be your next opponent . if that were to be the case , talk about that potential matchup .
it seems that in women 's tennis that the 14- , 15- , 16- , 17-year-old girl winning a slam is now something that people consider really shocking . used to happen fairly regular . do you have any idea why ...
on the flip side , do you think it 's also because a player like you might have just retired , took a break and came back , justine comes back , and all of a sudden you have players playing longer ?
what happens if you play against virginie razzano ?
yesterday during your doubles match you took a medical timeout immediately during the first changeover . what was that for ? were you feeling any ill effects from that today ?
how would you describe how things have gone for you and the feeling you 've had as the no.1 seed , which of course you have n't been here before ?
a lot of people are anticipating your match , potential match , with maria sharapova in the fourth round . do you look ahead in the draw , or ...
you played a lot the last month , and the weather here has been rather brutal for the first few days . have you been feeling any ill effects of the weather , fatigue or anything ?
you 've had two such easy matches so far . are you at all worried that you 're not match-prepared for maybe the tougher test later on ?
do you normally prefer to play a tough match early on , or does n't matter either way ? kind of get tournament test and had have that first scare or ...
will anything less than winning this tournament be a disappointment ? you just seem to be incredibly focused and pressure-free almost and heading right in that direction .
are you at all familiar with your next opponent ?
what does she bring to the table ?
we just spoke to her , and she described playing you like hitting a wall , just like everything comes back . i have to think that you 're at a point right now where you 're very intimidating to a lot of players . do you sense that ? how does that make you feel ?
this year in russia we 're celebrating 10 successful years in tennis . just want to know what do you think about russian tennis in whole , and maybe about last ten years of russian performances in particular ?
are you friends with russian players ?
can you talk a little bit about the frustration level you had after you got the ankle injury and then through copenhagen and pretty much when you came back and started winning again ?
do you worry that you might be playing too much because you played a lot from copenhagen through here , or are you the type of player who says , i need matches , this is the way i 'm gon na get my rhythm , and my body is just not gon na break down ?
the new york crowd tends to be loud and especially in the night matches . how does the atmosphere at the open compare to the other majors ?
how have your expectations of yourself changed from a year ago at this time when you were a surprise and you made the run to the championship match ?
but how much has the realty in your mind , the possibility of winning the championship here changed from a year ago to now ?
are you at all concerned a little bit about facing kim clijsters ? has that played a part of ...
has your level of confidence come to a point now where you feel like it 's only a matter of time before you win a grand slam tournament ?
pretty routine ? you did n't have to play great , but steady enough , served pretty well , good off the ground .
so second set , when you 're well in control , did you think , maybe i 'll try a couple things to use in the next round ?
what goes through your mind when you hear an opponent , even though you 're still young , having looked up to you since she was young as your next opponent spoke about earlier today ?
she spoke about your mental toughness as something she 's used as an example . that 's her strength , too . when you think about the example you 've set , what is your feeling about that ?
are you going to research or study tapes of opponents you 're not familiar with or just go out and play your game ?
what , if anything , do you know about capra ?
back to what you were saying about the little kids saying , i want to be like you . are you not the type of person that takes compliments and flattery well ?
do you shut it down and say , i know all my imperfections ?
did you ever ask anyone for an autograph ?
must have been some dinner .
in washington ?
you 're normally a crowd favorite . you wo n't take it personally if the crowd is rooting for your underdog opponent in your next match ?
michael jordan said the same thing . he never really asked certainly an athlete for an autograph . he did n't understand why you would do that , especially if you 're in the field .
i take it you did n't ask for autographs , but a couple courts over from you was martina navratilova and jimmy connors . i do n't know if you have any reaction to that .
how were the serves ?
service winner , an ace ?
did she come in behind it , backhand ?
when you were out at stanford , billie jean king was there , celebrating the 40th anniversary of that tournament . when you hear about the grass-roots beginning of the women 's tour , are you amazed how far you have come ?
what do you remember about last year 's melanie match here ? it was probably a low moment . what were some of the memories about that night ?
you and michael jordan are with nike . i take it phil knight does n't arrange parties ?
you 've had two really good fights . you 've come through both . do you look at matches like this as they can help you get stronger or would you rather get in and out ?
are you satisfied with your level or do you have to pick it up ?
not the first time you 've had to dig yourself out here early , huh ?
what is your enjoyment level out there ? in the first match , did n't seem like there was a lot of joy . are you having fun ?
the top seed here , wozniacki , she 's never won a major before . you 've tried yourself to be a top seed without a major under your belt . what is it like to be a top seed with those expectations not having won a slam ?
i do n't know . you tell me .
what did you think of her level of play ? were you surprised by the quality of play from her ?
we , in the media , are always judging the performances of all the players . let 's switch that around . what kind of job do you think the media does ? do you think we do a great , fabulous job telling your story or do we piss you off ? what do you think ?
do you think you do a good job in supplying us with the stories ?
yes .
tell us more about your house in san diego .
( question regarding ana ivanovic . )
did you watch janko 's match ?
how much do you know about his game ?
a couple of wins into a slam , is it tempting for you to look deeper into your quarter to see what potentially could be waiting for you ?
congratulations , and tell us your life story , please . ( laughter . )
you must have been pretty proud of how tough you played out there with her coming back and putting you in some tight spots .

what was it that you looked up to ?
what connection have you had with her personally ?
have you talked to chris evert yet ?
she was glued to the tv , she said .
she said she was glued to the tv .
i guess you met yesterday with billie jean and martina for a meeting . could you just tell us about that , and what , if anything , you took from that conversation .
what 's a power hour meeting ? i 'm not familiar with that phrase .
i mean , do you ask them questions , or do they just try to pump the younger players up ?
which question you would like to ask maria sharapova ?
yeah .
who were other players at that meeting ?
do you have anything inscribed on your sneakers ?
which part of italy come your parents or grandparents ?
have you been there ?
do you speak any italian ?
your parents , father and mother both ?
which name is ?
how much did you follow melanie oudin 's run here last year ?
take anything away from that ? would you like to seek some advice from her in playing sharapova ?
you mentioned before your parents . can you tell us a little bit more on the background , because the italians would be interested . when did you start ? when they came here ? what your father is doing ? why they left italy ?
can you go more into your story about leading up to this tournament ? what were you doing , for instance , a year ago today ?
what can you attribute to the sudden burst of like confidence , i guess ? why are you playing so well right now ?
where did your mom play college tennis , and at what age did she introduce you to the sport ?
is frank salazar still your coach , and could you explain just a bit about how much of your time these days you spend in delray beach and ellicott city and how that works going back and forth ?
do you still have an italian passport ?
ellicott city , tell us about it . big ? small ? dull ?
you 're at this crossroads with college . what will play into the decision of going to college , not going to college , especially having had a mom who played college tennis ?
how much did the crowd play a factor today ?
you 're very good off both wings ; played good defense . what do you think you 're going to need to keep building on this and be able to compete at this level on a regular basis ?
are you playing the juniors , too ?
did you have any dreams or did you imagine any sort of success here before the tournament started , and how did it look in those dreams are what you envisioned ?
i 'm sure there has been a lot of firsts for you , being in the main draw this past week , the player party and the locker room , and , you know , hitting on the courts with all the top players . is there one experience that 's just kind of rocked your world or just has been memorable ?
was it very hot today to play ?
congratulations on your book and your clothing . are you happy with the way things are going ?
did you have a toss issue ?
sorry for maybe a strange question . we in russia are celebrating 10 years of success in tennis . just want to know what do you think about russian tennis in whole , and 10 years of russian participation in particular ?
you now have played two matches after the two-month layoff . how are you feeling physically , and how far along are you in getting rid of whatever rust you may have had from that layoff ?
what is your level of satisfaction with how your body has responded to the demands of playing two matches , today under great heat and circumstances ?
what feedback have you gotten from serena , if any ?
did you happen to see what happened to azarenka this morning ?
she apparently had fallen in the gym .
there 's been a lot of conversation about the heat because the thermometer shows it to be very hot . this question comes up with a lot of the players here . we 're hearing that out there on ashe with the wind , it is n't maybe as difficult as one might think looking at a thermometer . would you agree with that ?
back to your book . it 's a fabulous book . have you ever thought about turning it into a documentary ? because i think it would be a great tool for kids in high school to learn about life issues and how to cope with that . have you thought about that or been approached ?
when a person who has won as many tournaments and games as you have in professional tennis approaches something like the us open , is it proven experience , training , or desire to win that gets you through ?
is there any different preparation that you have before a match when you know it 's going to be a very hot day like today ? does anything change ?
did you have a chance to see roger federer 's shot between his legs the other night ?
is that something you 've tried ?
two very , very strong performances to open up this grand slam campaign . do you feel very good about the way you 're playing and the way you played the last two matches ?
what about the conditions on the court ? they present a different set of challenges other than the person on the other side of the court . can you talk about that ?
the heat . the conditions on the court . the temperature . the weather .
hurricane .
are you happy ? you said nothing special . could just explain what you mean by that .
good way to begin ?
are you a big fan of that court ? it 's been kind to you .
no doubt you want to ask to play there every time .
it looked right from the beginning like you were a little bit tight . forehand was n't working . were you feeling tight ? did you ever get in your rhythm ?
do you think it 's a carryover from last year that people were so excited , you were so excited , a lot of expectations ? you said something like , everybody has one cinderella story . can you still go and be another cinderella ?
can you describe how you 're feeling right now after the loss .
as the tournament approached , once it started getting a couple weeks away , what were your feelings like ? were you getting pumped up and excited about it , or were you thinking it was going to be tough because of the expectations ? what was going through your mind ?
what do you feel like you 've learned from having this different of a us open experience and sort of over the last year , too ?
do you have a greater appreciation perhaps of some of the people at the top and what the expectations are on them and how they respond to it ? have you asked any of the other women what it 's like ?
is there perhaps a bit of an emotional relief at having gone through this cycle , i 'm back , i 've seen how this could go ?
technical question . you 're very quick and you have a big forehand . you do n't seem to run around the backhand too much to dictate the forehand . can you elaborate on your strategy that way .
how tall are you ?
how much hair did you actually lose ?
where you surprised that you were tight when you went out there ? were you surprised when you went out there and felt the way you did ?
do you still write `` believe '' on your shoes ? if not , when did you stop ?
what was the plan for the match against bondarenko ?
what is the biggest challenge for you being a married mother on tour ?
what do you think is the difference for a male or female married player on the tour ? do they have different challenges ?
what uncertainty did you have about your injury when you started the open , and what answers have you gotten by playing so far ?
how satisfied are you with how you 've made it through so far , and what do you feel about the outlook for the matches to come ?
is it a mental change that needs to be made to raise your level or a physical one or both ?
we were talking to sally . she met you , got her picture taken with you 10 years ago . it kind of left her in awe . do you have anything that is close to that in your history where you were playing somebody that you had posters of ?
sally was saying she did n't want it to end out there ; that she was having so much fun . what did you think of the way she played ? what are your opinions ?
when you were a younger player and involved with lleyton , did it ever cross your mind that no married couple had ever really excelled in pro tennis ?
did you get to meet patrick rafter , and what were your thoughts then ?
that seemed a very tight match with not a lot in it . what was the difference in the end ?
you must feel you 're playing , despite the loss , well at the moment ?
regardless of today 's result , you 're top 50 , thereabouts . if it is confirmed , what will that mean for you ?
how long has that been a goal for you ?
it obviously means something in terms of getting into tournaments and things like that . is it almost more of a psychological thing , i 'm one of the top 50 players in the world ? is that what it means in that sense ?
does today 's match show you , again , some of the areas where you have to step up ? the power she possesses ...
you spoke before about getting in the top 100. where do you think you could go ? is it smaller steps because of how difficult it is to get in the top 50 ?
the situation that anne finds herself in , she says , i 'm not the same player ; i 'm not there yet . when you have this opportunity , does it increase the need to grab it ?
what are your plans singles-wise after this ?
what happened out there tonight ?
what were you thinking in between sets during changeovers , especially after the first set ?
she was really attacking the ball through the entire match .
could be very troublesome serving . what goes through your mind when you toss the ball up to serve these days ? trying to think of some sort of image that i could describe as you 're staring down a break opportunity for her , she 's swinging at the ball , you hit some great second serves in the match .
do you feel like you 're playing well enough right now to win the open , or do you feel like you need to play your way into that kind of form still ?
which way do you prefer ? do you like to start out slow and finish fast or be fast the whole time ?
four years ago you won . you had the problems with surgery . does it make you feel , hey , i 'm back to where i had success ?
are you glad serena is not here or would you like her to be here to have the best here ?
somebody said you saw her foot the other night . did she show you her injury ?
what 's it like ? how bad does the laceration look ? did you actually see the laceration ?
what are your thoughts of the effectiveness of the hawk-eye system ? if there were anything you 'd like to change about it , what would you like to change ?
how much more confidence do you feel in your serve today than you did when we saw you last at the us open ?
how would you rate the status of your service game now ? are you confident in it ? still have a ways to go ?
the other day john mcenroe made some strong comments about women , the women 's tour , the schedule . could you tell us what your thoughts were on his point ?
he said basically women were not strong enough to play the full schedule and should have a shorter schedule than the men because they were not strong enough .
so you 're saying there 's a kind of core strength with the women athletes on the tour to sustain them through the schedule , that the women have a core strength as athletes to carry them through the schedule that they face each year ?
how do you feel about the way you played today ? how do you come out of that match ? happy ? satisfied ? worried ?
is there anything you take , being a grand slam champion , that is most important in your head about knowing how to win seven matches in a major that 's maybe an advantage over girls who have n't done that before ?
did you see roger federer 's trick shot last night ? if so , what are your thoughts ?
have you seen his video on the internet where he serves a can off somebody 's head ?
will we see you trying a between-the-leg shot anytime soon ?
it 's been a long time . must be rewarding . how do you feel ?
where have you been training ?
alicia was saying after she kind of came up with you , that she really respected how you sort of hung in there . what kept you going , and what sort of kept your sort of dream alive ?
what was the difference in the game ? you said you were losing matches . so why were you losing them ? was it a question of the power of the game or particular strokes that you could n't play ?
considering all you 've been through in your career , how differently do you look at tennis now ? do you have a different appreciation for the game ?
in your mind , did you quit ?
does it feel like a rebirth or a like a second coming for you , or how would you characterize , you know , how it feels to be back on tour ?
how much mileage do you think you have left on your body ?
are you a better player than you were in '99 ?
physically you did n't look that well-conditioned 11 years ago .
are you here with a coach ?
who is that ?
how have you been able to handle the off-the-court challenges , funding the travel , the coaching ? has that been a challenge for you ?
what kind of reception have you gotten from other players ?
melanie oudin last year had her big splash at the open , and with that success came all these expectations on her shoulders . can you relate to that in some way , in that when you first came on the tour , you know , you had steffi graf talking about you and people really putting some pressure on you ?
how hot was it out there ?
hot .
how does the heat affect your thinking , your movements , everything ?
when the draw came out and you found out that your first round opponent is kimiko date krumm , how much did you know about her , and what kind of a play did you expect from her ?
do you want to talk more about the type of play ? you said it was so different .
she seemed to change speed , spins , a lot more dropshots , that type of thing , than you see most of the time , which is mostly power now .
how did you turn it around in the third set ?
were you pleased with the way you played , particularly at the end ? you were playing more and more consistently .
how does that compare to previous years , like in 2004 , 2007 when you were here ?
did you surprise kimiko play so well , she so fit ? did you surprise ?
do you think you can play at this level at the age going on 40 ?
were you asked about the conditions out there , how hot it was ?
hotter than other times you 've played here ?
on the point of the conditions and the heat , are you happy with the rules that exist for taking a break if it reaches a certain temperature ? are there any additional rest breaks or rules that you think would be good for tennis to have ?
i think what they said on tv is that matches like yours that had already started before the temperature hit a certain mark could not take it . but at this point , you know , today , new matches for this afternoon will be able to take it , i believe .
you said it was very hot in russia and cincinnati . how did the heat today at its hottest compare with your other experiences of heat recently ?
you did n't play on ashe today , but can you talk about the speed of the court there ? do you think it 's faster on that court than some of the outside or other courts ? what 's the wind like in there ?
than ashe ?
what happened out there today ?
it did n't look like you had a lot of enthusiasm . was it difficult to keep grinding ?
but what about the confidence coming in here ? it 's been such a great summer .
what was the heat like ?
how hot was it , and how did the heat compare with other hot matches ?
you 've played in all the big stadiums around the world . is the wind in ashe the windiest , or where do you rank it ?
what are your thoughts about your next opponent and what she 's done with her career since she was a young player ?
mirjana .
are you familiar though with her determination to overcome injuries and the types of injuries she 's had ?
do you remember her at wimbledon in '99 ?
do you remember anything about it , if you were n't ?
do you come into this tournament this year or any of the slams this year with the same outlook that you 've had , say , for the last four or five years , yes , i can still win of one of these things ?
must be a bit of a relief to get through that one .
how are you striking the ball ? how are you feeling on the court ?
were you getting concerned ?
what about playing rodionova next ?
how is the arm ? it 's all right ?
when you finish a match , finish a training session , as far as the shoulder and all that is concerned , what do you do ? is it ice packs ? do you get massage ? what happens ?
did you have a letdown at all after the french open ?
what 's wrong with your shoulder ?
any chance that 's connected to your new strings ?
nice way to start off here . very quick match . do you feel like your form is really very strong right now ?
you struggled a bit since roland garros , but knowing you have been able to prevail in a grand slam tournament , does that give you an added sense of confidence when you come into a tournament such as this ?
do you like playing in new york , the people , the stadium ? is this a vibe that you enjoy ?
there 's no shortage of italians in new york city . do you feel you get a lot of support when you 're out there ?
how do you feel about a potential matchup with melanie oudin in the third round , should you both get that far ?
you were on top of the world in paris , and then you sort of came down . are you back to normal now ?
i want to ask you a big question about our sport , about tennis . in tennis , we 're just hitting the yellow ball back and forth , forehand , backhand . yet you said people came up to you and said that you gave them such beautiful emotions . what is it about the sport that can bring this beauty , these emotions ?
do you think people were attracted to you , to your game , because you took such risks , in the final , especially ?
and finally , which player attracts you the most ? if you could watch one player these days , who would that be ?
man , woman .
did you prepare any specific strategy coming into the match ? i mean , prepare some strategy against your opponent ?
you are kind of player who can mix up different kind of shots . you can hit the forehand and you can do anything . so as that kind of a player , can you give morita any advice ?
like , as you said , morita , she has very good groundstroke .
maybe her problem can be change the rhythm or ...
you think it was at all helpful to start on ashe stadium where you seem to have made a home last year ?
in terms of the season , so far in terms of losses , did this feel really good for the first time this year and dominating a match ?
you feel you 've made progress ?
what was the feeling like walking down that tunnel and you 're going to be out there in the ballpark that was all yours last year ? were you quite nervous ?
you were coming close to going to a golden set .
did you think about that ?
since you left last year , what 's been the one high point and the one not so high point ?
what is the one key thing in your maturing process this year ? how would you describe that or what would you point to ?
seemed like the whole match came down to one point when it was 30-all , and i think you were up 4-3 and going for the break . did you tell yourself anything before that one point ? i guess it was two points , 30-all and then the breakpoint which you won , and it was all downhill from there .
how much relief is mixed in with the fact that you won just to get this one out of the way ?
how did you come up with `` courage '' ?
do you write something on your shoe at all tournaments , or just at slams or just at the open ?
has your training and practice routine changed since last year ?
have you grown at all since we last saw you ? i mean physically .
you said recently everybody has one cinderella story in their life . yours was last year . but do you feel like you have a shot of getting back to the quarters or maybe even better this year ?
how different is it for you to come into this tournament considering what happened last year as opposed to the year before where you had only played once before and were out in the first round .
relatively unknown i think to the general public , and now that cinderella run . just talk about the difference of coming into the tournament .
what were your thoughts on john isner 's match at wimbledon and how he 's handled all of the attention since ?
how do you feel you handled last year 's success here , you know , after the open until now ?
seems like you spent a lot of time in the last year trying to tell people , look , do n't expect this out of me every week yet . did you ever have to tell yourself that ?
is there anything you like better about being an unknown ? is there anything you do n't like being about being the more famous melanie oudin ?
describe a little more about how is it different . how is it different being on the court as someone who is expected to win ?
you said you wished you wanted to be taller . do you feel like it is a disadvantage to be your height out on the tour now when you are looking up at most everybody ?
you chose the word `` courage , '' and in tennis there are lots of examples of courage from , you know , blake and ashe , the williams sister , monica , and so forth . is there an example courage that means a lot to you ? talk about that quality . what does it mean to you ?
is there an example , whether it 's isner at wimbledon or some of the others , of courage in tennis that you could point to ?
when you say buckle down on those late points , what do you do ? is there a routine ?
how does playing in front of a new york crowd at the open differ from the other majors our other places around the world ?
you talked about being nervous a couple times . what do you do when you 're out there feeling nervous ? and building up to it , how do you calm yourself down ?
how is becoming known because of what happened here last year affected your life off the court for better or for worse ?
do you have a favorite story from being recognized where you might not have been a year ago ?
how confident are you that this recovery of your game is a permanent thing ?
you kept saying some of the same things over the last year or so . did you ever doubt it yourself , thinking maybe it 's not going to come back ?
seems like you have switched your racquet to a new model . i do n't know if that gives you a reason you play good or not . does it suit your play style ?
how is your ankle ? does it feel completely okay ?
when you 're not confident , are you having specific thoughts like , i ca n't hit this shot ?
next round , your opponent you played twice before . how do you assess your next opponent ?
how did the rain delay help you ? you were down a set and a break , and you really came back and it was almost two different matches ?
when you came back out and held and then broke , the crowd was louder than i had heard them the whole match . did you sense that ?
right before the rain , you had fought off three match points obviously . it almost seemed like the momentum was turning and the rain delay could have hurt you .
did you notice any change in her game after her medical timeout , in her movement or in being more aggressive ?
were you trying to prolong some rallies to get her to move some more ? she played 6 consecutive days and played 12 sets . was that a key strategy for you coming in ?
you started out at 2-1 , and then she really went on a roll and kept that up , really , until the weather delay . was that more like you mentioned the pressure you were putting on here , or you were still trying to find your game today ?
you made your comeback here last year . is it especially special for to you win here this year ?
when you were down 0-3 in the tiebreak , did you see the match starting to go away from you at all ?
what does it say when you take a month off and come back and win a tournament right off the bat ? are you hoping to get a month off before every tournament now ?
your winners to unforced errors actually improved .
is that an indication that you 're timing and rhythm are coming back ?
you had a short match yesterday . can you talk about how long it took you to get into that rhythm today ?
with this win , you 're projected to rise to no.4 in the rankings . when you came back , is this where you expect to be a year into this ?
your a competitor and you really want to win , but it appears to everybody that you 're having so much fun out there since you 've come back . what are your expectations for grand slams now as opposed to when you played prior to your retirement ?
as no.4 , you 'll likely have your own quarter during the us open . does that make a difference to you ? i know you went in there last year unseeded . will it help at all to have the ...
did you get a little nervous trying to close out the match ? you had several match points . it was a big win for you .
you 're such a fast-paced player out there . is it tough playing maria who is possibly one of the slower players on tour ?
today the end of the match , jada came out and watched for a little bit , and she was yelling and cheering for you . how did that make you feel , and did it affect you at all ?
did the power failure upset your rhythm on your serve ? you had just broken to go 2-1 in second and lost your next three service games . kind of curious what happened there .
speaking of the light failure , has that ever happened to you before ?
what are your impressions of her game ? it was the first time you played her . talk a little bit about her game . what do you think she does really well ?
did she play the way you expected her to ?
what did michael tell you at the beginning the third set just before you came out on court ?
what do you think about playing kim tomorrow ?
about her game , you 're 3-4 in head to head meetings with her . you 've won the last three after losing the first four . what is it about her game that you 've figured out that has enabled you to be successful the last three times you played her ?
i believe pam mentioned on tv that if the results keep coming for you throughout the us open series that you 'll have a pretty good shot at getting a top 8 seeding at the us open . is that something that you 're aware of , and does that motivate you ?
right .
do you think that you 'll have a slight disadvantage tomorrow just from the late start and the fact you had to go three sets ? is there anything you can do to try to give it your best shot tomorrow ?
when you 're serving , do you hear the photographers clicking sometimes , and does it disturb ?
kim said the important thing for her tomorrow is above all to be playing good tennis at this time of the year . after losing the final at stanford , do you have a real extra motivation to go out and win a final ?
you had 62 % on first serves . started somewhat low but then really increased , especially towards the third set . are you pretty happy with that ?
that one way to cut done your unforced errors .
what did she tell you about the injury ?
talk about the pros and cons of having a day of rest before a final versus having another match under your belt .
you 've had experience retiring from matches in the '06 australian open semifinal against mauresmo . talk about when you look back and how you recover mentally from having what happened in a match .
will it help you for that you did n't have to play a long match in the heat today ?
what 's your schedule for the rest of the day ? do you go back on the practice court ?
you 've never played pavlyuchenkova , i do n't think , before .
you are 4-3 against sharapova . talk a little bit about if you play maria tomorrow . obviously you can play pavlyuchenkova , too . what challenges does her game present to you ?
from the first time you played to when you 've come back , who are the players you think have made the most improvement ?
does your daughter remember being on court with you during the us open ?
how much would a title really mean in terms of preparation for the open ? either a title or maybe even you play really well tomorrow .
you 're playing all the way until sunday here and getting as many matches as you could at this tournament . since your goal is the us open and defending your title there , at any point will you think , i have enough preparation ; i 'm gon na skip montreal ?
since you rebooted your career here last year , would it probably be a little bit more special that , okay , you 've completed your one year and you can walk away from here with the title , and then put you in the right frame of mind to return to defend your open title , or ...
do you feel like there are more injuries on tour than when you first started playing ? if so , why ?
i assume you 're gon na watch the match tonight .
what are you gon na be looking for ?
you served well for the match : 75 % of your first serves and you had some momentum going into the third set . after the weather break , it seemed things fell apart . what happened ?
can you talk about all the momentum swings in the match ? you both went on long streaks of winning many games in a row . what do you do you think causes that sort of match ?
talk about what changes you need to make in your match preparation when it 's really hot and humid in order to play a match like today . is there anything you do definitely ?
does it matter to you whether you play day or evening ? did you request that ?
you saw you played victoria azarenka a practice game . was that the first time you hit with her ?
seemed like you were getting very emotional and angry at times on the court , you know , with ball kids and stuff . do you think that ever distracts you during matches ? is that something you 're trying to work on ?
do you think it 's a problem for you more than for most players .
talk a little bit about the key differences in your game between the first and second sets before the weather delay . you came back from 5-1 , down two breaks .
have you ever been in a match with this many momentum swings ? you each won big stretches of games in a row at different times .
how do you prepare for a match like this ? you knew it was gon na be very hot and humid . is there anything different you do for a match under these conditions that maybe on indoor match , for instance , you would n't do ?
you will next play bartoli or sharapova . have you thought about that ?
after the weather delay in the third set , you won the first five games and broke her twice . did you do anything differently ? was there something you saw in her serve that enabled you to break her really quickly ?
when you 're down 5-1 in the first set , what are you thinking ? are you still thinking you could pull that set out ?
do you think that there 's a connection between a player 's off-court personality and their playing style on court ? for example if someone is laid back off court , is it hard for them to be aggressive on court ? what do you think ?
talk about your return game . it was very strong today .
with so many of the top 10 players now out of the tournament , do you give yourself a good chance to win the tournament now ?
it could be potentially be you and possibly three grand slam winners in the semifinals . does that put pressure on you , or do you just try to put it out of your mind ?
you 're on a very long win streak now . you won istanbul , and you 're in the semifinals here . is this the best tennis you 've ever played in your pro career ?
how is your energy level ? do you think you have enough energy to do two more matches in the heat ?
in the finals in istanbul you were also 4-love down against vesnina in the final set ?
and she had serve for 5-0 ?
in the third were you down , too ?
you returned very well , and yet wickmayer is known for having a rather difficult serve . was it quite easy to read today ?
when you have a run like this of win after win , is there something you feel in your game that you can put your finger on that explains the wins , or is it just the way the games come ?
wickmayer seemed to be getting very angry with herself during the match . do you notice those things when you 're playing , and how do you deal with that ?
have you always had that kind of mentality , that when you 're in a sort of 5-nil down position that you believe you can come back , you do n't get down , or is that something that you 've learned to do ?
did you notice something about her getting a little -- not dizzy , but at 5-1 in the first set she told us she really did n't feel good on her legs , shaky .
yeah .
you had n't noticed anything ?
growing up did you admire any of the russian players on tour right now still ?
what were your thoughts going into this match knowing that akgul had served 12 aces in the last match ?
were you playing with more emotion today ? it seemed like you were more animated on court . talk about that . you 've had injuries recently . how big is this result to you ?
you 're back into the top 40 now . if you make it to the final , you could be seeded for the us open . talk about how improving this much so quickly is meaningful or makes you happy .
seems like you are managing your nerves better . is it something that you 've been consciously doing , or is it just everything else working out and it 's helping that , too ?
talk about your first serve . you won almost all the points on your first serve : 22 out of the 24. that 's dominating .
are you having more fun now on the court than you did the last year or so ? has that changed at all ?
when you talk about confidence , was there a time when the results were n't going your way when your confidence went really down ? can you think of a time when it was at its worst ?
talk a little bit about your return game . that was also really strong . did you do anything different on your second returns ? because that was also really dominating : 69 % of those points you won .
as a follow up , why do you think you have more time on her returns than you thought ?
do you feel there 's a correlation between a player 's off-court personality and their playing style on court ? so for example , if someone 's laid back on court , are they less likely to be aggressive on court ?
did you change your racquet recently ?
talk about what made you change and if you like the new one .
as you 're playing more matches , how are you holding up physically ?
talk a little bit about your breakpoints . you won 4 of 6 breakpoints . that 's also dominating . did you do anything different that you did n't do before ?
considering your current form , do you almost wish you were playing montreal , or are you glad for the week off ?
you 've got a great shot to win to win the tournament . you 're in the semifinals . what do you have to do to take away this title ?
you play the winner of clijsters and pennetta . thoughts about playing either of them .
would it be better for you to play the afternoon semifinal tomorrow or the evening if the choice was up to you ?
you may play kim tomorrow . which of you do you think talks faster ?
talk a little bit about the match today . i mean , after qualifying , talk about the whole week . pretty good week for you .
looked like you struggled on your first return a lot . you only won 8 % of those points . was that a big struggle for you , something on her serve ?
were the conditions really responsible for maybe some difficulties in your return game ? obviously very humid and the ball is not gon na bounce up as high .
do you think that you were serving better yesterday , or do you think that perhaps ana was returning better today ? yesterday you had 12 aces and today you had like 2 .
you played her once before in rome . did that give you an idea of how to plan for today ?
what part of your game do you think has improved the most to help you get this quarterfinal result ?
is it fair to say with a the of the matches you had to play , six matches , no day off , you mentioned some shoulder problems . talk about that and how it might have impacted the match today ?
and no day off , unlike the open .
this is a nontennis question . on youtube or one of the web sites for the tournament there were two fans that were cheering for you and they were singing songs . have you seen the video ?
they 're apparently your biggest fans or something .
you 'll want to see the video .
you were broken four times today . is that possibly due to maybe being aggressive , overly aggressive , because you were falling behind and trying to maybe go for more shots ?
how do you avoid doing that in a match ? do you try and take more time between points ? what do you to do to counteract the feel , okay , i 'm rushing ; i need to slow down to serve better ?
you 're back into the top 80 now with this week . what is your schedule for the rest of 2010 ?
the match did n't end the way you wanted it to . can you talk about that and what you felt you were struggling with today .
did her serving surprise you a little bit ? was it more effective than she had been previously ?
where does her serving rank compared to some of the other matches played ? the stats show 12 aces and 0 double faults .
because she 's such a big powerful girl , she seems to have a variety of drop shots . because she 's so big and powerful , did it surprise you more than usual when she hit dropshots ?
with how well she played today , are you surprised she 's not in the top 100 ?
do you feel like you 're still getting over the injury in the layoff ? does that play a role ?
have you thought ahead to the us open ?
i believe six of top seven seeds have now fallen . does that speak to the competitiveness of the field , or is there anything else that links why there was an early exit for so many top-seeded players ?
congratulations on your win today . must feel good winning three matches in a row at a big tournament like this .
the scoreline is like one of the scorelines you had when you were rising to no.1 in the world back in 2008. do you think you 're playing as well as you were then ?
how would you say you 're a different player in terms of your tactics from like three months ago ?
did you think if you do get back up to the top where you were before that you 're in a better position now to stay there for a longer run ?
you were talking about your coach yesterday and how she 's helped with you your fitness . has she done anything other than just the fitness , though ? has anything else helped you ?
have you been able to do any of that stuff here this week ?
what movies did you see ?
did you like them ?
you 're score today i thought obviously was especially one-sided . do you think you played better ?
one of the nice things about watching you play when you 're winning is that you show a lot of positive emotion on the court . you do a lot of fist pumps and there were some kicks and stuff in there , too . do you plan out what you 're gon na do and the moves ? any names for the different moves you do ?
you were wearing tape under your right wristband . is that just a precautionary thing ?
in the next round you play the winner of akgul amanmuradova and jelena jankovic . can you talk about your history with jelena and where your sort of relationship with her is now ?
did the montreal situation , do you think , provide additional motivation for you here ?
talk a little bit about christina 's game . do you think she played like the 132nd player in the world ?
how do results in earlier in the day affect you , if at all , just with all the other seeds losing ?
so it did n't make you maybe focus on that part of your game a little bit more ?
she commented that you were one of the players that she admires . you probably are now playing more of those types of players who admire you or admired you growing up . can you tell us how that feels ? and part b , maybe an example of when you did that when you were coming up .
yeah .
does an easy match like this , in a sense , does did make it more difficult to play your next match ?
you only played her once before . talk about that .
you get really incredible crowd support wherever you go . this is a maybe one of the few occasions playing an american where it might be more even . why do you think it is that crowds always seem to favor you ?
is it a big help to you ?
can you remember the last time your opponent was heavily favored by the crowd ?
how much attention to you pay to the stats after a match , and which stats do you look at in particular ?
you had the opportunity to play here last year . what do you think about the new stadium renovations ?
is there much of a carryover affect - and i know you do n't look at stats that much - but tonight you were dominant on almost every single thing . service points won at 70 % ; return points won at 54 % ; only two double faults . i 'm not going to go into the whole stats . i guess does that carryover into the next match , or is it so totally separate ? it 's nice , but has nothing to do with the next match .
ana ivanovic has had some disputes recently with the montreal tournament directors about giving her a wildcard or not . when you made your comeback , twice , in '05 and '07 , you were always able to get the wildcards that you needed . any thoughts on that , and if former top players should be able to get wildcards into big events ?
as a follow-up to the question about the fans , do you have any advice for the young players who watch you ?
in the first set , she went ahead 4-3 and then you broke her to tie things up . do you feel like that was the turning point of the match ?
how do you feel about playing the winner of the sharapova/radwanska match ?
you were very aggressive today . you hit 32 winners , i think , which is an incredible number for a straight-sets win . when you 're playing against someone as defensive as caroline seems to do mostly , does it make you feel like you need to be more aggressive than usual ?
do you think that 's what her game is built around , waiting for opponent 's errors ?
do you feel like she 's hitting and serving harder ?
let 's say over the last six months . do you feel like she 's hitting harder ?
this is the sixth player that has been ranked in the top 3 that you 've defeated . can you talk about playing high-ranked players . does to bring out your best game ?
to follow up on what you were just saying about the feeling you have before you get on court , who do you think on tour you would feel like that about now ?
not only were you able to beat the top 3 player , but at one point you won eight straight games against her today . what 's going through your mind when you 're playing someone who is ranked that high , no.2 seed in the tournament , and really clobbering them ?
when you 're on a roll like that , especially in weather like this , do you have to fight the urge to kind of like try to close them out real fast so you can get off the court and conserve your energy for the next match ?
i know you 're a well-known roger federer fan . you mentioned nadal . what are your thoughts on his form lately ? some of his fans are concerned that he 's dropped a little in the rankings .
caroline was impressed about your serving performance today . did you improve both first and second serve ? did you change mechanics of your serve ?
you returned very good today . you had twelve chances to break her serve , and you took advantage of four . is it because you return well or because she did n't serve as well as in previous meetings ? how can you explain that ?
what are your expectations , or have you thought about expectations going into the us open ?
first , congratulations on your win . how did you feel going from qualifiers to beating the defending champion ?
how did you feel about playing ivanovic in the next round ?
talk about your ability to serve . there was only , what , one break in that whole set .
you had 12 aces and no double faults . can you recall ever being that effective with your serve ?
someone watching this match seeing you beating the no.2 player in the world never would guess that you 're ranked outside of top 100. you were inside the top 100 for a long time , and recently fell outside of it . what do you think has been keeping you from being ranked higher ?
speaking of points , you now made it to the quarterfinals of a premier event . it 's gon na help your ranking a lot , and will help it for a long time . you 'll probably get in now , just with these points , to the first three slams of next year probably .
tashkent ?
both of you played 19 straight games before you won three straight there . you guys were flip-flopping for 19 straight games . what were you able to do to stay cool in that situation from the heat ? and then also , what were you able to do kind of just to stay focused ?
there was only one break in today 's match . sometimes wta matches can get criticized for there being too many breaks compared to the atp . do you think that you 're sort of unique in the sense that you do n't get broken that much compared to a lot girls on tour ? do you think that your matches take on a different tone than other wta matches ?
what happened to your game after the first set ? second set was difficult , and then all the weather delays in the third . talk a little bit about that .
how much of a factor was your confidence ? you played her three times before and won all three matches . the weather comes , you 're down 5-2 in the third . how much of a factor did that play in your ability to come from behind today ?
were you a lot more aggressive in the third set ? it seemed to me like after the last rain delay you were far more aggressive at the end of the match than in the beginning .
during the delays today , did you talk with your coach about changing your strategies ?
after what happened to you with the ankle in charleston , do you get more worried about conditions on the court after a rain delay ?
at wimbledon i felt like you were sliding more than a lot of players usually do . seemed like semi-clay . did you feel that way ?
on grass ?
did you think you would have been able to win this match if not for the rain delay at 5-2 ?
what parts of your game are you really happy with today , and what parts do you really want to focus on and improve not only to go deep in this tournament , but to have a good run at the open .
when you were coming back in the third set after the second rain delay , what was really running through your mind ?
have you ever needed longer to finish a match ? it was like six hours and 15 minutes .
was it ?
the longest in one day ?
you think you play flavia pennetta next . what are your thoughts on playing her ?
you seemingly broke her serve at will today . seven breaks . what was it about her serve that made it a little bit easier for you to read tonight ?
playing someone for the first time , how did you prepare ? do you do the scouting yourself ? do you get tips from your coach ?
do you work on situational hitting in practice ? for instance , your second return game showed a big improvement from last night to tonight .
how would you rate your defense tonight ?
you talked last night about control of the ball and control of your strokes . do you feel like you improved on that tonight ?
seemed like your second serve was a little bit off today in terms of at least the points you won . you only 16 % of your second-serve points ?
was that you being so aggressive or maybe her being to aggressive on your second one ?
how much can you tell about an opponent just from hitting with them in the warm-up ?
were you happy with the way you served in general ? you were only broken three times tonight , but last night was two in two sets .
and then it looked like you had some trouble converting some breakpoint opportunities . you were only 7 of 18 tonight . why do you think you missed so many chances to break ?
when you 're playing a point , do you like longer rallies , or do you want to kind of quick and just to put it away ?
this is n't about your game tonight , but earlier this year i think you came out with maria sharapova clothing line with cole haan . do you get to design your own outfits when you play , and did you design your outfit for this year 's us open ?
the only question i was told to ask you is nontennis about your handbag . where did you get it ?
do you prefer day or night matches , or does it not matter ?
any preference ?
congratulations on your second win in a row . how are you feeling with your game right now ? you must be feeling pretty good .
do you think the weather really impacted the match , where the first set was really easy for you and the second set was a lot closer ?
seems like you included the variety you were practicing , even towards the end of the match when players can perhaps get a little tight .
you have a new coach that 's been with you , a woman , serbian . can tell us about her , what her name is and what you two have been doing together ?
from a technical standpoint , what did you do differently in this match ? you only played her once before and you lost to her .
i was wondering what you did differently .
it seems like your pace of has quickened . do you think so ? is that something you 've done consciously ?
you made some news by declining a wildcard you were given to montreal . can you talk about the whole process , what 's going on with that tournament , and how everything worked out ? because i know initially you were n't and then you were .
will you ever play montreal again ? do you think you 're gon na stop playing there ?
that 's what i wanted to ask you . you received a lot of the support actually from your fans for taking a stand . but for the fans that were in montreal and were looking forward to seeing you , what would you say to them ?
i think in stanford you were thinking of going , and then now you 're not . so what changed ? was it the tournament director 's comments perhaps ?
do you feel pretty welcome here ? this is your second appearance here .
you 've been recently talking to dinara safina , i saw , at the san diego players ' party or something . you 've had sort of similar struggles lately . can you talk about sort of your relationship with her ?
so you talk about nontennis stuff ?
what did you think about during today 's delay , and was it beneficial ?
will you still play doubles andrea petkovic , who , like you , has her fans , too , if not in montreal , somewhere else ?
with such a long delay , two delays , did you get something to eat in the interim ? how did you go about that process of deciding should you eat , should you not eat ?
i 'll just go back to montreal one more time . was it an emotional decision for you ?
during the delay , did you reflect on your game ?
this match went really similar to your match against her in ponte vedra beach . what was the game plan coming in ?
she was only able to hit one winner today in the whole match . what were you able to do to make that possible ?
were you happy with your first-serve percentage ? seemed a little low : 42 % .
what do you need to do to improve that ?
do you think you might want to slow it down a little bit ?
so fast points to get out of there ?
do you remember the last time you played when it was this hot ?
you played very well in istanbul . you made the final and lost a tough final there . how much momentum do you think you can bring from that run into cincinnati ? you play schiavone in the next round , and she 's been having some trouble since the french open . is that a match you think you can win ?
you have n't played schiavone in four years . such a long interval between matches , does that pose some unique challenges versus somebody you 're more familiar with that you 've played with recently ?
you 're victory against the williams sisters at wimbledon , where does that rank for you in your career ?
what do you think is the secret to beating the williams sisters ?
aside from improving your serve , what other aspects of your game do you really want to improve prior to the us open specifically ?
you lost all seven your breakpoints on your serve . what technically went wrong today ?
how much was the heat an issue for you out there ?
when you were down 0-3 in the first , you called your coach to the court . what did he tell you ?
as much as you try keep points long , do you get think you ever get sucked into being too defensive ? i saw in the stats you only had one winner .
did you feel any extra pressure this year because of how well you did at the open last year ? i looked up the record this year , and first- and second-round exits on the precious eight tournaments , and i 'm just kind of wondering what part of that is you 're young versus maybe feeling a little bit of extra pressure to do well .
is there anything you can do maybe to block out of a lot those distractions ? i mean , some of that comes with experience .
christina mchale is another young american . she won today earlier , the match before yours . would having another american up-and-comer help you in terms of taking away some of the spotlight from you ?
what specific things in vesnina 's game bothered you . the results were similar to your match in ponte vedra beach .
from a positive standpoint , was there anything that you did today that you liked and that you may want to improve on ?
last night ivanovic mentioned that because she was unseeded she tended to get more difficult draws . do you think that 's maybe affecting you as well ?
do you think it would help you to maybe scale back and play smaller tournaments after the us open , like quebec city or something like that to get the wins under your belt ?
us open is less than a month away now .
with how much hype there was last year , what were you expecting the hype and tension to be like in 2010 ?
what 's been the biggest adjustment for you from last year to this year ? obviously you 're playing higher-quality players . but , i mean , travel , you know , what has been maybe two or three of the biggest changes or adjustments you 've had to make that 's been tough ?
media stuff ?
i saw john isner in washington last week , and he 's already talking about how he 's really sick of talking about the wimbledon match . can you relate ? do you have similar fatigue talking about your us open run ?
you seemed overwhelmed by emotion understandably at the end . can you put into perspective what it all meant to you ?
how difficult was it to deal with your frustrations during the match with the unforced errors ?
you said before the match that you had to stop her from dominating . how do you do that , and why is she so dominant ?
do you think she 's beatable ?
after being involved in the final today , how do you use that as motivation to go one step further in future slams ?
can you describe her serve for us , what it 's like facing her serve , what kind of spin she 's using , those sorts of things .
there are very few players who play both singles and doubles . you 're in both finals . to what extent has your singles game improved by having played doubles ?
what was the whole experience of being in the final like ? what was the morning like , the buildup , and how were you ?
most people would be really intimidated being in their first final . you did n't look intimidated at all .
did you have to be persuaded to parade around with your trophy at the end ? you did n't seem quite to know what to do .
if you had to characterize this tremendous two-week run of yours , how in a word or two would you characterize ?
does your drive for perfection help you in your career or is it sometimes a problem ? did you have any health issues before going into the final ?
of all the weapons that you 've seen other players have , how would you describe serena williams ' first serve as a weapon ?
where does this win rate for you in comparison to the others that you 've won ?
can you describe what goes through your mind when you 're dominating a match the way you did today and the way you did for most of this tournament .
why do you think you have been so able to dominate during this tournament ?
it was pretty clear from the start that she was going to try to meet your power with power . did that occur to you , and did it comfort you thinking , i got her on my turf ?
do you still get nervous in these occasions ?
you talk about you did n't play your best , but 94 % first serve is pretty outstanding .
no .
you made 94 points when you put the first serve in .
she said it was a really big factor today in this match for her .
you said your father taught you to serve . could you imagine then you would be the greatest female server in the history of the game ?
you 've overtaken billie . how many grand slam titles do you think you win and how many will you be happy to win over the course of your career ?
do you know how much you can bench press ?
in other sports they dream about hitting the game-winning shot . you do n't dream of winning in a blow-out . is there part of you that wishes you were tested to do what it was like to be out there 4-all in the third ?
how important to you is your place in the history of the game and where you 're considered among the all-time greats ?
about four years ago you were criticized for a certain kind of indifference , being more interested in pet projects and acting than in tennis . do you think in the big picture you 've turned that around ? do you think you 've gotten the most out of your career and talents ?
you talk about passing billie jean . looking at the names ahead of you , do you ever take a look at that and say , wow ?
is tennis your way of drawing attention to your wider interests , as you just mentioned ?
what will be your thoughts when we get to the us open after the way things ended last year and you have this summer in front of you to get ready for it ?
your dad just said that it actually was good for you , all that hullabaloo happened , that it taught you some lessons . could you reflect on that ? do you think you learned from that experience ?
we saw you go out and take the dish out to the fans and sign autographs in the walkway . when you came back in the clubhouse , you were dancing around with joy . can you express what you were feeling at that moment ?
have you thought about any timetable or plan for your career ? did you still think you would be playing at 28 ?
is there a chance you 'll still be playing at 38 , do you think ?
yeah .

can you see yourself in 10 years ' time after pete has pulled you off the court sitting out there with him looking down on the champions of that age ?
how about not losing a set in this whole tournament ...
four wimbledon titles and 13 grand slams must give you a bit of clout . is there anything positive you 'd like to change about this championship or about the game of tennis in general ?
how much more difficult is it for you when venus is on the other side of the net in a wimbledon final ?
how much easier is it when venus is n't around for the final to face you ?

looked like you held up some fingers shortly after the match , pointing towards your family . what was that ?
excluding your talented sister , what have been the toughest strokes that you have faced in terms of the serve , return , groundstrokes ?

why is that ?
where do you want lebron to end up ?
you 're one of wimbledon 's great champions . was there a champion from the past you would have loved to play on that centre court ?
the hawk-eye is such a big part of tennis now . there 's a big argument in football about whether or not it should be brought in because of the goals and all that . do you have anything to say to the decision makers in that sport about whether or not it works and whether or not they should do it ?
you say they probably should bring it in ?
speaking about hawk-eye , in the third game of the second set you hit a wide slice serve ; she challenged ; it was overturned ; you get a second serve ; you hit the exact same serve . was that going to be like , let me show you again ?
speaking of hawk-eye , you could argue because of the mess in new york with jennifer that night , the same umpire in the chair today .
in some way do you take in some pride that not only the usta apologized to you , but it really did lead to hawk-eye and your getting messed over that night led to a huge change in our game ?
what does this mean to you and what does it feel like ?
if it is serena williams as your opponent , how would you describe the challenge before you ?
you 've been a very good player for a long time . you 've been working towards this moment for a long time . what in particular in these last two weeks has worked so well for you ?
have you worked with a professional on the mental side of your game ? is that just poise and maturity , or have you worked with a sports psychologist or performance coach ?
do you think the injuries might have been almost like a disguised blessing , that it gave you time to reassess ?
can you describe how you felt emotionally today versus how you felt when you played dinara in australia in the semifinals and did n't play your best .
you spoke earlier about how tough a challenge serena williams would be . can you get more specific about what the key to you possibly having success would be against her ?
how much of an advantage does her serve give her against anybody ?
is there anything in your background , in your experience with her , that might give you particular confidence going in against her ?
you 've had three coaches now in the last eight months . can you talk about that . was it difficult for you ? can you talk about your new relationship with sergei , who has just come on the scene .

i saw you on the bbc talking about robin van persie , the dutch football player . did you meet him in amsterdam somewhere during rehab ?
are you still in touch with him somehow ?
are you going to watch the game tomorrow ?
he 'll be playing tomorrow .
studying economics , how much of tennis is a business and a job for you and how much of it is just love for the sport ?
at this point serena williams is considered maybe the biggest favorite to win the title in the last 10 years , maybe in history . when you think of the possibility of an upset , you against her , what goes through your mind ?
were you worried at all ?
the match , how it was going early .
a little bit ?
when you got down a break , what are you thinking ? i got to break back as fast as i can or just let the match go as it goes ?
how do you describe the difference between the two sets ?
you had your shoulder taped yesterday in doubles . was that just preventive or was there a problem ?
you had 80 aces for the tournament . venus is second at 30. that 's a pretty huge gap . can you talk about that number of aces .

your third career ?
what 's the biggest danger for you going into the final ?
how would you describe her game ? what does she do best ?
after you and venus lost the doubles yesterday , you did n't come to a press conference . today a fine was announced . can you describe your explanation for not doing a press conference and your reaction to the fine .
how would you prepare for the final , because it 's going to be different ? how do you normally prepare if you 're playing your sister ? it 's going to be different playing someone else . will there be changes in your preparation ?
you said that vera does n't do anything terrible . is there anything in tennis that you do terrible ? is there anything in life that you do terrible ?
do you tend to sleep well before a final like this ? do you just ease into it or do you really feel it churning inside ?
were you unaware that members of the press had requested the press conference ? do you expect to appeal the fine ?
would you want to appeal ?
$ 4,000 each .
how old were you when you first learned that there 's such a place as centre court wimbledon ?
do you feel more comfortable playing on centre court or arthur ashe ?
wimbledon or the us open ?
the feelings that you have , let 's say day of leading into the match , do you think they 'll be any different this year because you 're so heavily favored ?

what did you learn about yourself these last two weeks ? must be a lot of confidence inside .
do you like grass a little more now than you used to ?
are you going to watch tomorrow tomas ' semifinal ?
but i suppose you are rooting for tomas .
do you think he can do what you can not do today : win ? do you think he can win tomorrow ?
do you take anything else out of this match today from a standpoint of knowing that you 've gotten this far and maybe down the road you can do better , and as good as serena played , especially in the second set ?
this gives you a lot of opportunities on the wta tour . you 're playing in copenhagen in one month . you 'll be one of the seeded players . what do you think about the chances this gives you in the next couple of months , especially in copenhagen ?
you fought really well in the first set . at what point of the game did you feel you could actually win the match ? did you feel like that ?

looking at your balance and your movements , the way you do splits quite elegantly , is this something you trained for particularly ? do you have a past as a gymnast or a dancer ?
mentally you seemed to manage the match very well . can you talk about what you were feeling inside ?
why were you able to do that today when maybe earlier in your career you might not have ?
what do you know about your semifinal opponent ? must be rather a surprise that you 're not playing venus , that you 're playing pironkova .
what were her strengths when you played her in moscow ?
you had some really strong results a while back in your career , then there were some tough results and your injury . what was it like when you were really struggling , trying to get over your injury ? did you imagine relatively quickly you 'd reach the wimbledon semifinal ?
this was your first victory against kim clijsters today . what made the difference today ?
you are a promoter of gender equality . what have you achieved , and what are your goals with that job ?
you spoke about concentration . you always had your towel over your head . is that one part of your concentration ? for instance , did you see what the score was between pironkova and venus ?
so you did n't know about venus ?
pironkova is one of the younger players left here . why do you think we 're not seeing more teenagers breaking through at these big tournaments ?
you said on your way off court you hoped it would be mentioned on the news back home . how will this be taken back there ?
did you expect yourself to play a semifinal at wimbledon ?

how many grass courts do you have in bulgaria ?
you have no grass courts ?
so when was the first occasion in your career you started playing on grass ?
did you feel that venus was losing her way a bit as the match went on ? towards the end she was making more errors .
she grabbed her back early in the match . the pace of her serve seemed to fall off a little after that . how much did you notice that ?
was her serve what you expected as far as the speed ?
of course the wonderful maleeva sisters are from your country . could you talk about tennis in bulgaria and also how you got started in tennis .
are you from sophia ? how did you get started ?
do they have academies for kids in your country ? how do they develop players there ?
does the country 's federation start paying your travel expenses when you 're 14 , 15 , 16 years old ?
what memories do you have of wimbledon growing up ?
why do you say that ?
so when you think of yourself out there in the women 's semifinals on thursday , what is your reaction ?
do you think you have more to offer in the semifinal ?
why do you think there 's an aging trend in women 's tennis ?
you 're one of the younger quarterfinalists . why do you think we 're seeing older players that seem to be doing better than younger players ?
even people who do n't follow tennis have heard of venus williams . in the nicest possible way , not many people have heard of you . are you ready for all the attention that is going to bring ?
some people ca n't clearly cope with it . you seem confident . is that part of the reason why you 've been successful at it ?
what else helps you ? is there anything in your family or personal life that keeps you going ?
you said wimbledon was like a religion . the gods of wimbledon have not been kind to you for many years .
now they 're very nice . why do you think the change ?
you said to the bbc you had a particularly poor 2009 ; that you hardly won a game . was there a reason for that ? if not , did you ever think about quitting the game altogether ?
can you talk about zvonareva , your semifinalist opponent ? have you played against her very often ?
the williams sisters have had an air of invincibility around this place for many years . do you think this result can help in that image ?
the williams sisters , they 've been so dominant in this competition for years . do you think that dominance might be starting to end now ?
do you see signs their strengths are decreasing ?
were there things you learned in that match against venus that you used today ?
seemed to be a strong first set you had , but seemed to fade away a bit in the second . could n't keep up the intensity ?
you always have very good games against her , although it 's 5-1 her favor . you do n't seem to be intimidated by her on the court ; is that right ?
a lot of players are intimidated by serena williams . you do n't seem to be . you go out and seem to like to play her aggressive game against her .
how do you assess your overall wimbledon this time around ?
how did you feel when you had those matchpoints against you ? did you ever stop believing , or did you always think you 'll get through the next point and carry on ?
you 've never won a tour match on grass before this tournament . now you 're in the semifinals . did you practice much on grass before coming here , or did you just think , grass , it 's only a couple of weeks , we 'll get on hard courts and my season can continue ?
was there a point during the match where you thought she was just playing too well , she was going to win , you had no chance ?
can you talk about the tiebreaker . she had three match points . you fought them off . then you get into the third set where maybe you should have momentum , and all of a sudden it 's 4-0 for her . can you talk about what you were thinking then ?
when did you realize you had a great chance to win ? was it at the game where she served for the match and maybe got nervous ?
you had such a comfortable win in the previous round against a much higher-ranked opponent . did that drain you emotionally for the start of this game ?
you were struggling on your service a lot .
when you beat azarenka 6-0 in the second set , she said , i think petra , that girl , played the best tennis of her life . do you feel like you can play that kind of level all the time ?
the future is against serena , who has won 12 grand slam titles . she has a lot of experience . she 's very good on grass . how do you go into that match and play your best and not get so nervous playing on the big court against her ?
do you think you can win the tournament here ? do you think you can be wimbledon champion ?
why not ?
had you sought any advice from the last left-handed czech to win at wimbledon , martina ?
has she spoken to you throughout your career ?
has she given you advice over the last few years ?
did you meet her today or yesterday ?
so she said , you have to serve and volley all the time ?
has jana novotna given you advice recently or over the years ?
is martina navratilova a big hero for you ?
you must be quite frustrated to have had a few opportunities to reach that . what was going through your mind on match points ?
do you feel it was your opponent who won the points rather than you not being able to close it out ?
what did you think when she hit her second serve and it hit the net on match point ?
from your side of things , what happened with the 4-love lead in the third set ?
were you surprised after the ease with which she 'd beaten the no.3 seed how beatable she looked today ? she served particularly badly .
do you still remain positive about the tournament you 've had ? is it just disappointment ?
what caused your ranking to slip down so far ? was it an injury ?
i think you 'll be back into the top 50. do you think you can use this to push on back towards the top 30 again ?
sometimes the players walk off separately . you waited for her today . why did you do that ? just 'cause it 's wimbledon ?
walk out after the match together ?
do you think it came down to maybe handling the occasion better , or do you think you handled the occasion on court well ?
at 4-love , 5-3 , did you have thoughts of playing in the semifinal ?
has there been much reaction back at home that you 're aware of ?
are there a lot of good junior tennis players in estonia ? how does the federation develop players ? do they put players in academies ?
were you at some point , when you were 16 years old ?
how did you develop ? on your own ? through an academy ?
why not ?
are you still without a coach at the moment ?
do you think he had a big role in your run here ?
you 'll stay together , perhaps , with your new coach ?
were you feeling tired today ? you 've played a lot of matches , eight matches overall . was that part of the third set ?
you felt okay ?
why have you not named this coach officially your coach ?
have you seen him since the end of the match ? if so , what did he say to you ?
are you as stunned as we are ?
she obviously played well down the stretch . did you feel like you were running out of gas ? did n't recover well from yesterday ?
you talked about the adjustments you made against henin . were they not there today ?
you 've had some great success since your comeback . you 've been also somewhat unpredictable . do you think it has something to do with you took a break , your life is enriched , it 's not as important to focus ?
in a bigger picture , wozniacki , the last teenager , went out yesterday . a lot of names who really are n't that familiar are going really deep into this tournament . could you talk about that .
do we expect too much of you after the us open ?
is any of this a function of match readiness ? would you think about playing more tournaments as the season goes on ?
what are the biggest things you think you need to work on between now and the open ?
when you return home , do you go to sort of a domestic mindset and work around the house ? could you talk about what your life is like when you 're not in the midst of a huge tournament back at home .
how competitive will the best of belgium match be ? it 's an exhibition . exhibitions very often are played for fun , so everybody has a good time . it implies there 's kind of a serious confrontation .
do you go out playing as if it 's a fourth round of wimbledon ?
do you feel like this is the best grass court tennis you 're playing this year ?
do you feel like you 're playing well enough to go another round deeper to make your first semifinal here ?
is there an element of your game that you 've been particularly pleased with over the last week ?
how soon during the match did you realize that jelena was having problems ?
do you know what was wrong with her ? what did she tell you when she shook hands with you at the end ?
both your potential opponents are still on court at the moment . do you feel like your game works better against one than the other ?
what do you think you have to do well , whoever it is , what will you be concentrating on that day ?
on a scale of 1 to 10 , how will you rate your game today ?
so what happened after the first set ? what was going through your mind in the second set ?
can you talk about facing her serve . she 's so tough to break .
that 's a lot of pressure on your service games .
you seem to respond well to playing matches on those terms . is that accurate ?
you both hitting big balls , points are over in two or three strokes . that seems well within your comfort zone .
how would you rate the way you played today both mentally and physically ?
did you feel the crowd were on your side today ?
would you like to come back ?
is she the ultimate test , especially on grass here ?
were the conditions out there even more consistent to big serving ?
tennis players are sometimes dismissed as being self-centered . you and friends and family members are going to be going to chernobyl . the disaster there occurred 24 years ago . are the problems still ongoing ?
also in our country we 're having a major disaster . can you in any way relate the two disasters ?
there still are serious problems there .
the last three tournaments you played very close to very good players in all matches . do you feel like you 're close to getting over the line ? what 's it going to take for you to tip the scales in your favor ?
how much of getting back to the position you were in and would like to be in again is now at this point a mental issue as opposed to a physical issue ?
after playing that well this afternoon , do you feel you can come back and win wimbledon again ?
as a stylish tennis player , you look stylish on and off court . can you give us some information about your necklace ?
do you wear it every time you play ?
is it a lucky pendant ?
if serena continues to serve at this level , do you think anyone can beat her here ?
it looked quite simple out there for you . did it feel comfortable and simple ?
how is your form compared to the last time you got to the quarterfinals four years ago ?
are you able to sit down and watch the sharapova/williams match , or you 're happy to go with the flow ?
will you watch it at the hotel ?
you 've done very well on grass this year so far . why is that ? what is it about your game that helps you on this surface ?
what have you done well this week and last week and in birmingham , do you think ?
is it very different ? do you find wimbledon very different ? is the grass different ?
and is wimbledon very different from birmingham ? do you find it different ?
do you feel the expectations growing further as you go further into this tournament ?
do you feel like you 're well enough to keep going ?
given that you beat maria recently , would you prefer to play her next ? you have a pretty good record against serena , as well , recently and in australia .
great match today . can i just ask , why are you such a dangerous opponent on grass ?
are there any particular shots that you were pleased with today ? was anything working well in particular ?
everything ?
what are your thoughts on your next match against kanepi ?
we do n't know you very well . can you tell us a little bit who you are .
there is a challenger in prostejov ?
there is an academy , too ?
the national tennis center ?
so you practice with lucie safarova and berdych ?
the name of your coach is in the media guide , or you have a new one ?
did you expect to be so good at this tournament ? did you improve your practice specially for this tournament ?
what are your weaknesses and strengths ?
what does wimbledon mean to you ? this is your best grand slam so far . how special is it ?
are you close to safarova ? you are good friends ?
what was the injury ?
in the elbow ?
how much did it bother you after it happened ?
was there a particular shot that it bothered you on the most ?
did you hurt it jamming it into the ground or ...
overextended ?
you seemed to be so much in control until early in the second set . how do you think the match changed ?
wimbledon has the right to change seedings as opposed to rankings . do n't you think they should have had you and kim on the opposite sides of the draw ?
i know you said last week you did n't feel that you were a contender to win wimbledon this year . do you feel if you come back next year that you hope to be in a position where you can ?
for most all your career , you 've had to go up against players who are bigger . is there something in that challenge for you that is appealing , but on the other hand is there a part of you that wishes you might be a little bit bigger ?
there was one phase of your career when you really focused on your conditioning . is that something you might consider now , just really focusing on that aspect ?
like everyone else , you 're dealing with a limited number of chances to win this tournament . do you think it will get more difficult or not necessarily ?
do you remember the very first time you played her ? she could n't remember it . she said you were little girls .
national championship ? under eights or under nines ?
you must be disappointed today . but your last month has been very satisfying .
did you tighten up or did she loosen up towards the end of the second set ?
before the game , what did you think you needed to do to be able to beat her ?
how close do you think you came to beating her today ?
how much do you think your game has come along this year to make last 16 on clay and grass ?
what do you think of her level of play ?
what do you need to do to your game to take it to the next level of these other players ?
what did you think when things were delayed at the beginning ? did you know whether anything was going on ?
what did you think when the fans booed her ?
you can be very hard on yourself sometimes when you do make mistakes . does that motivate you or does that distract you , do you think ?
what are your plans for the next few months ?
can you talk about turning that match around ?
how have you managed to push this rivalry in your favor ?
where were you in the first set ?
it looked like you , but did n't play like you .
we 're accustomed to having fireworks and drama when you two have met . what was different , if anything , today for you mentally as you got into the third set ?
there 's been a lot said about justine and wimbledon . sentimentally people think she has the kind of game and maybe she should win here . it is n't as if your game is terrible here either on grass . can you talk about what the tournament means to you , the grass court game , how it favors you in some ways ?
what was the first time you played justine when you were very young ? what role do you think your size , your athleticism , plays in the matchup against justine ?
who won that first match ?
were you about 10 years old ?
do you think the hot , dry conditions might be benefitting players that are a little more comfortable on a hard court , less sure of their footing on grass this fortnight ?
the footing on the grass .
yeah .
was this a triumph for motherhood ?
she was going for your forehand a lot , really trying to work it , find a groove . is there a point at which somebody going to that one shot , you knowing it all the time , becomes an advantage to you ?
what does it feel like to be in that type of serving groove ?
i know you had a talk with your serve the other day , you said . you must be pleased with the response ?
maybe you spent too much time working on your curtsy instead of your serve ?
you whizzed through the first set 6-love . then what happened ? did she pick her game up or you slipped a little bit ?
you 've won every single first set here 6-love . how do you explain that ?
what do you put it down to ? better preparation , perhaps ?
are those two things linked in a way ? i 've won 6-love , i 'm flying , is that where you lose focus and that is why she gets a chance to come back ?
what is the atmosphere like in the locker room and on the grounds on the monday when everybody is playing , when there 's so many big matches ? is it a great day for players as much as fans ?
you may have maria on monday . does it seem early for that matchup ? that could be a final .
are you looking for a big challenge at this stage of the tournament so you pick your game up ?
which of the players here impressed you the most so far ?
that you might be meeting later on , which has been most impressive ?
what are your memories of the 2004 final ? it was sort of a shock to the world at that point .
did you really even know who she was at that point ? she was not a famous player back then .
in all the matches you played , do you remember losing a first set yourself 6-love ?
how do you compare your form at the end of the first week to last year when you won ?
what are you unhappy about ? at the end you shrugged like you were n't thrilled with today 's performance .
getting back to the 6-love thing , for players that do lose 6-love , 6-love , 6-1 , do you think it 's humiliating to get beaten so soundly ?
how intense is it when you play maria ?
do you want to talk a little bit more about that , versus some other players ? you 're both grand slam champions , both hit hard , return well , serve big .
we had an incident last night where a player lost his cool with the crowd . generally speaking , for a player , how hard is it to keep cool if the match is going badly and the crowd is on your back ?
is it good for the tour that maria has come back , that she seems to be regaining her form after the shoulder surgery and her struggles last year ?
how hard is it to come back from an injury ? you 've done it . when you 're a champion , do you think , what 's the point ? how hard is it to do the work and come back ?
you have n't played maria in a couple years , have n't played her on grass since 2004. do you have to feel each other out in the beginning of a match or do you know what you 're going to get ?
what is the key to the match , getting ahead in the points , dictating ?
you briefly referred to losing your cool . what has been the follow-up on that foundation or the fundraising , $ 92,000 , whatever it was ? when you look back , do you have any regrets ?
what concert do you regret ?
speaking of music , rapper and pop star sean kingston , he 's just 20. he called you absolutely stunning and said he wants an older woman and you 're that woman . are you a fan of sean kingston ? maybe that 's the concert you 'll be going to next .
do you like a toy boy , a younger man ?
do you plan on cheering on america in the world cup tonight ?
7:30 .
you will be watching ?
why do you seem to be so critical of your own form at the majors early on ? you 're almost never satisfied with your matches .
do you feel if you 're not critical of yourself early on , you wo n't peak when you need to later on ?
how is the writing going ?
maria sharapova was very hard-hitting when she came up . is she still among the three best hard-hitting women or which are those ?
back to the incident at the us open , do you think there 's any chance that the same thing could happen to you here , that you might have had a better chance of keeping your cool given the atmosphere of the tournament ?
strawberries and cream outfit , serena ?
where did that come from ?
was that a really useful workout or harder than you would have liked ?
do you think facing serena williams has come too early for you in the draw ?
obviously we remember you playing here most of all , you probably remember most of all , beating her in 2004. can you tell us a bit about how you think back to that ?
you must still have some happy memories of it .
how different are you as a person and as a player now to the 17-year-old girl then ?
do you have to do anything different against her or is it all going to be on execution ?
some of your matches , getting a quick start seems to have played a big factor . i remember wimbledon 2004 , you came out smoking . is that going to be a factor , do you think ?
what is your most memorable match against her ?
she still hits the ball as hard as she did then . you obviously must feel that you hit it a lot harder now that you can match her for that pace and power .
you 've been coming in to net not a lot , but certainly more than 2004. do you feel you 're comfortable up there ? is it like 50 % comfortable ?
how much of the match is going to be a mental battle rather than a physical battle with serena ?
this could go deep into the third set . if it does , does that favor either one of you ?
since you came back from your shoulder injury , do you feel you 're now all the way back ? do you think you are now the player that you were , or is there still some way to go before you reach the peak you were at ?
could you talk about a big rivalry match like this and how it compares to a standard or regular match ? when you know you 're going up against a big rival , do you like it ? do you find yourself more engaged ? does it change your preparation in any way ?
i know you reached the semis of roland garros last year . but is this the best you 've felt form-wise at a slam ?
quarters , sorry .
i know you reached quarters there . but is this the best you felt at a slam form-wise since the shoulder surgery ?
what is the main difference between playing serena versus venus ?
about your match , it seemed like it was a pretty easy win . how would you sort of characterize your match today ?
you made it look easy .
let me ask you just a couple quick questions about sort of the state of polish tennis . it seems at the moment that polish tennis is quite strong . you 're seeing more people that are in this year this have gone through further . how would you characterize what 's happening in polish tennis ? and do you feel a bit of pressure because you 're the last person in terms of singles from poland that 's still in the championship ?
and last question : tell me first of all in terms of why do you think polish tennis is becoming stronger ? is there more money ? better facilities ? more sort of interest in it ? and also , would you say that there 's sort of more support ? no ? everybody is sort of shaking their head .
this is family business .
just talk about your level . you have to be happy with that .
what do you think you did overall that was so good today ?
are you healthy enough now and motivated enough and strong enough to get back to the level where you were before you had the injury ?
how long have you felt that way ? because your results since the spring have not been that great . roland garros was not as good as you can play , and eastbourne .
you probably heard this from some of your compatriots , but two years ago there were six russian women in the top 10 ; now there 's only one , elena . is it because of age or injuries ? why do you think that 's happening ?
there was also a time when you would have three players and you would have a couple more come up and replace them . you 'd have someone that was 21 , 22 , 23. now you have kleybanova , pavlyuchenkova maybe coming up to the level of top 20 , top 10. do you see them as being real elite players , or do we still have to wait and see on them ?
would you say that game today was a tad bit tough ?
you get down a break early . does that faze you at all or do you figure , i 'll get it back ?
when you come back here year after year , having won it 10 years ago , do you start thinking , i 'm getting older , or when you return is it just the same as every year ?
what do you know about jarmila groth ?
justine and kim both won their matches today , so they 'll face each other next . what are your thoughts about the similarities and differences between them and that matchup ?
can you describe the differences and what you think makes their matchup so compelling ?
do you sometimes slap yourself and say , i 'm still here , i 'm no.2 , my sister is no.1 ?
if you were a fan , which ticket would you like to have , the monday here at wimbledon or the saturday at the us open ?
monday at wimbledon ?
why ?
the whole fourth round is that day . is it the variety of the matches ? you like the tradition of the tournament ? as a fan , why do you choose that ticket ?
obviously there 's so much conversation and interest in the isner-mahut match . what was it like in the locker rooms ? did you and the people you were talking to and your sister follow it and discuss it ?
what do you have to do to dial in at this stage ? get serious , going gets tough ?
do you feel much pressure at this point in the tournament ?
does anyone out there worry you ?
the injury , it 's above the knee ?
obviously you were world no.1 , and then you went on some sort of fitness program in order to try and get stronger , did you , and that did n't quite have the results that you wanted ?
but because you 're now playing well , do you regret sort of experimenting with that side ?
it seems like you 're very happy on court with the way that you 're playing .
i saw your match and i saw kim 's match . you both look in terrific form . you both look as if you 're capable of going a long way in this tournament , maybe right to the end of the tournament . do you feel it 's a shame that one of you must depart on monday evening ?
how would you describe your style of play and kim 's , the similarities and differences ?
how has your relationship evolved ?
you played three matches here . you 've had a couple of matches in the netherlands last week . how do you compare your grass court game in 2006 and 2007 ?
is it a little bit easier coming here , more relaxing , than when you were world no.1 coming here ?
did the nature of your return change at all after the australian open when you saw you could still do this well ?
you talk about having rediscovered the sense of self during the time away . have you maintained that during the six months you 've been back ?
can you tell me which elements of your life are fun and which are serious and which one tennis falls into ?
when you and kim came up many years ago , it created a great buzz in belgium . did the interest in tennis dip after you retired , and how is it now ?
you must be fairly pleased with that because you made a tricky match look fairly comfortable ?
quick break back in the second set .
how do you feel now about the prospect of facing justine ?
if you were to describe your style of play and justine 's for somebody who had never seen either of you play , how would you describe them ?
what are your thoughts that the matchups in your career has been even ?
can it actually be fun at a major or is it just too intense ?
justine said she needs a year to feel she 's fully back . you 've had a lot of great results , but a couple not so great results . do you attribute some of that inconsistent stuff to time or something else ?
after the us open , did the type of work change ? did it become less fun leading up to the us open , not sure what you can do ? now you know what you can do , it becomes more of a work thing again ?
you played justine 24 times . is it still something special , emotional to play her ?
is your relationship different than before your comebacks of you both or is it the same ?
one of the great things about our sport is that we basically play on three different surfaces . could you take a moment and talk about of the three surfaces which requires the most athleticism ? how can you compare the three in terms of what it requires athletically ?
how do you think you played today ?
any parts of your game that you particularly want to work ongoing forward ?
and you 've done well here before . what do you need as a player to do well at wimbledon ?
my last question : can you make the final ?
that 's why i 'm asking .
there is some strapping on your hand . what is that ?
the the next round looks like an unseeded opponent , and after that possibly could be venus . how do you feel about that ?
was that a performance fit for a queen , caroline ?
were you in any way disappointed that the queen did n't stop for your game ?
did she have any words of encouragement for you ?
what did it feel like you were in a line with the greats of tennis ?
when did you find out you were going to be in that line ?
did you have lunch with her ?
after what happened with isner and mahut today , do you worry one of your matches could go to 70-68 in the final set ?
it 's great for tennis .
your bow had a lot of rhythm to it , tremendous depth . some critics thought it might be a tad overproduced . can you analyze it ?
so you 're blaming your injuries ?
what was it like meeting the queen ?
yesterday venus told me your curtsy was unreal . she also said you 'd beat her in a curtsy-off . do you think there was too much hype for your curtsy ?
how did you find playing on court 2 ?
are you of two minds ? because you 're the champion , you feel you should be on centre ?
i notice yesterday you were watching the usa game , were n't you ?
you were tweeting , were n't you ?
but some of these tweets were then sort of taken away later . why was that ?
what are your thoughts on the isner match and its effect on your sport ?
how would you describe what you know of the match and of the person who won it ?
there have been arguments about playing a tiebreak in the fifth set at wimbledon , or the third set in your case . what are your thoughts on that matter ?
how did you feel when you saw your court assignment today ?
i 'm doing an interview with sasha , your hitting partner , tomorrow . some players change hitting partners from tournament to tournament . why do you like to work with him on a regular basis ?
how do you feel your game is compared to this stage last year here ?
in what way ?
the queen is famous for her gift of brief small talk . what was your exchange ?
andy roddick tweeted she said to him , i love your work on all the american pie films . people thought it was n't a joke . it shows that people do n't get a lot of the tweets .
what did you call the queen ? did you say , hey , girl ?
she had the blue outfit , great matching old-school hat . what did you think of the outfit ?
she does blue well ?
how do you think this day will be remembered in tennis history with the visit by the queen and the isner match ?
were you more nervous for prince william or the queen ?
what is it about her ? just the tradition ? is she different from all the celebrity red-carpet events ?
on your level , are you maybe being too hard on yourself that you beat a former top 5 player fairly quickly ?
you seemed quite aggressive from the start today . was that part of the game plan ?
i know it is n't exactly the women 's case , but how do you feel about those guys playing more than 200 games maybe ? you think it should be decided by a tiebreaker ?
if you ended up playing to 20-all ...
if you had a different shoulder and the match went on that long , would you want a tiebreaker or do you think you 're just going to play forever , this is how it goes ?
even when you were growing up and practicing , what kind of would be the longest you played tennis continuously , comparing it to the two guys on court ?
are you completely fit now in your own mind ? are you absolutely sure you 're fit ? how much has it taken for you to get back to that position ?
i was thinking more of the surgery you had .
when the ball 's bouncing close to the baseline around the brown spots , are you starting to get bad bounces ?
do you feel the courts are playing fairly fast because of the weather ?
there was a point in the second game of the second set where your opponent went to the replay . it showed that your shot landed a good foot inside the baseline . she seemed to clearly think that either the technology was malfunctioned or had shown the wrong replay . what was your view of that ?
do you generally trust the system a hundred percent ?
given the severity of your injury , the difficulty of the comeback from that type of injury , how much do you think about a possible future without tennis ? what options did you think about for the future ?
how special does it feel to reach the third round , given what 's happened to you over the last couple of years here ?
perhaps you did n't have a chance to see the queen because you were playing , but what do you think of the visit ?
what do you think the importance of that isner match is to the sport ? what effect do you think it will have ?
putting yourself aside , it has n't been a great year for russian women . can you put your finger on it at all or do you think things tend to be cyclical ?
congratulations . how was your match today ?
how do you find your game suited for grass , which is a special surface ?
what are your big weapons when people say your game is perfect for grass ?
caroline .
playing against caroline next , how do you see that match ?
how do you mentally prepare knowing that the last couple times , as you said , you 've been losing against caroline ?
what is it that is so hard to play against her since you 've been losing last three times ? what 's she so good at ?
do you have a secret weapon in your bag that you can take out this time that you did n't have before , maybe do something different in the match compared to the last three ?
when you say that you have to stay on top of your level all the time during the match , some opponents have described her like playing against a wall . do you feel it on court as well ?
is it harder or easier to develop yourself as a player given that there 's been so many great women players from russia ? is it more or less pressure ?
in some smaller countries it 's not expected that the best women players will get up to top 10. but for russia , i would think the bar , the level , is pretty high , because you 've had grand slam champions and no.1 players , right ?
so that 's what you 're aiming for , to be maybe top 10 and then top 5 ?
i mean in the world , not in russia . top 10 or top 5 in the world .
when you 're at home , do you get questions about is it time for you now to be one of the top players , especially with - svetlana has n't been playing that well this year and dinara has been hurt and now dementieva is hurt . do you hear a little bit of that ?
now you feel like you have to be more patient with yourself and then the results will come ?
but when you get questions about caroline , who 's close to you in age , do you think if i really play my best i can win matches like that now ?
that was a pretty decisive performance out there . you must be really pleased ?
you must be particularly happy with the way you were serving today .
were you preferred to have been in the other half of the draw so you get to play for the queen tomorrow ?
do you have a better curtsy than serena ?
she 'd win a curtsy-off with you ?
what do you make of serena not playing on centre tomorrow ?
is she going to be disappointed ?
if she 's been practicing her curtsy , presumably she would have been hoping to play on centre , maybe expecting it ?
have you talked about it at all ?
how about your football watching ? have you been closely following the match ? serena seems to be going berserk .
were you aware that england were playing while you were playing ? maybe there were n't as many people on centre court as there might be at other times you played .
did you sense the crowd was at all quiet or distracted ?
what 's the state of your game right now ?
how do you think you 're playing ?
could you talk about one or two things in your game that grass really emphasizes ?
you say 'living for the point . ' does that reflect a change of strategy on your part ?
is that something you 've always done , always come naturally to you ?
john isner is in a match right now , something like 33-all in the fifth set . what do you think of that ?
is that a good thing for spectators ?
serena called it isner versus mahot on her twitter page . she called him mahot .
what is your biggest problem in the first week ? is it concentration or are you trying to build yourself up gradually ?
how did you think that went for you today ?
are you still trying to readjust to grand slam tennis or do you find it 's a bit like riding a bicycle ?
winning any tournament is obviously key . this one has escaped you in the past . does this one have an extra special yearning for you ?
kim says she likes being at wimbledon because you can set up a family home and go around .
you 're a great student of the game . some have said recently it 's become more a game of veterans , of the older players . a teenager has not won a grand slam since maria at the us open in '06 . can you try and analyze why the veterans have been doing so well ?
do you find it interesting for many years it was a sport of teenage phenoms like hingis , seles , graf , all the way back to evert . that sort of has changed .
what are your thoughts on one of the players who did well here , won a championship , but has had injuries , maria sharapova , who is at the other end of the end from you , a big hitter , like the williams sisters ? how would you describe her game and what she means to the tour ?
when you were out of the game , was it very frustrating ? did you think about the fact that you were so close but never won the title ?
do you think the frustrations from all the points you mentioned from '06 , will that always be with you until you win the championship ?
are you pleased with your performance today ?
have you completed your adjustment to grass ?
what 's given you that better attitude on grass than you had earlier ?
is playing on grass the most fun just because it 's soft ?
what are the changes you have to make for moving on the grass ?
when justine was in here a little while ago , she spoke about the phenomenon of the veteran players doing well at the top of the tour , and very few players who are very young are achieving what your group did earlier . do you have any feelings about this or explanations for it ?
how do you feel about all that ?
from the british point of view , having been around a while , do you have any inkling yourself why british women have n't done well this year and tend not to do well this year ?
a little bit too easy ?
what is it they did in belgium ?
have you thought yet about the prospect of playing justine ?
you were wearing a dress by stella mccartney . do you think women 's fashion is important in tennis ?
i wanted to ask you a question about the tour . you 've had a great early career , reaching no.2 , great run in new york . you 're not going to be a teenager much longer . there really has n't been a big breakthrough by a teenager on the wta tour since maria here . why do you think that is ?
i do n't mean this in a negative way . what are your thoughts that the two finalists from roland garros have now lost here first round ?
sam stosur is of polish origin . are you ever going to get together and talk about your heritage ?
why do you think so many of polish heritage have come on recently ?
tell us what you were pleased about what you were doing and maybe there were things that displeased you .
any displeasure , besides falling down , perhaps ?
what about her power ? you seemed to be having quite a baseline battle at some stages . you had to work pretty hard .
can you talk us through your outfit today .
your nails look good today .
are you watching the world cup and watching america ?
do you know who is going to win ?
what are your thoughts about thursday with the queen 's visit and how are your curtsy practices going ?
what will it mean for you to have her here for your match ?
when you were a child , did you think that wimbledon was a place that the queen always came ?
what sort of outfit do you think would be suitable to wear on thursday then ?
can you explain the rationale behind your outfit today ? generally , how do you go about choosing what you wear before a major grand slam ?
your serving stats today were pretty eye-popping . was there a particularly special rhythm out there ? did you feel different at all ?
do you have a sense of what your record is in majors in first and second rounds ? do you remember ever losing in the first or second round ?
what does that say about your concentration in those first two rounds when some players have some problems ? we saw roger federer almost get knocked out yesterday .
the crowd really got behind your opponent today . did you notice that at all ? did it bother you ?
is your curtsy where you want it ?
just a little less forced ?
you 're going to watch the usa football game . what 's the tension like for you when you 're watching the usa team ?
could n't have been much easier , could it ?
physically , are you almost a hundred percent fit ?
when you wake up in the morning , does the shoulder still hurt to kind of start the day ?
when then ?
have you gotten to talk to sasha much about his championship and did you get to watch any of the parade online or anything ?
kobe is such an incredible athlete , the way at crunch time he gets the ball , works with his teammates . do you see any of that in tennis ? do you see any of that in federer ? do you learn from that ?
this may be pushing it , but the lakers did such a great job of coming back from seeming to be out of it from boston . are you particularly proud of the way you 've been fighting to come back ?
i do . i think it 's a real determination that you have .
i wanted your thoughts on that .
do you feel like anything is missing from your game now , or do you feel like you 're at the point where you can really contend ?
but are your very good days at the point where you feel like , yeah , if i play my best now , i really can beat anyone again ?
are you confident in your serve now ? how much more so than , say , a year ago ?
what motion ? is it still the shorter motion ? have you gone back to the old motion ?
maria ?
why are n't you in the florida sun right now ?
a couple things coaches ca n't teach . you refuse to lose and you do n't complain .
i also would like to compliment your coach about the great job he does with you .
it 's just fantastic . the tour needs you . i 'm delighted for how you 're playing again .
how has your perspective on tennis and maybe beyond tennis changed through what you 've gone through since your injury ?
yes .
perspective on your own role in tennis , on your enjoyment of tennis , and what it takes to play it .
to what degree do you consider the possibility of not being able to come back the way you have ?
are you surprised there are n't more teens breaking through like you did here a few years ago ?
why do you think we are n't seeing more teens that are able to do that these days ?
what went wrong today ?
did it cloud your mind the fact there was no british winner yesterday ?
elena was in a similar situation yesterday , serving for the match in the second set . she went on to lose . do you think british players have a temperament problem ?
yes .
when you got tight , how do you try to dig yourself out of a position like that ?
this is n't your first wimbledon . are you disappointed that your nerve did n't hold a bit better ?
was it difficult to keep your focus when your opponent was losing her head ?
this time last year when you exited , you obviously were very upset . do you feel similar emotions this time ?
in some ways is the feeling worse , because in the third set you did have a great chance , did n't you ?
what did you think when that dead net cord dropped to give her the breakpoint ?
do you think she should have been warned for her temperament ? it started to be excessive .
at what point did the nerves set in ? did you look up at the scoreboard , see you were 4-0 ahead ? is that when it started ?
obviously you 're disappointed on a personal level . how depressed are you on a more general level that once again we talk about a british failure for british tennis at wimbledon ?
are british players under too much pressure to perform at wimbledon ?
in the mirror today , you were pictured putting a custard pie in the face of one of the paper 's reporters . do you feel like doing that again ?
he 's coming tomorrow .
what about the crowd today ? you 've been critical of crowds at wimbledon in the past .
what about the umpiring ? you got a couple of fairly dodgey calls in the second set , a couple of glares to the umpire .
you were disappointed to see that line judge moved for the third set ?
it 's obviously been another emotional defeat . is it the sort of thing that will make you shed a tear in private , in the locker room , or when you go home tonight ?
were you happy with the way the game went tonight ?
how does that affect the game when you have such a long wait ?
you started off with a vengeance . was that something that was building up inside you , the frustration of waiting ?
good to get that first round out of the way .
what were the conditions like on the court ?
you 'll see a more muted response here to what you were wearing here than in paris ?
how inspired by her ?
you have makarova in the next round . great form at the moment . is that going to be a difficult one ?
do you feel as good going into this wimbledon as you have done in the past when you 've gone on to win it ?
shifting to the us open for a moment , as you look back on that tournament , you 've had so many great memories there . is there one that stands out ? might it be the first time you got to the final losing to hingis , the year you won your first title ? is one memory particularly powerful for you ?
and you had a comeback in the second set . it was a good performance .
against lindsay .
when you were waiting around , did you find yourself watching some of the federer match ? is that what people were doing in the locker room ?
you do n't like to watch another match before you go on ?
some people say it makes them more nervous . some people say they do n't care . you 're in the middle , i guess ?
sport and tennis is a game of highs and lows . i guess you 've gone from being incredibly high in paris last month to being very disappointed today . what went wrong out there for you ?
how has the last month since paris been for you ? how have you celebrated ? what have you done to get focused again ?
you must be fairly pleased with that ? certainly gave her a run for her money in the second set .
did you enjoy the occasion , playing on centre court ?
she was very complimentary about your serve today . said she has n't come up against a serve like that from someone your age ever before . was that particularly a good day ?
13 .
a big court . it was an important opponent . but you seemed to play with no fear out there .
what kind of things will you have picked up from that experience , playing against a player of that stature , the sort of things that it 's going to take for you to compete at that level ?
did jelena offer any words of encouragement after the game , compliment you on your efforts at all ?
after the match , did she compliment you at all .
how did your coach and family think you got on ? were they pleased with your efforts ?
long term , do you think grass will be your best surface ?
you 're in the mixed . are you going to play in the junior singles here ?
do you think you 're at the stage where playing juniors , you 're not necessarily going to be learning much more ?
so why might you not play juniors then ?
have you experienced any unfriendliness from the other girls on the tour by calling them sluts in that magazine ?
was it taken out of context ?
last year you were here , you 'd just done your gcses . are you going to do a levels , university ?
is that your priority at the moment , your tennis ?
how much time are you spending at the moment in paris ?
have you thought about your schedule after wimbledon at all ?
how will you spend your prize money ?
why not ?
how old will you have to be before you get your hands on your prize money ?
it 's up to mum and dad ? are they the ones looking after it ?
they 're in control ?
sounds like you 're comfortable out there on centre court . can you see yourself hopefully playing a lot there in the future ?
we 'd all like to see you one day win wimbledon . it would be brilliant .
when do you think ? you do n't have a crystal ball , but ...
is it an unexpected comeback ? was there point where you thought , i 'm going home ?
did you see any particular weaknesses in her that made you think , ah , i 've got a chance now ?
are you surprised how quiet the crowd was considering it 's a british player ? it was n't very loud for her .
do you think that worked to your advantage ? this was your first time playing at wimbledon , whereas there was a lot more pressure on baltacha .
elena , she obviously often goes to the back of the court in between the points and stands and looks at the wall . is that quite difficult for the opposition ?
it was your first match here . did it reach your expectations ?
how did you see that match ?
what do you think of laura 's potential ?
what do you need to sharpen up in your game then ?
can you remember coming up against a girl of that age with a serve as good as that ?
is this the trickiest grand slam for you ? because you say you have to adapt fast to grass and get your act together as quick as possible .
would it be to you the most elusive of all the grand slams for you to win , the most difficult to win ?
you have excellent movement , though .
you know what it takes to get into the top 10 , top 5. do you think laura could follow at some stage ?
where do you think you had the advantage today ? you said in the rallies you felt you had an advantage .
is that because her movement is not as good as yours ?
you 're noted for your great backhand down the line . you had 12 winners with your forehand down the line today . i thought that was well done by you in thinking of going down the line with the forehand . proud of you today doing it .
obviously laura is a young player making her way in the game . among the senior pros , she made some quite controversial comments in a magazine last month . i wonder what the senior pros on the tour made of those ?
how does it feel to be back at wimbledon ?
when you were not here , what did you miss the most ?
trying to win here was your major motivating force i think for coming back . does that put a lot of pressure on you ?
you showed a lot of fight and determination out there today against an opponent on a high from winning roland garros . what game plan did you come in with ?
i think the key game in the second set was when you saved four breakpoints at ...
yeah . was that a key part of the match ?
when you knew she was gon na be your first-round opponent , how did you feel ?
your victory is still a surprise to a lot of people , i think .
you have n't yet been beyond the second round at wimbledon . is this year gon na be your time ?
so you 're saying that even though francesca won the french open and played so well there , you were n't frightened at all or even daunted by the prospect of playing her the first round here ?
so her form at paris , you did n't think about that at all ?
what , in your mind , do you think was the key to that third set , because you absolutely dominated in the third set ?
what are your thoughts on what 's taken place with the french team in the world cup ? if you 've already addressed this in french , i apologize .
do you have any reaction to the government getting involved with the situation with the team ?
is there a greeting or message you would like to send to the players of the french team ?
you served at 5-3 , i think .
you must have felt that you were close then .
you served very well up until that point . you 'd only faced one breakpoint until the end of the second set and saved that with an ace . is it just that form comes and goes in the middle of a game ? you had n't tweaked anything ?
did you feel yourself becoming tight right at the start of that game ?
yes .
with all respect , why would you be nervous against a girl that never played at wimbledon before when you 're about to serve for the match ?
do you feel under more pressure because you went into the match , you were n't the underdog this time ?
you seem remarkably , impressively matter of fact about it . are you sort of somewhere inside a lot more disappointed and putting on a brave face ?
so wimbledon is not the be-all and end-all ?
if nerves affected you at all , is that something you can do work on in the future or work with somebody already to help conquer that ?
is there someone in your team that specifically deal with minds ?
bearing in mind all the stick that british players got last year , i know you were one of the few british winners , was that on your mind at all ? has that been a subject of conversation amongst the british players ?
you left the court for a comfort break after the second set . are you allowed to speak to nino after the break ?
what did you say to yourself during the break ?
petra said on court she felt that because the british crowd were quite quiet , she felt like she was playing at home . do you think that 's a fair reflection ? there was n't enough roar for you ?
would you like more vocal support sometimes ?
what would you hope to achieve by the end of the year ?
are you defending many points between now and the us open ?
so a good chance to be in the top 50 by then perhaps ?
seemed right from the outset that you seemed to struggle right the way through . partway through you were coming back , and then you backed off . take us through the game .
you had your coach come out a few times to sort of give you some sort of advice , et cetera . if you had the match again , would you do anything different based on what he was telling you to do ?
what was he telling you ? can you say ?
at the second game on the third set , you have a little problem with something in your racquet . you had the break and ...
second set give us the impression it would be an easy third set for you . is it clijsters ' experience that plays here , to make your defeat ?
have you learned anything as a result of today 's game ?
what tournaments are you going to play in australia before the australian open , if any ?
is it possible you 'll have time off , or you 're definitely playing one of the tournaments there ?
does losing today your match has affects on being the first in ranking , or no ? does losing today the final match of the championships has affects on being the first in the ranking professional ?
but psychological ?
is there a reason why you start slowly ?
can you talk about nerves in general during this final ? were you tense all the way ? and then when you came back in the second set , did you feel you had the momentum ? obviously you had it .
how satisfying is this one compared to the first one a few years ago now ?
this year , five finals . what 's the key for you ?
given that you have n't played since the us open , is there any sense in which you surprised yourself winning here , or did you always think you could get over that obstacle ?
can you put a couple of words on caroline 's performance today and compare the match a bit to the match you had a year ago in new york ?
correct me if i 'm wrong , this is your first appearance in doha and the big title . is it a good sign for you to come back again ?
back to the game again . it is relatively easy , your first set , and then the second set you were leading , what happened in that game ?
regarding your opponent , wozniacki , is it lack of experience that sets it for her today ?
how do you see her in general for the coming years ?
obviously the women 's tour fought a long time to have this two-month break at the end of the year . when you have a week like this at the end , are you kind of ...
you 're happy with a couple months off ?
when do you think you will start to perhaps concentrate or have a look again at your tennis ? maybe three weeks ?
have you had a chance to talk to your family back home ? were they able to watch the match on tv today ?
do you think caroline could feel extra pressure because she has something to prove because she 's no.1 ?
my question is as mother and as a champion in the same time , and for me as a new parent , how do you manage to be successful in the two jobs ? it 's a hard job to be a mother and to play in tennis .
next season caroline will start the season at no.1 , and all the public eyes will be on her because she 's not won a grand slam . what 's your advice to her ? she is still young and has something to learn , i guess , the .
when you became no.1 before winning a grand slam , did you feel extra pressure about that ?
well done .
that was an up-and-down match until you got on top . why did it switch backwards and forward like that ?
once you did that , was it mental that you were on top ?
can you speak about the final against kim , please .
after you played her in the us open , did you have a debrief afterwards to assess what you had done right and wrong ?
are you aware of what happened to kim on the way here today ?
the first set came down to a matter of millimeters . i guess you just were n't able to sustain that sort of intensity in the second set ; is that how you saw ?
overall , are you pleased that you finished the season on such a high to make the semifinals here ?
how important was it to finish the season with a couple confidence-boosting wins over top 10ers ?
and to feel you belonged , too . it 's your debut here , and yet you 're 2-4 , which is a good result .
what 's the plan now ? how many weeks off ? what do you plan to do ?
is there something specific you 're going to work on when you get back on the court in december ?
obviously your season is only just finished now , but it 's been a bit of a dream season for you . i guess you would have taken it at the start of the year .
and the australian open , is that the surface that suits you next best after the french , say ?
what was kim 's main weapon today ?
another question already leading up to 2011. australian open , we from belgium , when we come in australia we often hear kim being called aussie kim . is that true ? is she still considered like an aussie ?
but do aussies use the nickname aussie kim ?
a follow up what you said before about every slam being tough . does the degree of difficulty increase because it 's your home slam , do you think , from experience now ?
tell us about the car crash .
so a truck crashed into you at a roundabout ?
no cuts or anything like that ?
did that contribute at all to being 3-love down , do you think ?
and the first set clearly decided the match . that was the pivotal kind of time in the match , late in the first .
sorry to go back to the accident again , was it very close to the stadium ? were you almost here ?
but there are sort of four or five , are n't there , from the ritz carlton ?
did you carry on in the same car you were in ?
the car was completely banged and you had to get in a new one ?
so a little bit of a shock . not what you want really .
so very happy to be in the final then ?
looking forward to the journey back to the hotel ?
was it a big truck or small truck ? what was the size of the vehicle that hit you ?
you mentioned yesterday that you were feeling a little bit tired . what is the difference with the way you were feeling out there on court today physically and mentally ?
give us a little bit of a critique of sam . it 's her first year in the championships and her first year in the top 10. how do you feel her game has come along ?
and would the australian open suit her ?
considering you have n't played at all since the us open , how pleased are you that you 've managed to reach the final here ?
congratulations . you 're getting stronger by the day . with the heat , how do you feel you 'll cope with your stamina by sunday hopefully ?
are you hopeful of winning the championships ?
you play wozniacki tomorrow . us open you won in straight sets ; beijing you lost in straight sets . can you talk a little bit about the ups and downs in your matches ?
is that what 's going to be the key of the match , who 's able to play her own game ?
does it mean anything special that it 's a match between no.1 and 2 in the world ?
how much have you seen of caroline 's matches in doha ?
so you thought that caroline 's level was the same as in china more or less ?
did you know before the match that it was the last ?
what is your feeling ?
well done . you kept your standard high right to the end today . could you say something ? this is the best year of your career . could you say something about that ?
why did it happen for you this year ?
why rather than previous years ?
you can understand , did you say ? did you say you can understand more things ?
for you , the year is not over . you have the fed cup final . can you tell us what is your feeling about this competition , and this final especially ?
why are you doing it ?
what ideas do you have for the future ? you say you want to explore new avenues . media ? coaching ? getting away from tennis altogether ?
in those circumstances , it 's tough , i know , but some of the tweets that have been coming in from all over the world , most seem to be why ? they ca n't understand why someone as who is talented as you and can still play at a very high level would decide that now is the time to stop playing . that seems to be the general feeling .
how will you occupy your time ?
so when you did the speech for amlie in paris , you already know for you ?
how do you want people remember you in the future ?
was there one match or one experience that - i guess it was this time last year - made you think , that 's it , one more year ? or did you just come to the conclusion when you were in the off-season and taking time off ?
stacey allaster said , this is your family ; please do n't go away , or do n't go away for too long . can you imagine being involved in the wta tour in some way in the future ?
i remember asking you at the start of the week how you thought you were going to do next year , and now i know why you said you did n't want to talk about next year .
but in terms of strength of the game , how strong do you think women 's tennis is and can become with some of the young players coming into the game right now , someone like caroline wozniacki , for instance , the new no.1 ?
does stop playing tennis in not a big country , in qatar , mean anything for you ?
when you came into the top part of the game , you were a major part of what was , you know , probably wrongly called at the time , the russian revolution . there was so many of you girls coming through at the same time . do you see now that russia is going to carry on producing such a number of top-class players , or do you think it 's going to be more maybe china or places like that that bring numbers of players through ?
you said that if you were a man you would play on forever , and you got some big changes in your life coming up . can we assume you 're looking to start a family in the future ?
which is the best moment in your sports career that you would never forget it ?
what were the biggest disappointments in your career , that french open against anastasia ?
you 'll be playing sam stosur ; you 've got a pretty good record against her . how do you feel good into that match ?
what did you learn from the new and improved sam stosur in your us open win over here ?
when did you know about elena 's decision ?
which was your reaction ?
elena indicated she hopes to start a family , and she 's at the stage of life where she wants a big change . you 're a mother who 's come back to the tour . what advice would you give her in terms of what to expect with motherhood and whatnot ?
it 's fair enough to say it was a pretty good career move for you , was n't it ?
you 're not the only one who won this championships before , the only one be in semifinal . it was a long time ago , but do you think you are in the mood or fit to go get this championship again after these years ?
very well done . what was your predominant emotion ? relief ? delight ? what ?
we keep hearing player after player after player saying , i do n't take any notice of the rankings . numbers do n't matter . do they ?
were you aware of all the mathematics going on when you walked onto court ?
was it especially pleasing today that she made you play so well to have to win the match ? so for all that was on the match , you actually had to play some brilliant tennis to win it .
it 's a remarkable turnaround from last year when you were hit by cramp and abdominal problems . this year you look much stronger physically . even tonight you looked stronger as the game was going on . what do you put that turnaround to ? is it increased training or better scheduling ?
you quite enjoy going into shops and getting the credit card out . are you planning any present for yourself for ending the year world no.1 ?
i think you told me .
your dad seemed to get quite animated at one stage . was what was he saying ? anything different ?
do you think you 're now able to perhaps play with even more freedom at the weekend now that you know exactly where you stand ?
does it mean something to earn the no.1 by winning today , versus if you would have lost you could have still become no.1 ?
and in terms of if you win this , there 's all this talk of you have n't won grand slam , so should she be no.1 . this is a pretty big tournament . to win this , do you think that will put some of those skeptics to rest , or is that really even something to think about ?
you did n't quite have the same intensity tonight . where did you feel it went awry ?
were you aware that you just needed to win one set to get through to the semis ?
was it hard to pick yourself up for the second set ? must 've been quite excited .
must be a great thrill to get through to the semifinals . first australian in plenty of years .
quite a few legends on the honor role . have you actually had a look at the honor role ?
you have ice on your knees . is that standard after match , or a new injury you 've picked up ?
got any preference for who you would like to face in the semifinals ?
physically how are you holding up after the three matches , and is it a good time to have a day to prepare ?
does losing stall your momentum or jolt your confidence going into the semifinals ?
do you want to thank your friends and family for your latest award .
you are quite a sort of private person and a little bit reserved on the outside . there 's that sort of perception of you . do you get any more comfortable with this kind of thing now ? i think that award involves media stuff as well and sponsor appearances . are you growing into that side of being a top 10er ?
you already told us that you do not really have any preference of your opponent . is n't there any of the three players who are still doing well in the other group you do not like ?
you had a pretty unlucky matchup with kim clijsters at the us open .
you missed an opportunity , i guess . do you think it 's like that ? do you see that match like an opportunity you missed ?
yeah .
was it even more sore to see her winning the us open afterwards ?
coming in here with not great form , would you have taken a semifinal if someone offered it to you at the start ? would that have been enough for you to be satisfied with the results of the week ?
you play a very beautiful first set ; what happened after ? you have a little bit less level ?
what 's happened at the beginning of the third set when you have something in your hand ?
you have a ball for 2-2 at the third set . do you think it was the turning point of the last set ?
tomorrow you have to play a special match because you are no more in the competition , but i suppose you want to win , so ...
you play strong match . tell us about this game .
your preparations for the second game , what do you expect ?
yeah .
do you have any expectations who will be the winner ?
you play twice with stosur this year , and probably two of the best match of the year . what 's special when you play ?
the longest and also the best .
the last part of the third set you were stretching a bit . cramping ?
what was wrong in that third set ?
was it a matter of not having eaten enough or dizziness ? because the downfall was rather spectacular , the difference ?
you a big grace jones fan then ?
i see . because she goes to a lot of tennis events .
yeah .
that was a good , gutsy win out there today , was n't it ?
you spoke at wimbledon and you spoke a little bit after the us open about getting tougher , about really coming through in these clutch matches . this is n't a final , i know , but this is the end of the year . every match counts . is this evidence of you getting tougher ?
another way of asking that , coming out of that match , what did you learn from tonight ? you were down most of the match and kept fighting back . what do you take away from that , and how will that help you in the upcoming matches ?
who is the best tennis player in the world ?
who will be the best on monday ?
you do n't have any guess ?
did you play in your mind the idea that if you lose , you lose the no.1 , the possibility to be no.1 ?
last night you talked about consistency , and you were struggling with that . obviously that was a problem in the first set . what 's the problem with consistency in the first two matches ? as you get further into the week , is that something that 's a little bit worrying to you ?
sorry to come back to the old , old , old question about is the season too long and everything like that , but are you looking forward to a break now , or with your form getting better and better , would you like to go on for another couple of weeks yet ?
did you field tired ? worn out ? do you feel you need a rest ?
if you have to lose a match , is it better to lose it in a group where you can repair the damage ?
was a crucial moment those sort of two or three moments towards the end of the first set where you had the chance to get to breakpoint and did n't quite make it ?
did it ever creep into your mind that you could be year-end world no.1 ? was that a factor at all ?
was it more of a case that she played a really good match or you were making a lot of mistakes or combination of both ? she seemed to have a really good forehand and serve going .
what will you take from it to help you play better tomorrow ?
back to the issue of no.1 . the scenario is the this complicated scenario where you only have to win one more match to secure it . does that weigh on your mind at all , or is that something you just do n't factor in when you go on the court ?
this was even better than yesterday . you must be pretty thrilled .
i guess in this sort of form you must be able to think you can go all the way .
obviously it 's been a season of firsts . you 've won against two world no.1s this year . that 's another feather in your cap .
what was your strategy for the match today ?
it seemed to me as if you played a lot on her forehand . was that on purpose ?
did it surprise you that she did n't have any answer to your very aggressive play ?
you seemed quite controlled tonight . you though you were going to be able to hit more winners than her , but the errors were kept pretty well under wraps .
are you surprised by how well you 've been able to turn it around ? you did n't come in with the greatest form .
and you 're going to be up first tomorrow . is that going to upset your rhythm at all ?
when you did n't come into the press conference last night , we kind of assumed you might withdraw from the tournament . were you close to doing that , and are you glad you carried on ?
is that it ? are you going to carry on and try and play the three ?
you told us that you were sick in moscow and everything . what actually is the problem at the moment ?
i guess with all the rules and everything , you ca n't take very much to help yourself .
how do you feel after this first match ?
you seem to be moving really well out there . did n't seem to be any hesitation or anything because of your foot injury .
what is your sense now ? do you think you could win ? will you win this championships after coming out and getting back into it ? do you think it is something you can win ?
the one that thing that stood out is the double faults . what happened there ?
you said that you have a lot of time for you . is it good your tennis , or sometimes the time is too long for you here ?
you said you have a lot of time because you 're not with your family here . is it good for your tennis ?
it must be very tough to lose a game like this , such a close game in difficult conditions .
two hours and 17 in this heat . will it affect you for your next match tomorrow against clijsters ?
you beat clijsters already in eastbourne , i guess . at the other hand , in miami you had almost no chances against her . what was the difference between these two chances ?
yes .
in the second set .
you 're just arriving here from a very good week . tell us about the state of mind and how tired or not tired you are physically and mentally at this stage .
that match worked out very well for you , did n't it ?
what does it feel like out there ? is it very humid ?
did you get a feeling that you were actually getting right on top right early in the match ?
what do you think changed between the first and second set ? do you think she got a little bit tired , or were you just doing some things you were n't doing in the first set ?
as you look ahead , what are some things you would like to improve upon ?
you had an early day start , the first day start . this means that you may have one day off if you reach the semifinal . is this an advantage ?
wozniacki also wins her match quickly . does this mean that the world class players do n't find it difficult to win their match versus to the other players ?
yesterday you told us about the internet polls about best-dressed male player and most popular male player . who did you vote for ?
who would you vote for ?
and best-dressed player ?
what do you think about your match tomorrow against azarenka ?
she 's coached by your former coach . does that make it a little bit strange , to see him in the stands for your opponent ?
last year you replace safina , and this year you are one of the best favorite of the tournament . how do you consider this situation ?
perfect start ?
you 're used to it , you played here last year . coming from other tournaments , coming to this one and going back outdoors again , is that a tough thing for you ?
bit more of a general question . at what point in your career did you think , i can be the world no.1 ?
so since so since you were a girl ?
dementieva wozniacki is a big match . were you disappointed by the number of empty seats ?
can you run us through love-4 down ? i think you had won three points at that stage . what was going on ?
was it nerves or something else , do you think ?
overall then , how did you rate it ?
how much confidence does it give you to come back from love-4 against a grand slam champion ?
you have an opportunity tomorrow to delay the world no.1 for caroline .
if you look at your type of play , very aggressive , going for the big shots , caroline is almost the opposite , very solid , consistent player . how do he see those two types of players collide tomorrow ?
you say the conditions are on your side . what do you mean ? can you elaborate on that ?
what do you think you do better than wozniacki ?
from your matches earlier , what do you remember from those matches ?
you played here a couple of times in doubles . this is your first match in the singles championships . how was it to be alone out there on court ?
getting back to the first set , when you were down love-4 , what was going through your mind ? how did you dig out of that ? what do you take away from that for the rest of the week ?
you started so well . what do you think turned the match around ?
i 'm not sure if you were asked this , but up 4-0 in the first set and losing 6-4 , what was going through your mind ? what was the conversation you were having with your coach between sets ?
mentally was it hard losing the first set when you were up 4-0 ? were you finding it hard to come back and get motivated in the second set ? what was your thinking coming in ?
how is your ankle ? having problems ?
the weather condition are different before today or not ?
the weather was different last days , or same ?
you play a lot of dropshots . it was your game plan or just a choice in this moment ?
you said weather conditions were tough here . is that the key of who 's going to win the tournament , who 's the best to cope with that ?
but it 's not the first time you competed here , so you must be sort of used to the heat here .
is this a new style of serving ?
next match is francesca schiavone . do you think you are ready to play against her ?
pretty ordinary conditions out there ? not much fun ?
frustrating when you 're trying to be attacking in those sort of conditions because you have such a small margin of error ?
is your mind already on wimbledon today ? the draw is out . any part of that today ?
in view of the conditions , how good of preparation is this for wimbledon ?
do you think this is perhaps the most open wimbledon for some years for women ?
a question regarding serena williams , how did you find her here , her games ?
how bad is it ?
what are your plans between now and maybe your first match ?
what do you feel the odds are to be able to play ?
would you say the windy conditions would have had anything to do with it ?
it makes it extra frustrating , because you were playing so well .
it 's hard because of the mental -- i mean , the physical side you can hopefully get right , but it 's the mental effects of it .
do you feel you made it worse by playing on after it happened ?
is it an injury you 've had before ?
difficult conditions out there , venus ?
she got a lot of balls back .
do you think you 've had enough grass court practice for wimbledon ?
i suspect it 's not very often you hit a serve and it comes off the frame and goes ...
you seemed to play a bit better when the sun came out . in the second set i think you broke back after the sun came out again .
do you feel you came out a little bit slow ? you seemed a little bit sluggish in the first set .
how are you physically feeling ?
what 's it like when you have been out for a few months and then start playing again ? you must be sore and stiff in the morning .
are you surprised at the speed of your progress considering how long you have been out ?
is that how you feel about wimbledon now ? you 're going in there under no pressure , sort of under the radar , really ?
you have only played grand slams for the last year or so . is that going to be the future or ...
why do you think you 're able to , after such a long time out , to come back and play as well as you have , and serena ?
a lot of players could n't , could they ?
would you have come back so soon if it had n't been wimbledon ?
you said when you arrived that you were determined to try and win wimbledon this year . having played your matches here -- that was before you played your first match . how do you feel now ? are you still as determined you 're going to win ?
what are you going to do the next few days , go straight up to wimbledon tonight and be on the practice courts tomorrow ?
are you going to physically be at wimbledon tomorrow ? are you going to be staying there tonight ?
dinner in southwest england ?
do you and serena , in the days before a match , spend much time together ? or do you get into your own bubbles really and have your own focus ?
she said yesterday she did n't want to meet you too early in the tournament , but you could , with the seedings , could be early as third round , could n't it ?
you do n't mind ?
what have you and serena done to help each other ? you know , what have you said to each other ? what have you done to each other through the bad times ?
what do you sing ?
you must have enjoyed that today .
you 're having a great run .
is this the best you 've felt in quite a while ?
did you feel you had to beat two opponents , the wind and venus ?
mentally , you played her 10 times . you have n't done too well against her in those matches . how do you go into the 11th match ?
what do you think of her comeback ?
you have obviously been playing really well the last few weeks and months . what 's made the difference ?
why do you think you handled the wind so much better than she did today ?
do you feel you 're in as good of form as you 've ever been entering a grand slam ?
your next opponent is petra kvitova . not an easy match .
venus told us she gets in the mood for matches by singing , blondie and things like that . do you have anything that you do to prepare yourself for a match ?
are you more happy or more tired ?
tough to close out , though , was n't it ?
she has a reputation for coming back from the dead and winning matches that she 's almost lost . was that a thought on your mind ?
the second match back after nearly a year , how do you assess her game ?
how do you think she 's playing compared to the wimbledon final last year ?
what 's the longest break that you 've had injury-wise , and how long did it take you after coming back after that break to feel yourself again ?
what did you like and what did n't you like in your match today ?
you 've obviously trained , had a big coaching change . what 's been the difference between before what you 're doing off court and now ?
obviously you had chances , especially in the first set .
what are your thoughts on the match ?
the match kind of ran away from you in the second set . did you get tired ?
what 's the biggest thing that 's changed in your life over the last week or so ?
how are you received back in china ?
obviously there will be a lot of attention on you . do you welcome that attention , or would you prefer to be more private ?
what are your thoughts on wimbledon now that you 've started playing the grass court season ?
how is china 's tennis at the moment ?
well , you must have an idea of how well the country is doing .
just generally , you know , is chinese tennis ...
going into the french open you said that you did n't even like clay and that maybe grass , you like grass . how do you feel about maybe the extra expectations from people and yourself going into wimbledon ?
you 'll be seen as one of your favorites because of your grand slam record this year and you 've already won a grand slam tournament . do you like being one of the favorites or does it matter to you ?
how did you start ? how did you start to go from -- what was your very first experience of tennis ?
did you ever think you would reach the level you have reached ?
regarding a resurgence -- i know you ca n't speak for china , but generally in the far east , do you feel there is a big interest , a swell of interest in the sport ?
it would be nice to have other players with you ?
no , i meant it would be nice if you had a few more chinese girls with you at big tournaments .
have you ever had to miss a tournament because you have n't got the visa ?
are you going to win wimbledon ?
it looked like you turned it around at the start of the second set , did n't it ?
looked like it was a good match to learn some stuff from .
you have had a lot of encouraging results this year , and the second set must be very encouraging ?
the draw is going to be quite big for you because the form you 're in , you do n't really want to draw a really huge name in the first round ?
would it be fair to say you 're not really afraid of anybody ?
do you think some younger players will look at you and sort of see what can be achieved with real hard work and sticking at it ?
because it 's not always the case , is it ? youngsters in tennis ...
how would you say the state of women 's tennis is now ? seems to be going on the ...
what are your thoughts and maybe advice on laura , who seems to have stalled a little bit at the moment ?
there is a lot to be learned about how not to get injured , as well , is it not ?
did you have any issues with the speed of your growth , which laura , she 's nearly 6 feet tall now , when you were 16 , 17 ?
how difficult was that first set for you ?
yeah .
were you sort of tentative , particularly with your serve ? you seemed to build up the speed as the match went on with the serve .
how would you sum up your first match ?
nothing beats competing , serena . what 's it like to actually be out there in a competitive environment again ?
were you nervous ?
what 's the difference between anxious and nervous ?
when you spoke to the umpire after the time violation , was that because she had n't given you any indication that she was going to do that ?
what do you remember of 1998 when you first came ?
you made a remark at the end about how i hope you guys will give me a cheer . was that because you felt the crowd had been a little bit tricky during the match ?
were you able to enjoy it today ?
it 's likely -- i think you 'll be playing a repeat of the wimbledon final probably rather quickly , more than you thought it might happen . memories of that day perhaps ?
it was over quite quickly .
you fell down in the last game . have you been told that it 's safe for you to do that now , or is it something you 've been told to avoid ?
well , the medical opinions , that it might be dangerous for you to fall .
how was your fall ? did you feel anything on the injured foot at all ? is it okay now ?
do you think had it not been grass you probably would n't have been playing yet ? is it because it 's the grass and you can perhaps get a bit more leeway with your movements and if you do fall , it 's a little more cushion than falling on cement , for instance ?
any thoughts about the length of the match and not having played so well and it was quite warm out there ?
did you have any nice messages , good-luck messages from friends in the states yesterday and today ?
are you slightly disappointed that andy murray did n't take you up on your invitation to come and do a little bit of ...
i wanted to know whether you designed your tennis dress , or is that part of your ...
what color would you use to describe it ?
brigitte bardot , perhaps ?
you had to fight pretty hard for that , did n't you ?
how did you feel about your serve ? you got less than half of your first serves in , but you only lost six points on your first serve .
i think it 's fair to say that most of us do n't really know what to expect each time you go out to play a match right now . you 've had some up-and-down results this year . what are your expectations when you go out there ?
are you happier with the progress you 've made in the past year in tennis on the different surfaces ?
what is going on coaching-wise at the moment ? you 're still using the adidas team , are you ?
what about down here ?
are you anywhere closer to getting anyone permanently ?
was that easier than you expected ?
is it easier to get up for another tournament so soon after winning one ?
azarenka next . what do you think of that ?
best form of your career , would you say ?
you must be very pleased with that .
was it slippery ?
no reaction from the injury ?
how frustrating have these last three months been for you ?
when you walked out on court for the match this afternoon , was there an element of nerves ? did you feel nervous the first match and all that ?
apart from the result , was it therapeutic to come back against andrea and sort of think , this is where i left off ?
how close do you think you are to being in peak form ? can you compete at wimbledon and get through to the final rounds ?
she 's ranked 11 , so she 's a good player , is n't she ?
you got a fantastic reception when you walked on court . everyone was delighted that you 're back .
was there a part of you that thought , you know , when you started with two successive double faults , it used to be easier ?
couple of months ago an all-williams final at wimbledon was probably a million-to-one shot . after today do you think we have chopped a few points off those odds now ?
how much practice have you been able to have on grass ? i mean , is eastbourne the first chance you 've had ?
it feels strange you and serena are playing an event before wimbledon . normally it 's on the hard courts in florida after the french you 're practicing .
do you have targets for wimbledon , or is it just basically , as you say , being there and being healthy ?
it 's a long time since you 've been here . i think it was '97 . is that the last time ?
have you got any recollections of that tournament ? i think you came through as a qualifier .
are you planning to play doubles again with your sister ?
how excited are you feeling to be back ?
what did you miss the most ?
how would you describe your condition at the moment ?
how long have you been practicing ? how long have you been just practicing ?
what made you want to come back and play here ?
venus says she 's here to win it and to win wimbledon . do you share those feelings ?
could you take us back to wimbledon last year and just your feelings , how delighted you were , and then just talk us through sort of the next couple of weeks after that .
would it be expecting too much for you to hit those spots again so soon after your injury ?
does it help you that venus is making the same sort of comeback as well ?
were you hitting against her in practice ?
is that because you get too competitive when you play each other ?
presumably this is nothing like when you came back after a long absence and won in australia ?
is it nothing like it , or is it a much tougher road you 've come back on ?
what did the doctors say to you in terms of how serious it was ? what were their words when they sort of explained things to you ?
yeah .
so they told you you were in fact quite lucky then in some respects ?
has what happened to you given you a new perspective at all on your career ?
when you go through something so serious -- welcome back , by the way -- do you think you 'll ever again find it easier to get worked up about a line call or a serve that does n't go where you want it to go ? are there aspects of your game that you wo n't be able to take so seriously again ?
how sure are you that these most recent health problems were linked to what happened in germany ?
what actually happened , then , if you could tell us about that evening ? do you remember what actually happened ?
with the bottle .
were you barefoot or have sandals on ?
what did you do with yourself when you could n't play ? i mean , how did you occupy your time ?
are you much of a spectator of tennis ? could you bring yourself to watch the us open , the australian , and the french ?
if , after all you have been through , in three weeks ' time you were to retain your wimbledon title , where would that rank in terms of achievement in your career ?
has the emotion of everything you 've been through , obviously the illness and the emergency surgery , has the emotion of that caught up where you thought , whoa ? has it come out in tears or any other ways ?
do you think tennis has missed you and your sister as much as you 've missed tennis ?
a great effort , but not quite good enough . how disappointed are you ?
yes . are you disappointed afterwards or are you taking positives out of it ?
were you tired in the last set ? it was a physical game . did you get tired and your concentration go a little bit ?
is that why you were talking to the umpire in the third set ?
what was the overall experience to be close to being the first asian to win a major championship ? you 're the first finalist anyway .
you lost eight points in a row at the beginning of the match . could you talk about how nervous you were .
you 're not nervous ?
what did you think after you lost the first two games , no points at all in two games ?
can you talk about the third set .
how much do you think the big match experience that kim has got played a role in the final under pressure and all ? did she benefit from that in the end ?
semis last year ; finals this year ; next year you win ?
what went through your mind when they presented you with the trophy ?
what about your emotions on receiving the trophy ?
do you feel really close to being able to do it ?
when you eventually get back to china , what sort of reaction are you expecting ?
it was said on court that you were declared a national hero in china today .
you 're more or less the same age as kim . she has a daughter three years old .
do you ever think about children ?
can you clarify what you said about your husband at the end of the game ?
what was the turning point in the game for you ? what changed the game ?
is there anything you think you 'll take away from this tournament as far as something you need to work on in your game ? anything in particular ?
where to next ?
kim 's coach once promised to shave his hair if she won a grand slam . was there any promise by your coach or husband if you had won this one ?
do you feel like this is your home grand slam ? do you feel more at home in melbourne than maybe wimbledon or new york or paris ?
have you always been somebody that is a stand-up comedian , as we would say , funny ?
you mean that 's your style ?
it 's very refreshing . we do n't get that very often .
a reasonable runner-up check . going shopping ? what are you buying ?
will you be back to defend the title next year ?
a tear in your eye at the end of the match . how emotional was your fourth grand slam win ?
how did you turn it around ?
was there anything you picked up in sydney on her game that you were able to use to your advantage tonight ?
we rarely see you so pumped up or emotional during a match . does this one mean more than some of the others ?
this year i read that this could be your last full-time year . then i read that you want to come back and play the olympic games very much next year . then that you may become a mother for the second time in 2013 and come back in 2015 .
how do you explain these grand slam wins to your daughter ? does she understand what you 've done tonight ?
li na said she felt like she was playing in belgium tonight .
because of the support for you . did you feel that ?
before your comeback you did n't go into the grand slams as the out-and-out favorite . the last two you have and you 've won . can you talk about contending with that feeling ?
tonight when you played the higher balls , eight times you made eight points . why since you know her you did n't start since the first set with your experience ? were you somehow tense or you did n't think ?
what happened to your teeth at the airport ?
are you going to name the mystery dentist ?
all in all , there were 13 service breaks . what do you think happened to your serve ?
how did your legs feel ?
would li na hit the ball as hard as serena williams at her best ?
how big of a goal is it to win roland garros and wimbledon ? are you playing for different things other than just major titles ? just for the love of competing , or would you really like to get those two other slams ?
what does it mean to finally win a grand slam outside new york ?
you had a great speech after the win . it was funny and well-said . i 'd like to know if you had to think much before when you started , or it came out like that ?
the aussie kim was just like that ?
will you be wearing green for the rest of the year in the grand slams ?
where did it get away from you ? you were serving for the match in the second set . what happened after that ?
if you could play the match again now , would you change anything ?
what makes her a difficult opponent ?
mentally did things change ? because first set and almost all the way to the match point , you were in control and you had depth hitting your forehand , your serve was great , and after you lost the match point it seemed like she took complete control of the match .
did you feel like you needed to play more aggressive in the third set ? you had so many more winners in the first and second set . in the third you had 0 and she had 15. probably not going to get it done for you .
the heat in the third set , did that affect you at all ?
you were making quite a lot of challenges in the third set . were you getting frustrated at all ?
i realize you 're a very tough person , but how emotional was it when you got off the court ?
do you feel like you have missed a good opportunity to win your first grand slam this time ?
do you think she 's playing the game to win on saturday ?
last night justine henin announced she will retire for the second time . what are your comments about this news ?
as the current no.1 and representing the current generation , is it a big loss to women 's tennis to lose justine henin ?
you mentioned before you like to learn something from that match . what could it be ?
last year you were in semifinals . now you are in final . what are you going to do next year ?
a lot of unforced errors early in the match . she served for the match . how did you turn it around ?
they call her the great danish wall , but you have the great chinese wall . so it was easy , no ?
and in few days there will be the year of the rabbit in the chinese calendar . you were running more than a rabbit today .
can you tell us about how you feel about making the final , what it means to you ?
why you 're not sure that it 's good for chinese tennis ? seems to be very good .
what do you expect ?
getting back to the match , was your game plan just to be very aggressive ? did you think you could outpower her ?
you said after the match you did n't get much sleep last night .
is he going to go into another room now ?
was it your wedding anniversary today , or is it saturday ?
you beat kim in the sydney final . you could play her in the final on saturday . what do you think about her ?
apart from playing well , do you think about what you can do for chinese tennis back home ? do you think of things you can do to help build the sport in china ?
you 've done a lot for chinese tennis . is that important to you ?
only women or also men ?
we never see any men play .
not because they 're small ?
do n't you think in men 's tennis you have to be stronger , physically big ?
does your husband have secrets to give you that strong fighting spirit ?
is it true that you 're not a typical chinese in the sense that you 're more extrovert ? you like to have fun , make jokes ? you 're not shy ? i mean , many chinese do n't talk this much .
you went down 5-love in the final in sydney in the first set , and you 've lost your first serve a few times here . is there any way you can think of you hope to make yourself get a better start in the final on saturday ?
compared to other players , maybe it took you a long time to get where you are right now . can you explain that little or let 's say huge step for you ?
did you change something for the last step ?
as you probably know , justine henin is retiring for good . do you think it 's a big loss for women 's tennis ?
because of her injury she ca n't play anymore . do you think it 's a big loss for women 's tennis ?
what distracted you at 3-love in the second set ?
was the key to your game today aggression ?
she came in very hot . she wins brisbane , upsets stosur , pennetta . you seemed to control the match today . talk about how you were able to do that .
you did n't have a great record against flavia pennetta . were you happy that kvitova beat her ? did you think about that ?
but still they are different players for you ? okay , you have to compete against everyone , you have to beat everyone . but there are players who give you more troubles than others . yes or no ?
did the attack in moscow affect your preparation for the match ?
there 's a lot of talk about who might win this tournament . do you think the fact that you reached the last two grand slam finals gets a bit forgotten sometimes ?
do you think you 're a better player for the experiences last year in those two finals ?
what is it like without serena in the draw ?
you beat kim three out of four times last year , but you lost obviously in the big final . so if you play her , can you talk about what you 're going to have to do to play your best ?
what can you tell us about kim , not only the player , but the woman as well ?
was there a particular turning point for you mentally in your career , any particular time ?
you 're talking about injuries . last week there was an american football player who quit in a very big game . a lot of people questioned how hurt he was . when do you decide whether you need to stop in a match ? does the process change in a major ?
if you were in a major final , would you be willing to be not smart about it ?
many players said they do n't read press , they do n't care what press writes , and then as soon as they finish to play tennis they become press . are you going to be one of those ? the second question is , would make bigger history in the media , from your point of view , a final victory of vera zvonareva who never won a slam or a victory of a chinese player who never won a slam ?
you just said you study economics . obviously you 've earned a bit of prize money being in two big finals . i 'm wondering if you started to invest your own money ?
a lot of players talk about having fun , how important it is to enjoy tennis . at a grand slam when there 's stress and anxiety , big matches , can you actually go on court two days from now and have fun , or is it just business ?
did you have to develop that , or has that always been that way for you ?
you had your chances and just could n't quite take them . what was your feeling on the game ?
both of you seemed to have trouble on your service games . what were the conditions like ?
this was your fourth grand slam quarterfinal . what do you have to do to take the next step ?
you had the planes flying overhead at a crucial time . did you know that going into the match , and did that distract you at all when you were out there ?
was it difficult to play through these planes ?
what made the difference today in the second set ? do you think kim was more consistent ?
is that the most different thing about playing kim : you have to run kilometers and kilometers ?
you are a very exciting player to watch . what do you expect of yourself ?
do you want to be in the top five in the next two years ?
was it nervous start for you today ? were you nervous when you went out there ?
do you need to play more big matches ? is it just a matter of experience for you to go further ?
what do you take from this tournament ?
did the distraction in the crowd , the 21 gun salute , put you off ?
did you struggle to concentrate with the planes overhead today ?
you said after the match you were not happy with your game . could you tell us why .
made a lot of unforced errors today . how much of that is a concern heading into a match against someone like vera ?
that bandage a carryover from your fourth round ?
just a protection thing ?
did you feel it at all today , the leg ?
your record against vera , she beat you three times out of the four , but you obviously won the us open final . what about her game is it that troubled you the other times ?
do you think your best tennis is better than her best ?
even though you are not ranked no.1 in the world , you play like it .
do you feel that you are no.1 in the world ?
vera spoke about how the two back-to-back grand slam finals have made her mentally tougher and more experienced . i guess you expect to see a different vera when you play her .
on the flipside of that , do you think your experience of having beaten her at the us open will work in your favor here ?
having said you need to improve on today , do you feel like you 're confident you can do that within the space of 24 hours ?
this wo n't be at the forefront of your mind , but can i ask you to think about the men 's draw . who do you think is going to win the men 's title ? roger ? rafa ?
how does the absence of serena affect the players ?
did your previous match have anything to do with your loss today ? were you a bit tired ?
can you compare the two atmospheres between the fourth round match and the quarterfinal today . did you feel as up as you did ...
you know what it takes to win slam . do you think caroline can do it here in melbourne ?
with kim and caroline in the final ?
is there anything she needs to do to try and elevate to take a title ?
are you proud of what you 've achieved here over the last ten days , or is it still a little bit disappointing at the moment ?
you were up 3-1 in the second set . suddenly you lost six games in a row . can you tell us what changed in that moment of the match ?
what is her tennis ?
can she win a major without getting more aggressive ?
yeah .
do you feel now that people will regard you as a threat on hardcourts much more than they did before ?
do you look at stats ? you had three times more winners than caroline , but you had three times more unforced errors than her . do you look at the stats after a match ?
is that the italian in you or just the way you were taught tennis just to go for your shots ?
do you think they should consider having tiebreakers in the third set at the australian open ?
you 're quickly gaining the reputation of being someone who plays matches and the fans tune in to see and get very excited about . do you get a sense that you 're fast becoming a fan favorite and the fans really like watching you play ?
can you explain what happened on that last point ? looked like you called it out , the hawk-eye point .
'cause you were calling it out , i think .
no , when your last shot went out .
but it was an overrule by the umpire .
no.4 in the world after this ; you 're smiling . you 're obviously pretty happy with that .
it 's the highest ever for an italian woman . how proud are you of that ?
next major is the french open . do you feel your emotions are already building towards that ?
for the english-speaking world , your next goal is to become no.3 or no.1 ?
you 're thinking now you 're a better player than the one who won the french ? i think so , but i want to hear your opinion .
your first grand slam quarterfinal . what was the experience like ?
you started the set well then fell away slightly . what happened ?
was playing in brisbane and coming to the final of brisbane , coming here , have you played too many matches ?
why are you so confident about li na ?
she seemed to impose herself once she got on top of you . did you feel that from the other end ?
what would you do differently ? tactically how would you change the match ?
were you having trouble serving at one end ?
how would you assess your start to the year and your goals going forward as a result of how you 've gone thus far ?
can you tell which parts of li na 's game is too strong to play ?
you have the confidence she can win the tournament , especially if she 's going to play wozniacki in the semis and also maybe kim clijsters in the finals ?
( question regarding novak djokovic being in andrea 's next yearbook . )
andrea said she thinks you can win the tournament ; you 're her selection . how do you feel ? can you go that extra step ?
it was a very good match for you today .
do you feel you 're playing a lot better this year than last year ?
in what way ?
have you felt any pressure about defending your points from here last year ?
when you went home last year after the semifinals , there was a very good reception for you . what do you think it would be like if you made the final ?
is your husband getting worried about the credit card , what you might do this year ?
you talked about when you took time off to go to university . when was that ? how has that influenced the way you approach your tennis career ?
do you feel that 's made you approach your tennis career entirely different now ?
what were you studying to be ?
what university was that ?
i believe your mother has never watched you play . what would it take to make her come watch you to play ? maybe if you make the final ?
we do n't know your opponent in the semifinal yet . if it should be caroline , how would you describe her ? can you take any confidence beating her last year ?
what would it mean to you to win this tournament ?
what does it take to beat caroline ?
will you watch the quarterfinal now or leave that for your husband and coach ?
what was your assessment of your game today ?
do you play better in the majors than the non-majors ?
do you get nervous in the majors ? what is your mentality in the majors different from the rest of the year ?
you 're no.2 in the world . you 've been to the final of the last two grand slams . do you like being kind of under the radar or do you think you deserve more respect ?
was that incentive that the people did n't believe in you ?
after what you said about playing in a grand slam , liking playing in a grand slam , your experiences last year when you made it to the final , does that help you this week in terms of getting your perspective and keeping yourself fresh ?
is it an opportunity for other players that serena were not here , or do you wish that she were here ?
that was a really tough match . what did you think of your game ? how did you see it ?
do you want to talk about the two match points you faced .
maybe next time you go into a grand slam , you should have no practice and no matches .
it 's pretty incredible , given what you went through in the fall , coming here and winning matches ?
can you think ahead a little bit and say that your level is very good ? can you maybe go further ?
do you want to talk about kim if you had to play her , what kind of challenge she would present to you ?
is it easier to come up with a great shot match point down than during the game ?
did you expect her to choke a little bit in the end or did you hope for it ?
did you watch schiavone and sveta yesterday ?
your thoughts on playing 4 hours and 44 minutes .
what is your record against kim ? have you ever played her ?
it was your first match at wimbledon , i guess , or second .
you won the first set , then what happened after that ?
did she improve or did your game drop away ?
where has she improved ?
after the attention and the hype around her last match , a win over stosur , did you think that could play into your hands , she might start slower ?
after her game against stosur saturday night , lots of attention on it , considered a big loss from australia 's point of view . did you think that might play into your hands , she might start slowly tonight ?
it was a very exciting and tough match . in the end you lost . why do you think you lost ?
this was your best performance at a grand slam . what have you learnt from it ?
what was the difference ? you played agnieszka at the us open . what was the difference between the game you played there and here ?
did you ask for any advice how to play her ?
it seems like you could n't show your best game today . is it true or not ?
do n't you have any regret ?
do you have any regret ? are you sorry ?
you said she played unbelievably well in the tiebreaker . is it difficult to make a point after she brings back a ball with her split ?
what happened at the beginning with the badge ?
who put it on the wrong place ?
was it hard for you to start that late ?
was it getting cold on the court or were the conditions okay ?
did you notice in the second set she apparently had some difficulties with the leg ?
no , kim .
did you see she called the trainer on court ?
what did you think at that moment ?
you lost the first set and then came back to win the match . can you tell us how you went in the first set and then how you got back into the game ?
flavia said she 's beaten you three times and you won one prior to this , and she thought you improved greatly . would you agree with this ? and where have you improved ?
no , overall since your last meeting .
did you feel different going into this match to the match against stosur ?
why do you think you were more nervous today against a lower-ranked player ?
have you had this happen before from a big win going into a next game ...
a slower start in the next game ?
you ca n't explain it ?
you made a lot of mistakes in the first set , and then suddenly something changed . pennetta had the chance to go 2-0 in the second set . do you think that was the key moment , because you were able to escape that situation ?
pennetta in the first set had 76 % of first serve in . in the third set only 43 % , so less than 50 % . did that help you a lot , to find the return , to make points ?
you had two games where pennetta was love-40 , so you had three breakpoints each game . she came back to win each game . were you worried you were n't going to break ?
do you think you are playing better here than in wimbledon ? has something changed , apart from the surface ?
there are not many lefty players on the tour . do you try to use that as an advantage ?
you are a left-handed player . you are no.1 in the world for lefty players .
do you try to use that ?
you 're stroking your hair . is that a nervous thing ?
this is a prior question . how long have you been wearing braces ?
and for how long more ?
how do you think you 'll be feeling going into your next match ?
can you play with a bit more freedom , a bit more relaxed ?
caroline wozniacki play for prostejov .
can you talk about that ? why did you do that ?
you are very young , so you probably do n't know how somebody can feel when they 're 30 years old . francesca schiavone played 4 hours and 44 minutes . she has to play tomorrow wozniacki . do you have the feeling someone who is 30 years old can play another match two days after ?
who do you see favored in that match ? be honest .
tell me the truth . what do you think ?
what will you do over the next day and a half in terms of preparing and relaxing before your next match ?
what did you do yesterday before this match ?
can you shut down your thoughts and not think about tennis ?
how do you do that ? what do you do ?
what are you reading at the moment ?
what did you do in the second set to pull away from your opponent ?
was it hard to play the late match ?
when you called the trainer , what was wrong ?
what was it , antiinflammatories ?
do you feel like you 're playing consistently well enough to win the tournament ?
what is the most exciting thing you 've ever done ? if it 's illegal , we promise not to tell anyone .
exciting .
you went to help it out ? you thought it was dying or something ?
it was a baby ?
scratch you pretty good ?
did you go to the doctor ?
you 've done a lot of boxing . did you think about boxing the kangaroo as it took a swing at you ?
it was n't a park near your hotel in the city ?
want to talk about the match ?
when you 've played in sydney , did you have time to go to the sydney opera house ?
i 'm sure you discussed this before at other times , but can you talk about why you picked tennis over other sports ? obviously you had some other options with your dad and mom .
did you play football ?
you must have been pretty good , given you have the genes and everything .
what other team sports did you play where they left you on the sidelines ?
why do you like liverpool ?
they won 3-nil yesterday .
who out of your possible competitors do you fear the most ?
elena baltacha was in here last week and she said when you 're a lower-ranked player playing a higher-ranked player you can not afford to respect them . you 're the highest ranked player . do you go on the court with respect for your opponent or is that the wrong word to use ?
kim , by her own admission , did n't play terribly well yet she 's still comfortably favorite to win here . do you think that 's right ?
is favored to win here quite comfortably .
should you be favorite ?
can you talk about kuznetsova and schiavone . both grand slam champions , experienced , capable . talk about the two of them , what you think you have to do .
you have a wonderful stadium park in copenhagen where every june they have a grand prix in speedway . did you have a chance to watch it or if not would you love to go for it ?
you 're obviously very young . what have you invested your earnings into ? have you bought any properties yet ?
what is the most expensive thing you 've ever bought for yourself ?
what kind ?
it 's not an audi then ?
i want your opinion on kim clijsters . have you watched her ?
did you feel comfortable out there tonight ?
i just did n't think you were quite there .
even if it was n't a good day at the office are you optimistic that there will be good days very soon ?
could you perhaps talk a little bit about your decision to bring thomas hogstedt in and watch you .
since you have always been a proud player ...
yeah , proud of your story , your being no.1 and all this .
no . i 'm just asking you if you suffer from not being anymore at the top where you were , if it 's really painful , or since you have already reached many , many goals you are anyhow satisfied ?
still , it 's your career ...
today francesca schiavone is going to be no.4 in the world and she 's more than 30 years old , which means you can go out even when you 're much older .
does that send a message for you , says anything to you , or since you got everything when you were 18 it 's enough ?
this is about the quality of game , that we can have a match today of 4 hours and 44 minutes , the longest ...
yeah , longest match of all-time in grand slam history .
two questions : looking back , was it a bit of a risk to take a break from michael before a slam ? two , i know you did not want to talk about the match before , but what did n't you bring to the table tonight that could have been more effective ?
so looking forward , coming out of here , it is a major and i know it 's the beginning of the year , but to achieve your goals this year , what are you going to have to do to get better and compete at the level you 're capable of playing at ?
you seem to love creating little pieces of history . first it was paris , and now tonight . how do you feel about the way things turned out ?
how do you feel now , about an hour and a half afterwards ? total elation , perhaps ?
svetlana said she forgot the score and did n't know who was serving . did you feel like that at times ?
when you hit the net on the breakpoint , did you feel that that was a very important thing ?
but mentally you recovered from that , or did you think that was an important moment that you let slip there ?
how do you feel about being part of history , being in the longest women 's match at the australian open ?
how do you feel to be the no.4 in the world today , top of your career , like only one italian player has been in the past ?
did you notice the crowd out there today during the match ?
yes .
after the match point at wimbledon last year , john isner and nicolas mahut became very , very close friends . they did n't know each other too well , and now they have like a bond , a friendship . you 've known svetlana a long , long time . do you feel particularly close now that you 've had this match ?
how confident that you 'll have energy for another tough match ?
have you ever tried anything like this before ? or remotely close to it ?
were you aware at all as the clock ticked to 4 hours 44 minutes that it was becoming the longest match ?
i think a lot of players who just before they were 30 years old won their first grand slam , they would say , i ca n't do any better than that . that 's about as good as i can do and maybe slow down a bit . you seem to have done the opposite . you 've improved . it 's quite remarkable .
how would you describe your next opponent ?
the match that went 9-7 in the third set a few days ago , did that help you at all out there today ?
the francesca we saw today the same one we saw at roland garros , or is a different one ?
quarterfinals at the australian open . is in the best of your career ?
about tonight 's match , where did you think you beat sharapova ?
were you getting flashbacks to roland garros after you got broken the first time ?
did you talk to your countrywoman julia goerges the other day about how that match went for her ?
could you talk a little bit about your dance ? i know you already talked about the dance on the court , but how did you pick that kind of cool dancing move ?
yeah .
where has your improvement come from over the last year or two ?
this is a very big break for a tournament and obviously for you , and there does n't seem to be a hint nerves in you at all . are you just doing a good job of hiding it , or are you just really enjoying it , opening yourself up and enjoying the whole experience ?
can talk a little bit about 2008 you stepped on court and your knee got torn up . talk about the process of getting back and now your a quarterfinalist here .
could you tell us what you thought of the match and why you won .
what was the difference between you and victoria today ? was it serving ? you served better ?
you were more consistent then ?
what were the conditions like out there , the weather conditions ?
does it worry you , her screeching and grunting ? did that put you off or worry you at all ?
was her game different today ?
what about your play ? you now have a new coach . are you changing your game ?
is your husband a good coach to work with ?
you have a lot of fans here in australia because you 've done so well . do you wish you got a bit more praise in your home country ? do you wish more people took notice of you ?
everyone wants to win a grand slam tournament . is that desire stronger for you because no chinese person has ever won a grand slam tournament ?
i saw the tattoo today .
what is it ?
how old were you when you got that ?
what did you say it was ?
do you ever have any regrets that you separated from the state sport system , or do you feel that allowed you to flourish ?
what are the good things and the bad things ?
in china where does tennis rank in popularity of all sports ?
if you walk down the street in beijing or anywhere , do you get recognized by people ?
can you talk about growing up , i think it was in wuhan , right ?
you seem to be very mentally tough and have a lot of confidence . where does that come from ?
what about your parents , can you talk about what they taught you that helps you play tennis now ?
she still does n't watch you ?
last week you beat kim clijsters in sydney . what can you tell us about kim ?
justine henin opened an academy in beijing . what kind of impact does it have for chinese tennis ?
when will you open your academy ?
did you try to beat the record of mahut and isner ?
what do you remember of the six match points that you had ? did you think some of them you could have made it ?
do you think you could watch the video , 4 hours and 44 minutes ?
is it the most hard match in your career ?
do you remember other matches of yours where you had six match points and you lost ?
you both won roland garros . what about to be strong , so hard rallies , is it possible to say about it a little ?
there was a crucial point where she could have won the point and ran into the net and you won the point . were you confident after that ? that seemed to give you a bit of a roll .
you say the other day that you were going to fight like animals , and you did .
no . did you say anything to francesca at the end or she say something to you or you 're in the talking for a while or going out to dinner ?
what is your balance of the tournament at the end ? you were not playing well last year . today you lost , but you played a great match . the last ten games were fantastic considering the situation , the condition , the shape and everything else .
do you think today you played better or worse than against justine ?
this might make you feel better . you 've earned over 15 million dollars in your career and francesca has earned only 7. have you ever done anything with your 15 million ?
a big second set . how were you playing that second set ?
have you played a tougher tiebreak ?
but you did n't win that tiebreaker against myskina .
now when you 're playing these tiebreakers , you 've had a very good last year . seems like you 're more composed , know what to do to win the points .
as the rounds progress , do you think sweeping out the cobwebs more and more ?
you 've been amazingly consistent at the grand slams in the past year . just want to talk about that , how you 've been able to go round by round , not panic , play the game you want to play .
wozniacki said in her press conference it 's time we all moved on and stopped asking you two whether you deserve your ranking . are you getting tired of those questions , too ?
is it tough playing in the heat ?
outside of mentally , can you just talk about your technical improvement ? seems like you have more options in your game now , too .
can you talk about pavlyuchenkova ?
do you like playing the younger russians ?
disappointed obviously . what 's going through your head ?
5-3 up in the tiebreak , it felt like you had the set then . what was going through your mind at that point ?
with it being as wide open as it appeared to be , what is your sense of disappointment that you 're not into the second week , having a go at your home slam ?
realistically would you be more likely to win one of the other three slams for reasons of surface and less home pressure ?
did you feel more home pressure ?
in reality , that pressure is going to follow you now at every grand slam .
what did dave tell you a couple things to work on or what was the message or game plan ?
she 's obviously on a big roll now . do you think she 's capable of winning the tournament ?
who is your pick now ?
what is your schedule from here on ?
yes .
after fed cup ?
close win against a tough opponent . must be happy with how it went today .
you must take a lot of confidence from that .
the next round , you could play sam stosur .
your record against her is very good . you would have additional confidence going in .
do you think because of those factors that she would be additionally difficult to confront this time around ?
can you put a finger on why your record against her is so good ? something you do well that she finds hard to counter ?
with the fed cup coming up in hobart ...
you 've played kim clijsters during her first and second career . what kind of difference can you see between kim 1 and kim 2 ?
through to the fourth round of a grand slam for the first time . how do you feel ?
why did you win today 's match ? what was the difference between the two of you ?
how difficult was that final game when you were serving and cramping after every point ?
the seventh game of the final game you saved breakpoints seven times . how do you look back at that point ?
your next-round opponent will be a polish opponent agnieszka radwanska . last time you played her you won . how do you rate her ?
what impact has li na 's success had on you ? has it inspired you ? do you look at her and think , i can do that as well ?
you played morita a couple times before . today did you see any difference in her game ? today she played more aggressive and mixed up some different kind of shots .
sam just had a press conference and said the difference between the two of you was that you played the big points better . was it as simple as that ?
what was your game plan ?
how did you handle the center court crowd ? did you enjoy it ?
do you think the crowd can work for you as much as against you ? there 's that much expectation on the hometown player .
australia has been good to you : hobart , brisbane , melbourne . what do you think about that ?
can you win here ? how far can you go ?
you play pennetta next . have you played her before and what are your thoughts on that game ?
pennetta before said she was more afraid of your lefty game than with stosur because she has a better record . she said with you is difficult for her .
she beat you in fed cup , but you were not at your best there .
you won easily in beijing or not against pennetta .
what do you expect when you have to play her ?
are you surprised of the results you had since wimbledon , semifinal there , then all these results , but you 're still behind in the rankings ? your game seems to be much better than 28 .
who is your coach ?
how did you feel you got into the match eventually ? it was difficult to begin with , then did you feel you were getting into it a bit more ?
what is difficult about her ?
was that your toughest match so far ?
in her press conference , she thought you could play a lot better . does that make you feel better ?
the results over the last couple of days , have you afforded yourself the luxury of looking forward as to what the scenarios might be in the second week ?
what happened ?
we saw how debilitating it was two days ago when it happened . how has the last 24 , 48 hours gone for you ? take us through that .
how disappointing is this for you ?
did you get any medical advice that it was n't a good idea to play ?
in between the other day and this match .
just to follow up on what your mom said , i 've seen you over the years and seemed like coming into the tournament you were n't in prime condition and moving that well . did you ever consider taking another month and rehabbing after what you went through in the fall ? do you think you pushed it too much just trying to play here ?
is this an injury that 's likely to stay with you for a long time and set you back from future tournaments as well ?
will you get some scans before you fly home so you know how badly injured you are ?
does it hurt a lot when you 're just walking around the hotel or up and downstairs or anything like that ?
were you kind of hoping for a miracle , that you could get out there and the adrenaline will get going and you would be able to move ? because it was n't just about tonight . did you really think it would heal enough where you could play at a decent level ?
serena tends to be a little more emotional outwardly than you have been . how sad are you ? does it hurt you badly or is it just something where you can say , i 'm a tough woman and i can shake it off and tomorrow is another day ?
you played great at the us open and played some great tournaments last year . a lot of gaps because of injuries .
at what point is tennis just not worth it to you ?
can i ask you your thoughts on the court when you were hitting up obviously and that delay happened and it looked to be a bubble and it was fairly comical . what were your thoughts ?
so it was actually your foot pressure ? you did n't see a ball bounce fair or do anything ...
were you amazed when they did that ball test and it did n't come back at all ?
it did n't disrupt you ?
the match was very tight and entertaining .
what were your thoughts on the game ? how did you view your performance ?
did she surprise you at all ?
looking further into the tournament , is this game today a good one for you ?
outside of the fight , are you happy the way you 're striking the ball ?
so you want to look ahead to either of your next two opponents , venus , who you have n't played in quite a while . i do n't know if you played petkovic . talk about venus .
do you feel you 're fitness is at a point where if you have to play six or seven two-and-a-half-hour matches you can do it ?
i guess too is that the arm is healing good more than just the legs ?
just a question on behalf of new zealand . i know there were a few dramas earlier in the week or funny things . i just wanted you to confirm that there was no problems in new zealand , that you had a good time there , because it 's very important for our tourism . did you have a good time ?
i was trying .
just the talk about stalking and that sort of thing .
so new zealand was a great experience ?
helicopter maybe .
are you ready for the next round against justine or svetlana ?
what can you tell us about justine ?
no , she 's not .
can you tell us a few words about kim clijsters .
just in general , what can you tell us about her comeback ?
did things change in italy after winning the french open ? did you receive more invitations for tv shows , for example ?
yeah , i did .
what is the craziest invitation you received ?
you have been to belgium twice last year .
to play exhibition games .
what were your impressions of belgium ? what did you do ?
the first time you did n't play . you were just standing , i think . the second time you played . was it a bit of a compensation for the first one ?
did you advise serena not to play there ?
but you spoke to her in brussels ?
have you ever had such an exhibition in italy since you 're famous now ?
do you feel like you got stood up at a really good restaurant tonight ?
do you feel there should be a rule , maybe a medical certificate for people that are injured to be able to play ?
is it different mentally to prepare for a match like that against a champion like venus knowing she 's not going to be 100 % ?
that 's back-to-back fourth rounds now at grand slams . must be some satisfaction for you personally ?
i did n't see you play earlier in the year . you 're doing better now .
a semifinalist last year . are you playing better now than this time last year ?
what was good about your match today ?
what did you like about your match today ?
what were the conditions like ?
what has changed on your team ?
that 's it ?
what is that like , having your husband as your coach ? how is that different ?
was that decision entirely yours and his or was the federation having a say in that ?
you say he 's the boss on the court . are you the boss off the court ?
what do you think it would mean for tennis in china if you were to win a grand slam like here ?
if you won this tournament , what would happen to the game in china ? do you think it would become much bigger ?
what if china had a grand slam event ?
getting back to today 's match , your opponent , did she have problems with the hot weather , did you notice ?
did you notice ?
this surface suits you , though ?
was beating kim clijsters in sydney important ?
you played azarenka before . you 're likely to play her in the next round .
she 's just about to , i think .
have you played her before ?
have you beaten her ?
can you explain why chinese women have done well but the chinese men have done not so well ? what is the reason for that ?
is the shanghai event making much of a difference in china to making the game bigger ?
we 'll have to make you an australian because you play so well out here all the time . why is it you play well in australia ? is it the conditions ?
you obviously won in sydney last week , gold coast a couple years ago , melbourne the semifinals , so you obviously enjoy playing .
justine has dominated past matches . what was the difference today ?
quite hard work in the end for you . justine said she sensed the nerves in you . did you tighten up in the second set ?
in that period you started to try and play safe and that almost compounded the problem for you .
is it because it was justine do you think ?
also you want somebody who plays better when you 're back sometimes , that you take more risk like justine did .
do you have a cold or something ?
francesca just mentioned before that this year in her opinion you move better . is that because you lost some weight ?
francesca say that you move better this year and you 're more quick in a way ?
she looks your matches .
you lose weight ?
how is your foot ?
and can i ask you something about you and francesa ? you 're friends outside of court . she always says nice things about you and you about her .
in the past .
we 're waiting for it ?
who 's going to bite the other one first ?
you played so many times justine . she has made some mistakes today . do you think she was at her best level ?
so you think you 're not 100 % of your shape ?
what is missing ?
how important was your win over sam stosur in sydney last week ? i think it was your first win against a top 10 opponent in quite some time .
do you remember anything in particular of your previous matches with francesca schiavone ?
and about tennis-wise , matches , head to head ...
in the tiebreak , what made the decision , turning point ?
can i have a few words about another belgian player , kim clijsters . you played her in the first career , and in the second career .
last year i think . you played once against her .
a bit of a disappointing result . what was the difference between the two of you ?
you dominated her in the past . does that make it even more disappointing ? did you think you had her ?
did you sense a vulnerability in her ? she was serving for the match twice and then it goes to tiebreak . there were several match points there as well .
you double faulted nine times . what was that about ? was your arm troubling you again today ?
now that you look at the rest of the draw , in reference especially to sam stosur and kim , who do you like for the title next weekend ?
you said there are no excuses . fully understood , but you were wearing a strapping on the elbow . it 's not a big question for us .
been six months since you injured the elbow . are you surprised it 's taken so long to get it right again ?
so if this was n't a grand slam , would you have delayed your comeback a bit longer ?
a slow start , but then you got it all together . what are your thoughts on the match ?
she was hitting the ball so cleanly in the first set . was it a matter of hanging on and waiting till she started missing a few of those ?
did you sense a change come over her when she started missing a few ?
is your game at a level you 'd like it to be at this stage of the championship ?
you had a problem with your racquets today or the string ?
you told the crowd you thought that was probably the best tennis you played this summer . how does that rate ?
what does it feel like to be in that kind of zone where just about everything you try works ?
sounds like you have your next opponent a bit better pegged this time around than last time you played her .
have you watched her much ?
what are the threats you see from her ?
do you feel like you 're building some good momentum now ?
you spoke on court about those months of being out with the fairies . what do you do to recover that concentration ?
it 's different this year from your success last year where every round the screws get turned tighter . have you thought about talking to someone maybe like andy murray with the pressure he gets at wimbledon or andy roddick at the us open or mauresmo at the french open ? do you see that as something you need to do ?
are you ever conscious of this is probably the peak period of your career , being fully appreciating it , saying that you enjoyed it at the time ?
it 's been a long time since an australian woman won a grand slam . is that something that you think about or try to keep out of your mind ?
can you talk us through what went wrong for you today .
if it was unforced errors and things like that , you 're not disappointed in the structure of your game , just the execution ?
what can you take out of this tournament ?
an extension of that is confidence . do you think with confidence slowly the game will click together ?
what sort of priority is tennis going to continue to be for you in 2011 ?
how much do you plan to play ? where are you going to settle after you get married ?
where do you plan to be based ?
will you be watching sam tonight ?
on paper she should get past tonight . do you think she might be there come the weekend next weekend ?
you seem really composed . can you say what sort of role what 's happening with tim and what 's happening off the court has played in how you want to attach your tennis now ? has it given you sort of a new release a little bit too ?
did your performance here over both matches change anything with a view to your future , coming into the tournament , having played it , in terms of how long you might continue or even what tournaments you might target this year ? have you changed anything as a result of your play here ?
the four slams and future fed cup ties this year ?
will you play qualifying in the grand slams if you had to ?
will we still see you playing as alicia molik ?
after a good start , it developed into a fight . how did it get away from you in the end ?
you had a difficult second half to last season ; this season is a slow start . how discouraging is that ?
is it a matter of fitness when you say you 're missing shots you should have made ?
you 've played her seven times with six wins . have you seen any notable improvement in her today ?
serbian and croatian fans were prevented from taking their national flags into hisense arena last night . how does that make you feel ?
is it important for you to see a serbian flag flying in the crowd ?
could you make a comment about the chinese player and her performance today ?
do you think peng can be a better player with a higher ranking compared with her 50 ranking ?
but are you surprised at all with the level she showed today with some really good tennis ?
you mentioned some injuries last year . are you worried that you wo n't be able to regain the game that you had in 2007/2008 ?
another impressive win .
so there 's some improvement left in your game ?
i think you 've won 18 of your last 20 matches from the beginning of the us open to here . talk about how you feel about your game , what you feel you 've been doing correctly , all that .
that 's a pretty big change from the start of your career when you were working the points more rather than just trying to jump on your opponents .
dreaded third round next up . do you think of that match against nadia on hisense last year ?
talk us through the evonne goolagong cawley thing . you said it 's a replica of what she wore at wimbledon .
was that one of the more bizarre on-court interviews you 've gone through in your career ?
how did you find out about the text ?
any texts from rennae since then ?
i guess you do n't want to have a second comeback with a second baby ?
was that a no.1 seed performance today ?
what did you like most about the match ?
how much improvement is there ? still got another five matches to go before the final .
were you comfortable coming into the tournament , given you had the couple exhibition losses and then cibulkova ?
did you get enough of a break during the off-season and did you actually feel mentally refreshed starting the new year ?
talking about cibulkova , you 're going to face her again in the third round .
a few words about kim ? what do you think about her for the moment ?
do you have higher expectations for yourself now than you did at this time last year ?
percentage-wise , how much better do you think you can get in the next couple years ?
would you consider yourself a perfectionist at all ?
do you get upset with yourself when you 're not performing at the level you know you can ?
in the off-season you played an exhibition in minsk with azarenka . you found yourself hitting with the president . was that spontaneous or planned ?
would you rather be a younger player who is still coming up and people do n't know as well , or would you rather be in this position at no.1 where the pressure is obviously going to be greater ?
you 're playing with a new racquet . what are you stringing it with ?
which was what ? some kind of composite ?
what was the injury today ?
your thigh or hip or stomach or ...
what does that mean ?
so you 're not saying .
how pleased were you to be able to come through and how do you think you 'll be able to carry on to the championship ?
did you consider not going on today ?
it 's not the first time you 've gotten hurt in matches and continued on . can you compare this experience to some of the other ones ?
even worse than when you played kim and you had a stomach muscle tear ?
do you remember screaming out after you got injured ? it was kind of hard to tell whether that was just a scream of pain or a combination of a grunt and ...
what does the injury do ? how does it inhibit your play ?
is it in the abdomen or is it in the top of the leg ? whereabouts is that ?
i do n't have a medical degree .
after your break , you came on the court and had a look on your face . what was going through your mind when you walked out there ?
do you think that if this was n't a grand slam and as you said on the court afterwards you 're long way from home , it 's a long way to come here and play , that perhaps you might not have carried on ? because it is slam you really feel as though you want to give it as good a shot as you possibly can ?
we could n't find one . when did you last retire from a match ?
so on tour at some point ?
is that a badge of honor for you as well , that you do n't stop , you carry on going regardless .
do you have any sense of why this happened ? obviously you had some tough injuries at the end of the year last year . was it lack of preparation or one of those things ?
are you worried it 's going to affect the rest of the season ?
have you ever gotten mentally tired of dealing with the injuries ? it 's not like this is the first one you 've had .
so this fall , for example , there was n't any time where you said , i 'm just so sick of having to rehab ?
what keeps you going ? there 's got to be some goals .
caroline wozniacki joined you in the wta player council .
tell me about your thoughts of having her on the team ?
any specific things you 're going to talk about in the future ?
could you talk us through your outfit tonight ?
you have as much input into that as your other dresses ?
as the match went on you started to run and looked better once you came back . were you in less pain or just had more confidence down the stretch ?
slow start . looked like a tough match today .
how would you assess it ?
in hindsight , was it a match you needed ?
how long did it take for you to figure out her patterns ?
seemed pretty relaxed . are you enjoying just being able to get about your busy and not worrying about caroline being no.1 or kim being the favorite ? can you just forget about it and just play tennis ?
with things happening off court , is there a certain freedom on court that you have n't experienced before , freedom of not having to wait , always be that person that 's at the pointy end of the field ? you can adjust get about doing your trade ?
your return games were pretty good , but the serve games you 're still struggling . i 'm guessing it 's going to be important for to you hold more frequently .
so how well do you know goerges ? does n't she wear your collection ?
do you have any control over what she wears ?
a big improvement on your first-round match . you looked good tonight . how did you feel about your game ?
is there more improvement there ? can you improve your game as the tournament goes on ?
how far do you look into the draw to see your opponents coming up ? one game at a time , or look a bit further and think , well , the run here is pretty good ?
being seeded 23 , is it something that you think of ? is it a weight to carry around , or do you just go out and play ?
you 're so used to being at the top . the lower ranking , does n't feel any different ?
you said in sydney already that you had taken some time off . what did you do during your holidays ? what did you do in order to make your head fresh again ?
it was your first holiday in 10 years .
if you compare this to what justine did , it 's quite normal that she had to take some time off , too .
you were injured last year ? you had a middle ear infection i read .
there was no problem with your middle ear ? i read that , as well .
your next match seems kind of a strange matchup for a third round .
yes .
you have i think two victories out of 18 against her .
is it special to play a match at 11:00 in the morning ? do you have to change your habits , your routine before the match ?
do you get up earlier before a morning match ?
at what time ?
you used to get along very well with kim clijsters . i do n't know whether it 's still the case . with justine , what is the difference ?
what do you think about kim for the moment ?
disappointing .
do you feel that you 'd had a good chance if you managed to hold on that last game in the second set and take it into a tiebreak ?
is it difficult playing in that twilight with the lights on ?
regardless , you must feel it 's been a really good tournament for you . four wins and getting close tonight .
did you get the sense that she was hindered by that ankle before or afterwards ?
you mentioned later in the second set you felt was a turning point to you . did you think a turning point for her was when she broke back at the start of that set , that shot you put in the net at 1-love ?
when you play , win a good first set like that , and your opponent is struggling a bit , do you almost now assume they 're going to go off for a toilet break ?
does n't both you either way ?
did the thought occur to you that you might be playing venus in the next match ?
going forward , i think you said in your press conference the other day that you were going to be back in the top 100 from next week . you said before that you do n't really play in challenger events . does that mean you 'll still be qualifying for wtas ?
yes .
was that a better match for you today ?
was your serve a key today ?
you talked the other day about how your elbow needs a lot of time to warm up these days . cold weather , first match , yet you started very well .
you said you needed matches to get your rhythm . did that game today provide that ?
you 're no.2 on the bidding to win the title . are you a good bet ?
do you feel like you 're well placed in this tournament to win ?
do you notice ranking and seeding next to your name or do you just play , a double-figure ranking ?
did you come to australia with as many clothes as you 've ever brought before ? do you think the weather will have any effect on the draw , matches in a colder climate ?
you play kuznetsova in the third round . your thoughts on that .
that tiebreaker was obviously very important . after that it all fell out pretty quickly .
did you feel like you had a good chance up until that point ? she showed a few signs of getting angry as well . looked like perhaps if you got just a little bit of a lead you might have been able to crack her .
was the first set frustrating ? any time you hit a good shot she seemed to get a racquet on a lot of stuff out there ?
so if you had match practice ?
maybe some times you looked like you were n't as aggressive as the first match where you set up points well .
so maybe felt a little bit lost until the second set as well . still trying to get it to come together ?
still a little bit up in the air with the coaching situation . where do you feel you can take the rest of year ?
on your schedule , do you have it mapped out , your immediate schedule ?
you have a feeling about what you want to achieve in your career ? any rankings goals ?
how do you feel after that ?
( question regarding respect . )
do you find going into the match like that , you have an 11 seed , someone who won 12 majors , you could be feeling a little hard done by ?
you 've obviously seen and read the henin backhand . when you 're actually out there playing it , how good is it ?
when you 're serving against her , do you have to pick in your mind perhaps the best place to place it ?
3-all in the second set , and you mentioned you got the fist pumps going ; you were up at the net . is it a delicate balance trying to show you 're up for it ? she came out and aced the game and won the next game quite easily .
you mentioned justine 's forehand and backhand . she had seven aces . is her serve so difficult to read ?
every time you leave a grand slam you want to take positives away from it . what would be the positives from the experience this year ?
must be pleased with the way you played today ?
how many games do you think you 'll need to get under your belt before you hit your form ?
does that always make this part of the tournament a very dangerous time because you 're not at full form ?
having made the finals of wimbledon , the us open , do you think that 's made you better prepared to take that extra step perhaps here ?
must make you more confident as a player reaching two finals .
there 's been a lot of talk about you and caroline being 1 and 2 without having won a grand slam . how does that affect you ?
what is more important , reaching no.1 or winning a grand slam ?
is there anything about this tournament in particular that might suit you and help your chances that maybe was n't at wimbledon or the us ?
your season last year was outstanding . what do you feel , looking back now , was the biggest part of your game that improved over that period ?
how close to the perfect performance was that for you today ?
what was the idea you wanted to do today , the one or two things you wanted to get right today ?
how do you think she handled it ? she said she felt overwhelmed . did that come across ?
were you able to get any sort of confidence out rallying with rafa the other day ? you probably do n't get the chance to hit with him too often .
have you ever towered over an opponent like that ?
you said to yourself , you 've got to go in for the kill , not hold back ?
when you win that convincingly , is it almost hard to gauge how well you played ? is there any sort of sense of because maybe the opposition was n't great , it 's hard to judge ?
your next opponent , are you excited ?
you go around the world , but you always look forward to playing this one .
does it help you ?
did you have a giggle when you heard the guys in the crowd repeatedly singing songs based on you ?
are you doing anything differently in terms of more or less people in your entourage this time , same hotel , different restaurant ? have you changed anything superstitious or otherwise ?
do you have a preference for day or night game next match ?
i think you play dushevina or camerin . how does your game stack up against those guys ?
did dave have much to say to you after the match today ?
obviously a pretty tough night .
how do you explain it ? she 's obviously in good form , but yourself ?
have you ever had that feeling before ?
what does that tell you about where you 're at , your motivation ?
what about the emotion of the night ? what has the night been like for the last hour ?
what were you telling yourself emotionally during the breaks ?
does it hurt your pride more than anything else ?
are your physical problems solved ?
so it 's just mental probably ?
once sharapova lost 6-love , 6-love to davenport in california . that did n't mean she could n't play after .
what does your coach say ?
do you have any memory of when you played well when you go out on court ?
do you feel in practice you 're hitting the ball as hard and with as much depth as you used to ?
given the results as they stand , does it make you question your future in the game at all ?
do you regret the split-up with your former coach ? new one , you did n't really make a big result .
are you confident you can get back amongst the best players ?
does n't sound like you 're enjoying yourself now . you always said that is important .
how did you fight your way out of that one ?
is there a certain liberation in being able to swing for the lines and see what happens ?
how do you change that to try to get it in the first half dozen games ?
you 've done the wild card thing , you 've done the playoff , you 've done the country stuff , how rewarding for you .
no distraction having the match moved ?
similar preparation , late-night commentary before the games ?
you played so many years , how much of today was drawing on your experience ?
no thoughts this is going to be your last appearance here , especially given that performance ?
what you said about thinking back to other big matches . did the venus williams come into your mind ?
how can you explain a 6-love first set and a 7-6 second set ?
so it was a good match for you to progress your level up from then ?
physically are you okay ?
you play a fighter next from china . you 've played her before .
wozniacki has the no.1 ranking but has n't won a grand slam . i think you had a similar situation in 2008. does that add pressure ?
what preparation do you have for a big event like a grand slam ?
how do you feel now ? do you think you need more matches before the grand slam ?
can you talk more about your next opponent . you lost to her in 2009 in beijing . what would you expect from her in the second round ? do you think she 's going to surprise you ?
i think so .
as a top player coming into this tournament , do you think you are a contender in this championship this year ?
you looked extremely fit on the court . is your physical shape better than it 's been for a long time ?
is there extra excitement , the fact that it 's wide open , the women 's draw ?
is there anything different about kudryavtseva compared to other players who are at her level of ranking ?
it looked like you had some problems with easy points , not with the hard ones .
were you disappointed with any part of your game ?
why is there a lack of fitness ? lack of match practice more than fitness ?
you 're saying your legs were n't there at the end ?
do you feel you can push your way back up to the top of the rankings ?
that last point of the second set , the easy smash into the net , it cost you the set . how do you get that out of your mind ?
do you feel kind of mental pressure going back to the top 10 ?
but did you feel mental pressure when you were no.1 in the world ?
is your stomach okay now and are you going to be able to do the hard work ?
when you came off court , were you thinking , bad luck , i was in good form , started the year well , got the injury . had it not happened , maybe i 'd be walking out of australia next week rather than today ?
you played some wonderful defense . you stood off six match points . how do you feel about that ?
she looks better than her ranking , too . assess her game a little bit .
she made you chase a lot of balls . she got a lot of balls back in return . were there times when you thought you had a winner and you had to hit an extra shot ?
if you had to pick two players who could win the tournament , who would they be ?
venus ?
not justine ?
what do you think of caroline wozniacki ?
especially in the third set you had a lot of crowd support behind you . how do you feed off that energy in the stadium ?
you served second in the last set . time after time you had to hold your serve to stay in the match . is it fair to say 12 months ago the set would n't have lasted that long ? do you have more confidence this time this year compared to last year ?
are you definitely playing fed cup this year or one tie at a time ?
because of the abdominal ?
you won six times 6-love , 6-love at grand slam tournaments in the past . what does it take to go through consistently from the first point to the last point of the match ?
do you feel it 's a little bit sad she 's struggling so much ?
was it last year that petrova did a similar thing to you ? do you have empathy for her ?
how did you recover from it 12 months ago ?
regardless of the opponent , is that as close to being in the zone as you 've been for a little while ?
in that situation , 6-love , 5-love up , do you think maybe you should give her a game ?
do you have the same feeling in the first set in the sydney finals against na li when you led 5-0 ?
given the success you had in new york , are you a little surprised you have n't been able to win here ?
do you feel you 're a better player than the one who lost to justine in 2004 now ?
seeded no.1 on center court ; a good win to start with . what is your assessment ?
match must have given you a lot of confidence then .
how were the conditions out there ?
they called you sweet caroline in the newspaper the other day . do you know that song ? are you familiar with it ?
are you familiar with the works of neil diamond , the singer ?
as your ring tone ?
how does it feel to play a competitive match after so long ?
what pleased you most about today 's game , your game ?
what 's it like without serena ? do you feel a bit lost ?
a lot of people are talking it might open it up a bit more . is that your feeling , as well ? improved your chances not having your sister here ?
sara is small and does n't have your serve , but what do you think about her game ? do you think she was competing well enough ?
what interesting things have you been getting up to in the last few months ?
school was to study what ?
who has changed more hairstyles between you and your sister , colors and things like that ?
i ca n't .
just on your outfit today , is that one of your designs ? can you tell us a little bit about that ?
why was that ?
how did the book that was published with you come out ?
obviously very happy with that outcome .
how do you feel about that today ?
with more matches , where will the improvement come from as the tournament progresses ? where do you expect the improvement to come from ?
you looked a little nervous in the first game . what happened ?
when did you actually forget about it ? when did you start playing and getting the kirilenko match out of your head ?
can you talk a little bit about the approach to your second serve this year . you 're still trying to hit it fairly big , but you 're also taking a bit of a risk with doubles . do you feel eventually that is going to come around to where you can actually hit it big enough and make it somewhat of a weapon ?
you 're saying you do n't feel the spin ? why ? you do n't have feeling in your arm or hand like before ?
your return from your best , maria , how is that progressing ? is that progressing as you would like or hope ?
yes .
return to the game .
is it any element of frustration having to take it step by step rather than seeing it come very quickly ?
what would you be if you were n't a tennis player ?
have you studied at school those skills ?
do you want to talk about michael not being here ? must have been a big step for both of you .
is it over or is it just a break ?
is it awkward with the two of them trying to have input at the same time ?
you called me a stalker the other day .
have you had a problem with a stalker before ?
the first set was 6-1 , the second 7-5 , which you had to come from behind . what was the difference between the two sets ?
and you 'll recover in time for your next match , no doubt ?
what did winning in sydney do for your confidence ?
how satisfying , given everything , the conditions , the opponent , is that win today ?
different emotions here compared to your last slam where everything went belly up , and now you 're hitting the ball so well , you look confident , and you 're playing confidently .
what won the argument about playing or not playing ? what was the key element ?
what difference has jeremy made ?
there 's a sense almost that you 're striking the ball as consistently well as you have done . do you get that sense as well ?
really ?
do you feel you 're getting back to where you were when you were ranked about the 50 mark ?
when you were feeling a bit down in the dumps after new york , what did you kind of assess your other options to be ?
did you maybe not appreciate everything you had ?
were you aware that bally was on the next court ?
good you both got through .
were you aware she 'd won ?
the girl you played tonight , the challenge of playing someone with her temperament , how does it compare to her popular sister ?
she had a go at one of the ball girls .
looking ahead to your next match , you played petkovic in austria last year . she beat you . do you feel you 've moved on a fair bit since then , though ?
sania started off extremely well this evening . did that take you by surprise ? having done that , how pleased were you at your recovery ?
so you can take a tremendous amount of satisfaction from the way you responded ?
can you say in percentage terms how close you are to form and fitness at the moment ?
do n't you think you 've had so much experience that if you play a couple matches you might be able to play your way into the tournament ?
do you know much about your next opponent from britain ?
you mentioned previously that you need to warm your elbow up before you can play properly . i 'm just wondering , how do you feel after the match ? is there much pain there ? how do you pull up the next day ?
before you retired , your serve was very good , very consistent , pretty strong . then when you came back , you and carlos decided to change a couple things maybe to add a little more speed . do you feel that was the right decision ? why do you think you really needed to change a stroke that was working so well ?
elena baltacha has been through an awful lot in her life , a lot of serious illnesses , difficult injuries , and at 27 is still out there battling . not exactly the same way , but like you she finds sport as a reassurance for her to keep going . can you see in a sense a similarity there where you 've acquired sport to keep your perspective on life ?
do you sympathize at all with wozniacki and maybe safina coming to the no.1 ranking without a grand slam and all the questions that they face ?
must feel pretty good . looked pretty happy after that match there .
you said last year you came into this tournament a bit flat and tired , emotionally spent . how different is it this year ?
do you feel significantly better than you did this time last year ?
can you say what 's happened with the coach ? there 's some suggestion you split .
have you made any decisions on who you might lean on for this tournament ?
tough to make a decision so close to a major with so much on the line ?
you played more aggressively , swinging for the lines .
tell us about the expectation of last year , center court , 500 ranking points , compared to nothing to lose as today .
did you feel it was a bit of a release , not playing under glen 's style and playing to what you felt was more natural ?
how much more do you think you can achieve ?
do you feel you still have a lot of tennis left in you ?
you talked about this year being a good year . what is a good year by your standards ?
what about the next two weeks ?
you like a good fight then ?
what was the issue with your leg ?
when you have an opponent that you think is going to blow out but does n't , is it more of a mental battle ?
were the double-faults almost surreal ?
that was the only smile she gave you the entire match .
does that bring out the best in you , maybe a dogfight and a real strong battle ?
was that the idea , that you might play justine , in your head during the match ?
if it is going to be justine , do you think you 've got a chance there ?
she 's been saying over the last couple weeks she wo n't be back to the top of her game until maybe the summer . is that herself talking down her chances , do you think ?
does what she says encourage you ?
can you remember playing in conditions like that before here ? plenty of times back home , but not here .
is it at all difficult as you get better and better and your ranking goes up , you do have these matches where you 're almost expected to win , you go into one like on wednesday where , as you said , the pressure is not on you , is that back and forth difficult or ...
what game plan would you have against justine ?
what did you learn from the third round last year ? can you take anything from that to use this year ?
you say the girl today did n't give any respect . will you give henin respect ?
talking about respect , did you get the idea the ball flew towards you from her end and hit the backcourt ? did you think , no respect ?
you 're one of the first players in a long time to crack 10,000 points in the wta world rankings . how do you see yourself in comparison to some of the people that have been there before you ?
i 'm sure you 're very excited and happy , as you said , about this . what does a title like this mean to you ?
any thoughts on this trophy ?
can you kind of describe the flow of the match ? you seemed like you really had it there at the beginning . she fought back in that second set .
did you expect her level to drop in the third set ? did you say , at the changeover , okay , she played great in that second set , but she 's not going to be able to keep that level up ?
it seemed like maybe i 'm wrong that you were actually a little nervous closing the match out , you were kind of moving your feet a lot . is that true ? just talk about the feelings .
what did your dad say to you when you were talking to him on court ?
she said at the end she got exhausted and tired . once again , you did not . you know , it 's pretty amazing week after week as much as you play you do n't even get tired within matches . can you just talk about your conditioning and how much that helps you .
how do you rank this victory ? you won the wimbledon juniors when you were 16. how does this feel to you ?
when you can see her visibly tired , leaning up against the wall , breathing heavy , does that give you a lift at all ?
do you ever get mentally tired ? the fact that you 've played a lot of the last couple years , did n't have that much time coming into this year , and , again consistently deep in every single tournament , seems like you 're fresh . how do you do that ?
do you get easily distracted by the crowd , or can you just block that out ?
how are you going to celebrate ?
lots of fun . you liked hingis growing up a bit , right ?
do you remember watching her play when she was winning her slams and how she played ? because there are some similarities i think between your two games . just talk about her a little bit .
so it 's rare that players go back to back at indian wells and miami , but since you 're always fresh , i guess you 're giving yourself a chance at that .
are you going straight to miami or are you going to monaco ?
we really appreciate the way you play , and we wonder why , when you get your opponent off the court why you do n't come to the net more .
i mean when you have her off balance , when her legs are crossed and she only has a defensive shot back . we were just wondering why . but you win most of your points by outlasting your opponent obviously .
what happened in that first set ? then you had to regroup to come back . was were any nerves in the beginning ?
you will be back in the top 10. that must give you a lot of satisfaction .
do you feel like it 's only time until caroline wins a grand slam title ?
what was the most difficult thing in today 's match for you ?
what do you think it takes to beat her ? what sort of tactics did you come into the game playing ?
are your emotions at the moment a little bit mixed , in that sad that you did n't win the title , but at the same time , as you just said , the positives that you take out and pride in what you 've achieved at this tournament .
your thoughts on the performance here at indian wells and your thoughts on this tournament and if it means anything to you to achieve the final here ?
you made the semis here and had a really good week . what are your thoughts about how you did this week ?
what were you pleased about with your game throughout the week ?
what was tough against marion today ?
could you tell me a little bit about why you could n't get into the match ?
it 's just one of those days ?
that was a good win . how is your stomach issue today ? you were n't feeling too good in the previous round .
i suppose you 'll be watching the game tonight . which one of the two opponents would you rather see in the final , and why ?
you 've been on tour for a few years . you 've been a wimbledon finalist . does a result like this excite you ? does it thrill you ? what kind of emotions do you feel ?
what happened against caroline a couple weeks ago ? that is n't a normal type of defeat for you . you only won a couple of games . you could n't find a way to put the ball past her .
what was the most satisfying area of your game today , even though you were n't feeling at your best ?
if you happen to be playing sharapova , what are your thoughts on that one ?
you told the french press or in french yesterday that you have a 175 iq .
that 's very high .
how do you know that ?
so for someone with 175 iq , choosing tennis over math or painting .
with the amount of money you 've made , i would not say that . but it 's different , though .
you 're very mathematical , correct ?
so do you bring that in tennis ? do you see tennis mathematically on the court ?
but thinking a lot also can be detrimental on the court .
but you also have your artistic side , right ? you 're a painter ?
you do everything . you have the math side . you 're into both sides of the brain .
are you more of a mathematician or more of an artist on the court ?
this is your father who is a chess player speaking ?
as an artist , what trend do you prefer ? more on the abstract or ...
impressionists ?
on behalf of japanese tennis fans , i 'd really like to say thank you for what you did . i know you already talk about how you guys came up with idea on the court , but could you again explain about the flag ?
when did you write it down ? last night ?
two hours away you had to go ? where did you have to go ?
have you heard any feedback at all yet from japan about this , any communication about what the gesture was like ?
you must have very bittersweet feelings about how you got through .
can you talk about your match against maria at the us open ? it was obviously a big one . she was a three-time grand slam champion . i 'm sure you 're going to say there was no pressure on you , but obviously it was important to the both of you , and you came through very well .
can you talk about -- before you first played her , let 's say a few years ago , you were coming up as a junior and she was winning grand slams -- what your impression of her was a player and to a degree as a person ?
did you talk to victoria after the match yet ? have you had a chance to ask her what happened ?
in your game obviously you 're playing great defensive tennis , keeping the ball in play , playing long rallies . what are you trying to do just to develop weapons in your serve or forehand ? what are you working on ?
as no.1 in the world , along with that probably comes a certain sense of responsibility . how do you see your role at the top of the rankings at the moment with reaching out like you did today ?
kleybanova told me the other day that she thinks there are a lot of people on tour now , before they go on court against you because you 've become so consistent , they already feel like they 've lost because they know they have to play for hours and hours just to get the victory . do you feel that at all ? are you aware of that ?
do you remember the last time you got tired running , where you felt like , this match has been going on a long time and i 'm sick of running back and forth ? really physically tired . it had to have happened sometime .
if it 's not maria and it 's peng shuai , what do you know about her and her game ?
do you feel like you 're playing for poland as well as your country at all ? i mean , do you feel like you 're representing poland ever ? because you obviously have a big connection .
happy after that ? satisfied ? content ? just okay ?
that 's called experience , is n't it ? match experience ?
when you are going through a rough patch with considerable errors what kinds of things can you do to get yourself refocused ? what are you telling yourself during those times ?
when you called for your coach , is that partly to slow that momentum and maybe disrupt her game a bit to give yourself a breather ?
have you had a chance to kind of step back and take an overview of this and the opportunities ? i mean , serena , she 's ill and all , but she 's not there anymore . venus is not there anymore . clijsters gets hurt . i think you 're back in the top 10 with this victory , i think .
this is an opportunity . you 're only 23 years old , and there are plenty of grand slams out there . you seem to be healing . is this kind of like the time ? do you feel that ? have you thought about that ? any strategy ?
what do you expect out of yourself at this point ? is it match to match , or are you looking kind of big picture ?
could you take a moment and try and put into words the feeling you get at that moment of triumph when you know you 've won a really big tournament , wimbledon , the u.s. , australia , that sort of ecstacy ? what floods through you at that moment ? can you try and put that into words ?
can you talk a little bit about caroline ? she seems to be getting better by the month . extremely consistent .
invites unforced errors from other opponents . she 's had a few problems in the slams against the more experienced players , but for the most part , she 's every single week going deep .
us open ? i know you do n't like to look back too much , but for you is that just more of a lack of execution than anything else ?
how 's the new coaching arrangement going ? how would you describe his voice ? any comparison to michael 's ? how is he different ?
is he more x and is os , or is he more sort of emotion , feeling ?
yeah , like strategy .
when you arrive at one tournament to the next , just before things start , do you have the same sort of feeling mentally and all that , one tournament to the next ? or do you feel that , oh , god , here i can do really well ; i think this could be a good week for me ? or this is not really working out the way i wanted to ? how do you feel from one tournament to the next ?
coming into here , how did you feel ?
we of course are here in california . glamour , cutting age , diversity . in what ways do you see yourself as a californian ?
can you talk about your support of the survivors of chernobyl and what that brings up with you regarding the survivors of japan . knowing your support for the survivors back in chernobyl , what does that bring up for you as you 're reading the news and about what 's happening in japan ?
you have had a good year so far . this tournament now . are you pleased ? is it part of how your season has been going so far , winning a lot of matches ?
what you think was the turning point in that match ? when did she sort of take over from you ?
why could n't you see her serve ? i did n't understand .
in the third set , in the sixth game when she held serve to make it 3-3 and then she started to play better after that , what happened ?
but that 's the point you remember , 3-2 and 40-15 ? that 's what you keep going back to , is n't it ?
she had 13 double faults . did you sense her getting frustrated ? did you also feel like that was an opportunity for you to take advantage of ?
i think you had four .
it was a very big celebration for a quarterfinal win . was that because you were n't feeling well ?
so you have a flu ? is that what you have ? or a virus ? something that 's giving you fever ?
how did you get that much energy in the second set ? you were running a lot for somebody who was sick .
could you feel she was gathering a lot of momentum near the end of the second set so you really had to shut it out ?
did you feel a little bit her quality was improving as the match went on , or was that not something you sensed ?
there are many players out on the tour who have very classic strokes . you obviously have different hitches and grips and so forth .
in any case ...
no , i 'm not . but my question is : do you think your difference on your strokes and your serve , do you think that helps you in some way against opponents or not ?
in between the points you take a lot of practice swings and service motions . is that just a mental game to psych yourself up for the next point ?
i think this is your seventh tournament just to start the year . do you ever get tired of the travel , just the week-to-week grind ?
not at all ? not even a little bit ?
so you are not lying on the couch watching the australian open saying , oh , this is nice ? i do n't have to get up today ?
having not played your best tennis yesterday against kim , how concerned were you coming into today 's match ?
if you win your next game and caroline wozniacki keeps her seed , then there 's a good opportunity for you to make it further than you have at indian wells . what is your opportunity of the remaining competition at the tournament ?
you have been the top french player more or less since pierce and mauresmo went away . does that matter to you ?
that was kind of tough match . do you think you started a little bit slow , or she did play really well ?
heat bother you at all ? it was pretty hot .
and i like your outfit . the blue one .
any concept or story behind that ?
what did your father say when he came ?
he was very intense , moving his hands , talking loudly . do you get everything he says ? are you listening or trying to concentrate at the same time ?
can you give us your thoughts about kim ? she had to pull out of her match because of her shoulder . can you give us your thoughts about that ? i do n't know if you follow it that much , but that kind of solidifies your no.1 ranking for a little bit longer .
are you aware that of the seeds , it 's you and no.8 is all that 's left now ? are you aware of that , or do you like that or does it matter ?
you are always very successful in japan , especially from this year . you started using japanese racquet . so as the no.1 player , do you have any like plans to something for japanese tsunami victims ?
can you talk about when you first met victoria , when you first became friends , and then just kind of take us through the rivalry up to now and the friendship ?
wow .
so you became friends when you were in the juniors or not until the pros ?
and i know this is talked about a lot , the players will say well , i can put the rivalry aside , but you two have played pretty close , had close matches . she 's in the top 10 ; obviously you 're no.1 . does it affect the friendship whatsoever , or do you ever talk about the tennis or anything like that ?
you played almost two hours today , 33 degrees celsius heat . you still have perhaps three games to go . how does your body feel ? your fitness level ?
you went running after the match ? how far did you run ?
just could n't seem to get control of the match there , eh ?
were you surprised by how well she served in the clutch when it was important ?
it 's hard sometimes when she 's playing that well to keep the ball away from her forehand , huh , when she gets into the good forehand rhythm ?
is it distracting when she 's catching her toss as much as she does ?
is this the best you 've seen her play in a long time ?
you had a bandage on the back of your leg . was that any kind of a problem ?
do you think it was just one of those days where things happen where it just started off wrong and snowballed for you ?
what did your coach say to you the two times he came out ?
she shows a lot of outward emotion and seemed very into the match . but as you were saying about yourself , she was pumping herself up all the time , and i do n't think you fist pumped or celebrated once during the entire match , not one time .
there was one game where she threw it up once , threw it up twice at 30-all . she threw it up twice , served , you missed it . she goes to the other side , she throws it up once and then she serves and you missed a return .
did you get down on yourself early in the match , or did you not get down on yourself at all emotionally ?
given that you were playing really well coming into the tournament , probably your best tournament since , i do n't know , last spring , you had a couple good matches here and you 're playing a player you know well , another former no.1 , important player . any reason emotionally why you were flat ?
what did mama say to you afterwards ?
that 's one of your brothers who was there ?
what 's his name again ?
say again .
last name is what ? ivan what ?
serbian name ? can you spell it ?
maybe the best match you 've played all year , huh , ana ?
you seemed to control the rallies pretty well , you served well in the clutch , returned pretty well . you did n't really let her in the match , for the most part .
looking at your results here the last few years , what is it about this place that brings out your best game ?
do you get nervous playing her ? seems like she gets pretty tight playing you .
we know that if you 're in the front of the brain , you make the best decisions . in our research center , we found the front of the brain stays lit up when you 're having more fun . we notice you were laughing and smiling more . was that intentional ?
she had a lot of positive things to say about your game . sometimes in the past she would n't , even if you won the match . she was saying the other day maybe she feels like your relationship is evolving a little bit , that you 're both getting older , and some of the conflicts you had before maybe can be put aside . do you feel that way ?
you come to japan quite often and you have a huge fan base in japan . could you give us any comments on japanese earthquake and the tsunami ?
we noticed that marija was n't in your box today , and she 's been kind of a constant force over the past few months . can you talk about that ? are you no longer working together ?
are you looking to hire a new physio and bring them on ? are you working with adidas ?
it 's hard to strike the balance between being very fast , when you take some of the weight off , and then being strong enough , i would think .
it seems like you 're really taking control of your career now with the coaches and the physios , and you 're making a lot of those decisions yourself rather than relying on other people .
can you tell us about the next round ?
what 's your philosophy now about -- you had a couple of tosses today that were n't quite right . what 's your philosophy about if you have a bad toss ? do you try to forget it ?
just a little more on kim . do you consider her one of the players , i would think two or three , that it 's the biggest step up to try to play against her ? because she has n't lost very much in like the last seven or eight months .
you mentioned your shoulder in the last post match . can you just kind of take us through the last 48 hours , your treatments and how you 've been feeling ?
will this affect you entering key biscayne ?
were you doing rehab at home after paris and in between here , or were you just resting it ?
was it a situation today where it just progressively got worse and worse , or was there a certain point where ...
this is one of those welcome back to the pro tennis circuit moments again , eh ?
is it basically the back of the shoulder ?
after the first set , were you thinking , if i can get up to 3-1 , 3-love , something like that , maybe i can just keep the ball in play ?
how hard is it being so competitive ? you go out there and you knew you were n't feeling 100 % . to say , i have to shut it down now , is there a voice in your head saying , well , you know , maybe ...
with age comes wisdom . years ago would you have tried to play through this , you think ?
what does it actually feel like ? is it actual pain , or does it feel as if it 's locked ?
in that time after paris when you said you were resting it , did you hit at all during that time or not at all ?
tennis is sometimes dismissed as a country club sport , not really a contact sport . but talk about what , especially women on the tour have to go through in terms of the power , the torque , the new equipment , all that .
have you withdrawn from a match before , do you recall ?
although serena 's absence helps you , do you miss her at all ?
just wondering at what point in the match you became aware that kim was having problems with her shoulder ?
could you tell particular shots that she was having trouble with ? did you focus on that ?
jack kramer , very famous player in the past , said when you have an opponent who is injured , beat their brains out and take them to lunch .
what 's the t-shirt ?
seems pretty appropriate the way things happened .
they think it will dissipate ...
we 're here talking about backhands down the line and so forth , but what are your thoughts about the situation over there ? it 's in an area of obvious great interest to you .
yeah , and just the nuclear ...
you 've been so impacted in your own life by chernobyl and done a lot of wonderful work around that .
are you a little cautionary about nuclear ...
incredible .
solid outing today .
how important is it to you right now to put yourself in a position to win a tournament like this ?
can you just talk about the serve ? you 've changed your stance , is that correct , a bit ?
why did institute that , and what are you trying to do with that ?
do you feel like it helps the kick serve ?
is that a function of the racquet change or coaching advice ?
obviously you 're a basketball fan . can you comment on or talk about the basketball tournament , college basketball tournament ? were you paying any attention ? any thoughts on the bruins or the trojans , anything along those line , or are you just a pro fan ?
go ducks .
care to give us your nba predictions then ?
you have had a lot of ups and downs and really good wins and some disappointments . is it more strategic things you 've had to learn over the years or more stroke changes ? could you tell me a little bit about what you have had to focus on over these last two or three years ?
just to follow up on the nike thing , they made a lot of special designs , hepburn , red rhinestone . if you had to pick one that is still your favorite outfit , which would that be ?
yes .
the black one ?
if i could just ask , it was mentioned about the racquet change . sometimes it can be a pretty dicey thing . you have n't had that many tournaments , i do n't think .
could you talk about the change , how that 's affected your game or your stroke ?
dinara said after she got back from the australian open she called her mom told her she was going to retire because she was so frustrated with just trying to come back from the back injury and all that goes into that . can you just talk about your own experiences of , you know , being down at that level and then just trying to scrape through it ?
i guess you were n't overly pleased with how you played , based on your tweet ?
just not feeling the ball ?
you spoke about being on your tippy toes . did that come from you to the daughter , or ...
tippy toes , did your daughter teach you that , or did you teach her that word ?
when did tippy toes come into the flemish language ?
you said your feet felt like bricks then . what was happening out there ?
you said your shoulder has been hurting you for a while . what is that from ? what 's going on there ?
how concerned are you about that ?
did you have to do x-rays or is it just muscle or you do n't know ?
some of the great players have told me they 've learned the most when they had a loss , learned the most about themselves when they lost or when they played poorly . do you find your thinking changes when you 're not playing well and you learn a lot from that match ?
what 's the mindset when you 're not playing your best ? seems that lately you 've been able to get through those matches rather than your previous career . do you think that 's the case ?
so would you consider bartoli a dangerous player ?
before the start of the third set today , your opponent called for her coach . i 'm wondering when you hear that if you might not say to yourself , i got her . she does n't know how to proceed .
have you ever gotten a good piece of advice , even in fed cup , from a coach , or do you just kind of blank it out even if someone 's talking to you ?
when you were practicing , warming up today , were you aware that it was going to be kind of an off day , or did that happen once the match started ?
best win you 've had in a long time ? must feel good , huh ?
looked like you were confident at least in the second set and hit your shots , which is good .
when you had that ball , it was out by that much and she hit a net cord .
you must have been thinking , this is not my day .
would it be premature to suggest that you now should be considered a championship factor in women 's tennis ?
do you feel that you 're in the title chase , so to speak , that you could perhaps win this tournament ?
when you left australia , you were frustrated with how you played and how things went . were you sure that in a month , maybe two months if you kept working hard , that your tennis would come back ?
what did your mother say to you when you said that to her ?
have you ever dealt with anything like that before where you 've been that far down that you felt like it was n't fun anymore ?
could you talk a little bit about the tough moment you went through after the french open ? your loss to kimiko date ? you mentioned it was a tough loss in your career .
if you could go back over the past stretch and change one thing , what would you change ?
to change topics a little bit , you have not always had wonderful relationship interactions with serena , but what are your thoughts on what she 's going through now and her being sidelined with a serious condition ?
you talked about before not discussing tennis with your mother . but it seems like this time you went to her when you were n't feeling good and talked to her , not just about personal things but about tennis , too . can you talk a bit about that ?
are you kind of hesitant to talk to other players in a situation like that ? i mean , you 're competitors , but you 're kind of all in the same boat .
about what you anticipated for a first-round match or opening match ?
playing early , like you did playing early this morning , couple of times looked like the sun was bothering you in the first set . was it difficult out there ?
looked like when you had done that split like you had hurt yourself .
in the second set you spoke to the umpire about something on the far end . you had the sun in your eyes . he said , we ca n't see . what were you talking about ?
the first time you played coco , she was 16 years old and was ranked in the 600 or 700s .
she won four games . now she 's ranked in the top 100 , and she won three games . what does this suggest ? that you 're getting better or that she 's not making progress ? where are we with this ?
at what point in the last month did you feel like , okay , my game is really coming back now ?
so before last month , did you feel like at the beginning of this year and end of last year were you playing a little bit afraid ?
if i could ask , what are your thoughts about serena , and do you think her absence hurts the game ?
there are several japanese players at this tournament . i guess you heard about the disaster there .
what are your personal thoughts on that ?
the local newspaper here took a poll on the likely women 's winner here , and only about 10 % of the persons who responded picked you . what kind of chance do you give yourself ?
what 's that ? i did n't hear your answer .
no .
we all liked your dress .
have you ever been down 6-2 , 5-1 and called for your coach ?
well , today you called your coach when you were leading 4-love .
yeah . according to ...
so what 's the real estate report ? how 's the house coming ? seems like it 's been under construction since ...
so serena once said that it was really exhausting to go out to shop for , what are they called , the chandeliers ?
yeah , very exhausting . would you agree with that ?
can you be a happy person if you 're not playing your best tennis ?
if you 're not playing your best tennis .
how does it feel to be the champion of rancho santa fe ?
were you satisfied with the match , the way you played ?
what are your thoughts about serena being off the tour and struggling with such a serious setback ?
and in terms of the wta and women 's tennis ...
you said she was the best ever , so you view her as better than steffi or martina ?
we saw you watching flipkens with your daughter , and we heard her say , go flipkens . does she watch tennis or play tennis herself ?
where is she now at her cognition , her knowledge of you , of mommy as a tennis player ?
you got off the tour , came back , and said you were quite surprised how well you played , your success . do you think there is another level that you can go up ? because you 've done a miraculous job coming back .
so how much now being in a basketball family do you get into march madness and nova , and do you follow it ? what 's wrong with nova , by the way ?

talking about the crowd , i think in your match just then , you definitely are winning more crowd than your opponent . what do you think of that ? and definitely there was a time that you were not as popular as you are right now , so can you compare the two kind of experiences and say something about the relationship between the crowd and the tennis player ? thank you .
it 's a year ago that you were crowned no.1 and you 're still there and everything , but can you just give us a flavor of how your focus has changed perhaps ? because it will be quite important for you to defend your title and keep your no.1 status . and then a supplement to the li na situation , she sort of made a play about adding pressure and everything , and there has been a lot of talk in the internet and the media that perhaps now she has too much sponsorship pressure upon her and maybe that 's impacting her game . obviously you 're no.1 . you have lots of sponsored , too . can you give us a flavor of what those added pressures are actually like and how to you deal with those ?

currently we 're pretty much at the end of the season . how are you going to assess your whole performance for this year ? we know you have n't won any titles this season . how are you going to evaluate this whole season ?
( through translation . ) i would like to ask you of all the players at wta tour , who do think is the most fashionable ? in your own life , what do you think of fashion ?
currently your ranking is no.18 . how far do you think you are with the top player , no.1 and no.2 ? as a former no.1 , how long until you 'll be back in top 10 ?
( through translation . ) on the wta tour , who is your best friend ? in next year 's london olympics , do you have any plan of playing doubles ?
who is your partner ?
( through translation . ) this is not your first year to participate in the china open . what do you think is the difference between the younger generation of players and between li na and jie zheng , and when do you think the younger generation will be able to catch up with li na and jie zheng ?
this year i have made the statistics that you have participated in 28 tournaments , besides three itf challengers . they have different levels of tournaments . what are the lessons you have learned ?
this afternoon when li na talked about her loss , she considered it to be the lack of confidence . this year in the australian open , us open , in the early you have rounds very tough opponents .
how is your feeling about the game ? the beginning of first set you been struggling a little bit after leading 5-2 , but after that you just dominated the whole game . how do you assess the first victory after the us open ?
i remember last china open you lost the first round . this year you came back to beijing and you can see you 're now a grand slam winner . obviously everything made change . anything different for you as well ?
( through translation . ) the chinese media always say that you 're the nemesis on the court against chinese star , li na . how would you comment on her form ?
yeah .
does winning a grand slam give more pressure or more confidence in this tournament ?
( through translation . ) this year you have won your first grand slam title . seems right now you are in a great form . do you think in your professional career that you will be able to reach the world no.1 ?
wta report came out yesterday , and it seems like you 're highly likely to play the year-end final in turkey , but you still need some points . what kind of person you are ? are you doing the math in your head as to how many points you need , or you just take it as it is and enjoy your game in china open ?
( through translation . ) first of all , i would like to extend my congratulations on your win . in today 's match , you used a lot of slice and dropshots . is that a technique you have taken before the match ? you had plans ?
( through translation . ) how would you comment on your opponent , li na ?
you say you 're a bit surprised . can you elaborate on that ? were you expecting her to come out all guns blazing given that she was at home , or did you perhaps sense that something was not quite right and that you could take that advantage ?
obviously this is a boost to your confidence . do you think you can get quite far in this competition ? give us your thoughts on the new venue as well .
( through translation . ) in china , since li na won the french open she has become very , very popular . today with such a big crowd in the new stadium , you are playing against her in the new stadium . did that put you under a lot of pressure ?
you say it was your best win so far in your career . obviously li na was a bit disappointed and did n't have too much to say to her fans right now . just sort of wondering , obviously good fans , many of them here . how do you feel about disappointing arguably 1.3 billion people ?
i notice that you use quite a lot of topspin . is that your tactic for only this match , or you did you learn something from stosur ?
( in serbian . )
your opponent today is over 40 years old . have you ever imagined that in your tennis career or your life when you 're 40 or just 30 ?
your opponent is over 40. have you imagined your life or career after 40 , after 30 ?
( through translation . ) congratulations on your win . yesterday your compatriot , jelena jankovic , lost the match . have you had any contact with her after the match ? and recently have you had any communications with your compatriot novak djokovic ?
the serbian local newspaper reports that novak djokovic will be married at the end of this month . have you heard about this ? because other female player did n't know about anything at all .
i would like to know what do you think of the current women 's tennis ? you know , more and more women 's players have been major titles winners , also the very young women 's players . you used to be the world no.1 and you have the french open title . how do you see that ? it 's very unlike men 's tennis .
what did you think about the match ? your opponent pulled out of the match in the beginning , so what do you think about the match and your performance so far ?
some of the favorites maria and serena , quit the game because of injuries . how do you think about your chance now to win a title here ?
getting towards the end of the season now , how would you sum up your year ?
can you understand why things have not gone so well this year ?
safin is actually one of your favorite players . he played here yesterday . did you watch the match against pete sampras ? have you had a chance to talk with him ?
it 's a little bit cold today in beijing , a little windy . do you think the weather influenced your performance today ?
( in serbian . )
here are the questions from your fans . for your fans and yourself , this year may be tough because this is the first year that your ranking slipped out of top 10. so do you still have the confidence that your ranking could come back to top 10 maybe in next year ?
your friend novak djokovic will be having his wedding very soon . have you got any invitations from him ? what do you want to say about his wedding ?
yes .
in october .
when was the toughest time in your career , and how did you get through it ?
congratulations .
great performance . you were n't really in any trouble at all , were you ?
could have been quite nasty . the second point of the game , that was a bit painful , that tumble , was it ?
last couple of games were you getting ( indiscernible . )
on the court you talked about being more aggressive , and you did come to the net . coming to the net a lot more , was that in response to knowing how she plays ? what were you thinking tonight ?
what did you see from her that gave you that kind of ...
in terms of your year , how important was it to win here ?
13th , yeah .
on that same note again , it 's probably looking forward a bit , but obviously you do n't have much time to think about it . you go right to qatar . but starting to win a couple in a row in tournaments , i mean , obviously i 'm not going to bring up who you play or whatever , but what does it mean to start getting on a roll this early in the season ? this is n't grand slams , but what 's the importance of doing that ?
or is in importance to ?
is that aggressive style something that you 've always had and we do n't see that often ? you think we 'll see a lot more of that this year ? i mean , is that kind of when you talk about things you 're working on ?
when you win a tournament , do you ever treat yourself to anything , buy yourself a present ?
where do you keep your trophies ?
when you talk about hating to lose , you hate to lose more than you love to win , or is there a balance ?
hard luck . you seemed to keep blowing your nose and everything . did the virus come back ?
how can you explain having played so well to get to the final that you just did n't show up tonight ?
she takes a lot of stick for being no.1 and never winning a slam , blah , blah , blah . but what does she do well ? what is she very good at ?
what did your coach told you ?
you somehow changed your game towards the end . was it what your coach that told you to change it ?
because caroline defends so well , does that make you try to go for your shots more ?
nevertheless , it 's been a very good week when you look back .
what 's the difference between getting a really high ranking - you 've been to no.2 - and actually winning those slams ? what do you have to have ?
you 've won two slams .
but you would n't swap two grand slam titles for a no.1 ranking , would you ?
pretty important to win that off her set points , was n't it ?
how much of a help to you is your father when he comes on court ?
did he , because you asked for him early , did n't you , after you played poorly at the start ?
these are things that you know , or when you listen to him , does it calm you down ?
you were down 4-1 and actually she had four set points . what were you thinking through that whole process ? because you repeatedly came back that first set .
40-love and then ...
one thing that she talked about is she called you probably the best defensive player on the circuit . for people that are maybe seeing you for the first time , you think you showed that today ? i mean , you really were reaching the points or going way beyond in the court , and she did n't seem to have that mobility .
back to your father coming on court . the tv commentator suggested that perhaps the reason you have n't won a grand slam yet is because you 're not allowed to have your father there . how much you miss him during a grand slam ?
do you think it 's an advantage having your father as a coach ? a lot of women players have fathers as coaches , and maybe fathers can be harder in what they say .
can he be hard on you sometimes ?
i understand both your parents have a sporting background . does it help that they both perhaps know what you 're going through ?
how does the first final of 2011 feel to you ?
no hangover then either , which happens to quite a few players , you know , losing in the grand slam semifinal . but you 've bounced back .
you won six tournaments last year . i mean , i 'm not sure if you 're one of the people that kind of thinks -- would you go beyond that this year ? do you think you 're in that kind of form ? do you even think like that ? or is it just one take tournament at a time ?
when compare the australian open to now , how would you characterize your form ? were you playing the same there and it just did n't work out , or do you feel something come together in this tournament that was n't there ?
do you think it 's unfair when people criticize you or when people talk your game and they say , she gets lots of balls back , but she has n't got a big weapon ? you 've got to no.1 in the world . do you think that 's unfair when you hear people say that ?
what are your thoughts on that ?
you were saying on the court that you did n't feel you played your best match . was it the unforced errors ?
in the tournament itself , you 've obviously beaten some top-ranked players . you came in as the 16th seed . how do you feel you 've progressed in this tournament ?
you say you 're back . what 's the difference between maybe some points last year and now ? what 's the difference in your game ?
last year ?
you mentioned the use of spin . is this something you used to do more earlier in your career that you stopped doing ?
you had two tough matches before this one . no ill effects from those matches ? you were n't tired today at all ?
you must be pleased with the way you battled back , because flavia i think broke your serve four times . but immediately you sort of got back on top of her and eventually broke her near the end there to close it out . that shows battling qualities on your behalf .
you mentioned a fast start against caroline . what else do you need to do to beat her tomorrow ?
i 'm based here .
you said you were n't totally happy with today . what were the keys today to winning the match against flavia ?
in terms of your game .
you seemed very relaxed and confident throughout the match .
you seem so relaxed on the last couple of points , and you produced two terrific shots .
you know better than me .
the two forehands that you produced seemed to come because you were very confident and relaxed .
one last thing . in terms of the top 10 , if you win tomorrow you go into the top 10. is that a motivator ?
11 . 13 or 11 .
those set points were crucial , were n't they ?
a few double faults in the second set . is that a result of you being a little bit tired now ?
do you find that difficult to do , to get into the net ? it 's just natural for you to stay on the baseline ?
not coming to the net , a lot people say that 's because of the way players are taught today . everyone stays on the baseline . do you agree ?
you must be very encouraged by this . you played some good matches and got out of some tough holes .
has the racquet ever flown out of your hand like that before ?
what was she saying to the umpire ?
looking ahead , as you said , you had a pretty good tournament . compared to your mindset before the tournament started and now , where do you see yourself ? in terms of some of the big tournaments coming up , the grand slams , in terms of competing in those and even winning some of those , what do you think your possibilities are ?
do you think you 're at the level where you could win a grand slam , or you 're still not there yet ?
when you said you need to work on some things , what areas do you need to work on ?
sveta , well done .
been a tough week , but you 've come through it , have n't you ?
what was wrong with you ?
oh , right , with the ears .
what part of the plane do you fly in when you do long distance ? first or business ?
what did you fly australia to moscow ?
you must be feeling you got a good chance of winning this .
you 're fighting for every ball now , are n't you ? ?
is it easy to maintain your concentration throughout the matches ?
how did you do it ?
have you ever seen a sports psychologist to help you concentrate for a whole match ?
when you say look at the ball , do you look at the ball right onto the racquet strings ?
no . except you forget to do it sometimes .
obviously this evening 's game you had a fair few match points and sort the struggled to convert them again . this was kind of like schiavone all over again .
what i was going to say is that on the third one you just decided , right , i 'm going to get -- obviously it 's the second serve for the first match point , sorry .
second serve , and you just decided , right , i 'm going to smack this . so you obviously have it within you to win them . what is it about you , sort of besides the opponent ?
are you coachable ? you 've had a lot of coaches over the years .
some players can take everything a coach says on board , and other players -- i can think of one particular scotsman that does n't like being coached very much .
well as you say , olga still thinks the world of you .
hell of a match , was n't it ?
when you win a match as tough as that and you hang in there , you 've got to think your back again .
well , you 've been struggling for several months , various injuries , the eye . but when you play a match like that , you 've got to think ...
just on that note , it 's the second day in a row you 've had a three setter that you 've had to come back and fight for .
like you said , you 're back . but , i mean , is there a point in these two matches where you can sit down and say , yeah , i 've kind of crossed -- i mean , you must set goals for yourself in terms of this year . in some ways , have you kind of achieved a certain goal with those two matches ?
you said the first time you came in after your first match due to your injuries . was there a match or kind of low point last year where you said , wow , it ca n't get any worse than this ?
do you remember that moment ?
in terms injuries was last year your worst ?
last year you lost to stosur in the french open semis . was that on your mind tonight ?
do you guys work like that ?
caroline wozniacki next , the newly-crowned world no.1 . you 've got a 4-0 record against her . that must give you confidence . she 's yet to beat you , and you 've beaten her four times .
it 's true .
you 've been very busy . that one match too many ?
she 's very strong .
what aspects caused you problems today ?
how frustrated are you finding your performance over the last year especially where you 're regarded by many as `` the nearly player . '' you just ca n't seem to win a title .
how much do you gear your year towards peaking at the grand slams ?
what about mentally ? do you have to prepare differently mentally as well ?
is there a difference in conditions between center and an outside court for you today ? were you surprised to be on an outside court being ranked no.2 in this tournament ?
very , very impressive victory . were you surprised the way you played and dominated the match ?
you face shahar peer next . obviously she knocked you out in dubai , and you 've probably faced her other times . when you start assessing her game , what is the biggest challenge ?
what was different about playing on that court last year ? is it quicker ?
on though court , obviously you 're well aware why it 's on court 1 , but would you like to see or do you think organizers should be putting it on center court ? what are your thoughts on that ?
court 1 .
an awful lot of people during the second set last night wondered where your game had gone . you 've came back emphatically tonight . that must be very pleasing . you said you struggled to find your rhythm , but from the very beginning tonight you seemingly had it . what 's changed in 24 hours , would you say ?
a victory tomorrow would see you return to the no.1 position , i think . that must be a spur i would imagine for you .
when was the last time you played on a small outside court ?
that was the last one ?
so it really is going to be different .
the sightlines were different ?
have you been practicing out there just in case ?
vera and francesca have gone out today . your chances of winning presumably have enhanced considering there 's only two of the top 5 left , and you 're the no.1 .
and you 're pretty friendly with more or also everyone in the locker room , are n't you ?
how tough do you think this must be for shahar to come here in this situation and still play good tennis ?
do you talk to her about it at all ? have you ever had a conversation with her about it ?
you always play a lot of tournaments throughout the year . i wonder , bearing in mind that i 'm sure one of your goals must be to win a grand slam , have you thought at all about changing your schedule and playing less ?
and you would rather play tournaments than practice , for example ?
the only other time i 've seen you is in doha . today i saw it a little bit where you really get other player going back and forth , back and forth , and just wear them down . talk a little bit about your style . what am i seeing there for someone who does n't follow you closely ? were you playing your game today ? maybe describe what your game is to people who do n't really follow you so closely .
what are your thoughts on that ?
she 's a tricky player , is n't she ?
you seemed to pick your moments quite well when you needed to go for a shot . you seemingly picked her off at will . it looked quite comfortable from where i was .
there was the blip in the second set when you had a fair few chances to break at 4-2 up . you then were broken yourself . you must be pleased with the way you recovered .
when you look at the two sets , obviously your serve seemed to be working pretty well and you were hitting a lot of the forehand winners . in assessing what you were most happy with today , what would you say ?
your first-serve percentage for the first set , sorry to bring it up , but it was 36 .
obviously when get into the quarterfinals , i presume that 's a statistic you 're going to need to get up to 50 % , 60 % .
from here on in , it 's going to get increasingly harder whoever you face , whether it 's kanepi or jankovic . how do you feel in yourself ?
just a question a little bit unrelated to the match . just one of the issues i 'm looking at it is the calendar and if people are getting enough rest . as someone who 's been around for a little while , how would you assess things ? the wta rolled out the roadmap .
but other people say even though you have more time off than the men , you still need more time . what are your thoughts on that ? do you think it 's something that needs a second look ?
it sounds like that is an issue . it is a choice , but there 's also probably -- whether it be pressure from wherever , there 's pressure to chase the points and the money . have you , over time , gone from chasing the points to not chasing the points to not chasing , or has that always been your philosophy , to pace yourself ?
just one last one on that note . do you think younger players coming up , there is that kind of pressure that maybe the older players do n't face ?
do you have you got a base in the florida like a lot of the other aussies have done ?
makes it easier .
because it moves to the u.s. ?
what is your injury ?
what part ? it 's your knee ?
it 's heavily strapped . the right ankle , is it not ?
it 's hard to understand how a match can fluctuate as much as that . explain it to us .
so how do you lose a set from 5-1 , and how did you come back in the third ?
in the last five games you only dropped three points . how did you finish that strongly ?
was it hard mentally considering you were ...
what sort of spurred you on ? i would have thought having lost the second set the way that you did , being 4-1 down , it could have been very easy - but for you being a top-level tennis player - for you to just think , oh , it 's not my day today .
just on your injury , you 've withdrawn from doubles but you 'll continue with singles ?
so the injury is n't ...
black and blue ?
swollen ?
did you turn it ?
right or left ?
if it happened so early in the match , are surprised you managed to keep running ?
do you think you 'll be okay for tomorrow 's match ?
what are your thoughts on tomorrow 's game ?
after what happened in melbourne and after six match points , how important mentally for your future was it to round out that match ?
did you think about melbourne as you kept having those match points ?
have you thought about melbourne much from there to here ?
how were you physically after that match ? what was it like the next day ?
you spoke about pain . how much do things like that motivate you ?
pain after melbourne .
how do these things motivate you ?
how far are you from your best ?
what turned the match around after the first set today ?
in the final set you called the trainer .
and then you did n't look very happy with what she did for you , and then she came back on and did n't do anything . what was that about ?
blocked up ?
drops ?
you said that it hurt you in your heart and you felt empty after melbourne . does this victory alleviate it somewhat ? do you feel better ?
is that new ?
what is it ?
when did you get that ?
that was good , was n't it ? you must have enjoyed that .
why were you able to win it so easily ?
are you finding that the gap between the top-10-ranked players and the outsiders is sort of narrowing ?
with that , do you find that if you 're ranked outside the top 10 you might have a slight psychological advantage with nothing to lose ?
vera said you seemed to really enjoy playing against the top 10 players .
so when you think back on today 's match , what were some of the key points ? what do you think you had that she did n't have today ? was it the serve ?
confidence-wise , knocking out the no.2 seed , you 're now in the quarterfinals . you must feel very confident in perhaps progressing even further from here .
is it difficult to face fellow compatriots , perhaps fed cup teammates and so forth ? is it harder in some respects ?
the way you 're playing now -- and you said your game is really on -- looking ahead , is this a tournament that you have in your sights that you think you can definitely win ?
in the second set , there was a stage where it could have gone either way . there were shots won and shots lost . what was going through your mind at that time ?
could you go through the match for us ? you had a very interesting match .
was there a change in temperature today ?
quite a few of the games today have gone three sets , obviously because of the caliber of the field . i think there are 13 of the 16 seeds . so do you reckon that 's the quality you 're going to need going forward in the quarters , the semis , the final ?
she 's a bit of a heavy hitter .
she hits a true ball , so you had to do a fair amount of cracking down and running . you must have been happy with the defense . you 're aching now , but you must have been happy .
have you ever experienced a point where the ball goes through the net ?
was that after you asked her ?
so it went under or through the net ?
it went through the net .
through the top of the tape .
good sportsmanship .
in a tight match as well some competitors could have overlooked that .
this is n't wimbledon , but you had a pretty big smile on your face out there . this is even mid-tournament . sounds like this victory meant more than normal .
tomorrow you 're playing stosur . how do you look at that match ?
are we seeing the preinjury game or a different game than you would play a year or two ago ?
your reaction to the win . it must be nice to get it over in straight sets in a little over an hour ?
as you 've just said , obviously you got a second-round bye , where someone like roberta has played already . is it to some extent a disadvantage to have a second-round bye ? you come in pretty cold .
roberta 's slice backhand gave you quite a few opportunities to come in and attack the ball on a fast court . were you perhaps surprised by that tactic ? seemed a bit strange on a fast court that you were given an opportunity to attack almost .
you seemed to hurt yourself on a stretched volley in the second set . are you okay ?
seemed like you took a few games to get warmed up and settled , and then you felt much more comfortable .
you said time to figure out and understand the game , but you 're played her many times before . every match is different ?
your thoughts for the rest the tournament , how you 're feeling today , and looking forward .
did you have any idea that she was struggling earlier in the match ?
do you know what was going on ?
were you aware before the match that she had been sick this week ?
when saw her collapse , what was your first reaction ? must have been a bit of a shock .
was it right to continue after the collapse , do you think ?
did she say anything when you guys hugged at the end of the match ?
really ?
is that the most sort of shocking or scary experience you 've had in your career so far being only 20 ? it was a bit of a surprise .
how much of a dampener do you think it put on your performance today ?
why were you struggling so much in that second set after doing so well in the first ?
we do n't often see you throwing your racquet around .
do you have a temper then ? i 've never seen you have a temper before .
i take it that 's not how you want to win any game . would you have preferred to perhaps come back in the second or seen it out in the third ? you do n't want to see an opponent retire .
was it a bit unfortunate to be deprived of a good early test by the way the second set was going ?
were you left with the feeling , like just an unfortunate feeling of maybe being deprived of a good early test in the tournament ?
tomorrow 's opponent , what do you think about the match tomorrow ?
morita .
pretty good effort .
have you ever saved four match points before in a match ?
what were you thinking four match points down ?
at the start of the third set as well , obviously she 's going to you be on a bit of a downer having lost that out on four match points . did you think to yourself if you really put the hammer down there it would be over , she would perhaps crumple away ?
tomorrow you 'll be playing shahar peer . talk about that .
what would you say the difference from the first and the final two sets for you were ? what was the key to winning it ? you guys were tight .
that must have felt good .
especially in the first match of a tournament as well , to get that kind of start .
obviously sara went quite deep in pattaya . not to take anything away from your display , but do think that affected her performance ? do you think she might have been a bit fatigued or tired ?
is there sort of a worry when you 're sort of cruising as easily as you were that a sort of complacency creeps in ? i mean , you were generous enough to give her a game at one stage . does that become a worry , that it gets too easy and then your focus drains away ?
when get to a tournament a few days early as you 've done and you can just kind of casually hang around and practice , but with the intensity of the tournament , is it sometimes difficult then you go up and a gear and say , okay , now it 's time to work ?
what was it like for you post-aussie open , which must have been a disappointment ? how quickly did you put it out of your mind ?
did you feel a greater weight of expectation than you have before ?
if things go to form , an awful lot of the seeds are going to progress . i think only victoria azarenka was in a third-set tiebreaker as we speak . an awful lot of the seeds are going to progress , and as result of the quality of the field , there 's a chance they face each other in the last 16. whereas you woke up this morning and ana ivanovic is gone from your side of the draw . it opens up for you now , does n't it ? it 's a good opportunity for you to go quarterfinals , a bit further ?
really good start for you ?
was it hot out there ?
it 's okay ?
did it feel to you as good as it looked ? you won nine of the last ten games .
the commentators compared some of your shots to justine henin .
how do you explain your fantastic fitness record ? i mean , there was not only the very long match in australia , but also you never seem to be injured . you 're always playing .
does the court suit your style and the conditions , the fact that it seems to come off pretty fast off the court here ?
do you enjoy the interviews ?
do italian journalists ask different questions to the rest of us ?
string tensions ?
do you think some of the questions that we ask help you to look into your own game ? so maybe something that you have n't thought of . so we might ask you something about your game and you say , i have n't thought about that , and that might help you in the future ?
any preferences as to who you face next ? obviously svetlana is in the mix .
pironkova . it 's quite tight at the moment .
can you improve on four and three quarter hours ? five ? six ?
she 's obviously a really good clay courter . she is very consistent . how were you able to get on top of her , especially in the first set when it was so tight ?
and were you feeling a bit freer today ? i know you felt a little bit yesterday that you were pushing the ball .
and you play wickmayer or li na next . you played li na last year .
oh , well there you go . so how are you feeling about the next match ?
you 're playing doubles as well here , so tomorrow you 'll have singles and doubles . how do you think that will affect you physically ?
you 've become the marathon woman with all these long matches .
it was a real tough fight , was n't , right to the end ?
you often do that . ca n't you change that ?
why was it tough ? what were you doing wrong ?
you 've got some ground to make up after last season really . do you feel you heading in the right direction again ?
why do you lose confidence when you 're a top player ?
up next is francesca schiavone in the next round .
i finally got there , though . it 's happening . obviously it must have been bitterly disappointing to have played such a long match a month ago and coming off with a loss . what were your emotions after that game , and how much are you looking forward to playing her now ?
she is looking forward to facing you , because she says that matches against you are always marathons , and the competitiveness you both bring on the court brings out the best in each other . would you say that 's true ?
you see some players pop up maybe in the top 10 , but they do n't stay . i know how hard it is , but what are the most difficult things about staying around near the top for as long as you have ?
so you find it 's easier to get there than to stay ?
and with that situation , will you foresee that it 's now more and more difficult to stay around in the top ?
so are you saying it 's tougher now with serena not around , justine retired , venus not around at all ? it 's tougher now than with those players around ?
a sort of depth .
so now when a new player bounces into the top 10 , as a veteran of the tour , do you say , okay , next year is when we 'll see ...
so anything you 've got to tell us ? you normally have .
nothing exciting ?
no adventures around dubai ?
it was pretty quick , was n't it ?
you did n't look nervous .
so in between australia and here , you went to bollettieri 's , did n't you ?
with ?
why did you choose arizona ?
with your increased confidence , did you find yourself at any point challenged in that game that you just had ?
now , maybe you could talk about your health issues last year and where you are now . is that just last year or does it go further back ?
what about your eyes ?
was that an injury or what was the ...
a cyst or something ?
how was this off-season ?
not to continue with that , but sounds like that was probably , in terms injury , that was your worst year .
i mean , was there a point last year -- because the only time i saw you was in doha , and it was kind of unfortunate . you came in there with the flu .
i saw you playing , and you really were n't -- you really did your best , but you were struggling . i mean , was there a point with these injuries where you said -- you know , you see all these players retiring , where you thought maybe it was time to put the racquet down ? what were you thinking during all this ?
after not doing so well in australia , what are your goals this year ? i mean , getting back it no.1 ? winning a major ? what goals have you set for yourself ?
svetlana was just in here saying that one thing she 's noticed across her years on the tour is a difference in the early rounds , that the caliber of the person you run into keeps getting tougher and tougher and tougher . same ?
but is the usual first-round opponent better than , say , they used to be five , six years ago ?
why was that so tough ?
what do you think got you through the match ?
you 've done well here in the past . is this somewhere that suits your game , the conditions here ?
so what did you learn from coming out of today ? you did have seven double faults . what do you have to work on going into your next match ?
you served for the match twice and did n't serve it out . does that affect your confidence ?
on one side was it the sun or the wind ? what was the problem ?
you 've been in and around the top 10 for quite a long time now . what do you think you need to do to make the breakthrough , in the grand slams particularly ? i think quarterfinals is your best so far , is n't it ?
is it a question of keeping up a level for two weeks , seven matches ?
i was going to ask , victoria , while you would n't have chosen to get through the way you did today , do you feel it gives you a sort of instant competitiveness that perhaps other tennis players that have got through easier have n't had ? you 've come through a tough test and you 're ready for subsequent ones if they come along ?
have you spoken to caroline , your good friend ? you 're both at opposite ends of the draw . i presume you have the same agent or representation . you went out for dinner i think the other night . do you liaise on that level ?
something else we do n't know about you , how many pair of shoes have you got ?
how late did you both stay at the party ?
wow .
happy with that ?
when her serve started to falter towards the end , i mean , it became quite apparent , did you think this is your time to sort of really close it out and put pressure on the second serves ?
she had some issues with her breathing .
how are the conditions out there ?
ana is seemingly intent on getting back to where she was in the past . bearing that in mind , are you surprised perhaps that you were able to win tonight , that , again , it 's another early exit for her ?
what do you think about this tournament ? you have a lot of the top 10 players , i think eight of the top 10 are here . what do you make of your chances ?
the television commentators seem pretty delighted in announcing your age . does that bother you ?
i think you 've get jie zheng . many battles with her in the past ?
nice and quick , was n't it , for a hot afternoon to get that over with ?
happy with everything in your game ?
can she be a difficult player to play against because you 're not really sure what you 're going to get from her ?
with your win , it 's a great morning for italian tennis . sara won and roberta . you must know each other very , very well .
did you sort of collectively spur each other on before you went out ?
but it 's still a great morning for italian tennis .
sara and roberta , next they 've got sam stosur , i believe and zvonareva .
how do you rate their chances , considering italian female tennis is ...
and this afternoon , two italians have to lose and you 're good friends . is it difficult playing people ...
gisela dulko ?
what 's francesca like ? she seems a bit colorful . she 's quite a character , is n't she ? is she a good person to have as a doubles player ?
do you expect it to be fun this afternoon with the girls ?
going back to you personally , you 're obviously seeded here . how deep do you think you can go into this tournament ? it 's a tough field .
good way to start off the tournament here ?
are you happy with where your game is at at the moment ?
we have a mother who 's the world no.1 . how has marriage been for you ?
has being away from india and staying here , has that made any kind of difference to you on a mental level because of the kind of circus you have around you back home ?
with the fitness holding up , do you feel you can set sort of a goal , say for the next six months ?
was it nice to have the support behind you ? obviously the indian and pakistani communities in dubai have come out to support you in a way . attendance has been quite low , so it must be nice to have a crowd of sorts out there .
tomorrow 's match ?
how disappointing is that ?
you seemed to struggle with your serve at various stages , specifically the ball toss . that must have been frustrating . was it the wind or were you not ...
i understand that you 've come into this week without a full-time coach . you 've just had like a sparring partner and a conditioning coach . is that something you will look to revisit , or are you happy ?
so you 're not going to hire a replacement ?
does that give you freedom where you 've made your own decisions and it 's down to you ? not conversing with a coach , does it make it a more mature situation ?
on the flip side of the coin , is it not a disadvantage that other players are allowed to bring their coaches on during the game and sort of discuss , have a discourse about how the match is going , whereas you obviously are on your own , you only have your own thoughts ?
oh , right .
you obviously said you want to get back where you were in the women 's game , top 10 , potentially no.1 . caroline wozniacki earlier this week said that you could . i mean , that must give you sort of impetus going forward just to hear that . do you put too much pressure on yourself in certain situations ? does it get to you in a situation like tonight , for example ?
so when you look at you were kind of coming back at the end the last year , and then at eh australian open you crashed out early and you had this disappointment . i mean , it 's been kind of a difficult start to the year . how would you rate yourself at this point ?
oh , okay .
so your stomach injury has healed , but it 's more or less building up your fitness ?
obviously since picking up the injury at the hopman cup your childhood friend nole has won the australian open . serbia are davis cup champions . would you like to be a part of that sort of serbian sport bubble at some stage ? the country must be on a high tennis-wise at the moment .
going back to that , he obviously has worked hard to get where he is . you 're prepared to do the same . is that sort of methodology , you 're going to work , work really hard , harder than the rest ?
one last question about the match . in the second set tiebreak , when you had the dispute with the umpire , i did n't quite understand what you were complaining about .
a lot of players challenge after they 've carried on playing the rally , do n't they ?
do you think they need to perhaps change the rules then ?
difficult conditions out there . you looked pretty exhausted .
was it temperature ?
no , i mean you had a temperature .
you complained of dizziness ; is that correct ?
having gone so deep in pattaya and won the tournament , you must 've come into this one fairly low energy-wise .
is that a problem on the tour , that there is n't enough space ?
in fed cup you 're playing serbia april .
i think ana and jelena will play both , and bojana jovanovski now who is uprising . what do you think about that match ?
your first win in three years , and now this disappointment . how do you look forward from here ?
you spend your off-season on the photo shoot , the calendar for the hiv victims . can you just talk about that .
how did you pick that hospital in cambodia ?
when do you leave for doha ?
seemed to be a lot of errors out there today . are you frustrated with your performance ?
what did you think of your opponent 's performance ?
there were some good things in your game though , were n't there ?
nine double faults . is that a disappointment ?
why did you go indoors in paris instead of perhaps playing in thailand ?
you 've had health and injury things in the last year or two . do you feel 100 % now ?
do you have a particular goal this year ? have you set yourself a target in terms ranking ?
did last week make you think , i really live with some of the best players ?
excuse me for asking this . i know you prefer not to answer this . do you have any contact with your father ?
both players looked very tired and exhausted . was it the weather ?
are you happy to get into the second round after like two or three first-round defeats ?
you had a good second half of the season last year . how do you place your game now ?
did you feel you 're gradually making progress back up again ? it 's slow , but you 're going in the right direction ?
how is your confidence ?
what do you expect from yourself ? do you give yourself little targets ? big targets ? no targets ?
do you enjoy the life , the travel and the tournaments ?
you 're not alone , but it must be difficult for a player who 's been at the very top of the game to struggle for quite a long time .
why do you think you lost it for a while ?
you spoke about having issues with motivation some time ago . has it changed ? do you feel more motivated ?
it 's very competitive on the tour . are there any colleagues or players or others who have supported or helped or encouraged you ?
dubai does n't seem to be doing you any good .
what 's happening ? is it the evolution of the game ? are you trying out something new ?
what about your game ? do you find you 're playing better than you were ?
what will you do to correct that ?
so you 're not getting enough practice ?
does hold good memories for you because you won here before ?
physically are you feeling okay ? at one point you were working on your wrist in the second set .
nothing wrong with the wrist ?
is it windy outside ?
would you think about doing something else besides tennis ?
you 've not thought about anything for the future ?
any plans for today ?
anything for valentine 's day or anything ?
how does that feel ?
this is the first premier event you 've won . is it the best you feel you 've won ?
were you quite nervous at the start ? there was a few double faults .
what was the turning moment for you ?
did you genuinely think you could come back from 5-love down ?
going into the tiebreak , did you feel like you were on top given that you had come back and kim had only won one of the six previous games ?
how is the confidence now heading into next week ?
did kim seem a little rattled to you ? was it not just your performance , but did she kind of lose it a bit as well ?
has this one given you belief that you can win the australian open now ?
more than before tonight ?
is it just a confidence factor ? you just feel ...
was there anything you identified in kim 's game that you discussed with your team that you thought you could attack or matchup pretty well against her ?
is it also a case of beating kim clijsters ? talking about confidence again . it was n't someone else , it was kim clijsters . do you think that has given you a little push now ?
she said that you should be considered a contender at grand slams , but that you sometimes get a bit nervous .
do you think a win like this will help you in the later stages of a grand slam ?
there 's a lot that was made this week with you and your husband . have you had a chance to talk with him yet ? what was his reaction to your win ?
have n't you ever thought about taking a new coach then ?
have you ever thought about taking a new husband ? ( laughter . )
not yet ?
talk us through from 5-nil to 5-all , execution .
does a match like tonight make you want to go back on the practice court ? melbourne starts on monday .
those three double faults , that was very uncharacteristic .
is she a genuine australian open chance ?
such a marvelous end to the season last year with the us open and the championships . is this sort of a reality check , make you feel like you 're human ?
do you need these sorts of results to move to the future , make changes in the game ?
does a result like this have an impact on you psychologically going into melbourne ?
quite an easy match for you today .
were you frustrated then pretty early in the match because things were n't going your way ?
this is your first premier final ?
have you ever started a season playing as well as you have this week ?
have you ever played better in the first week of the season than you 're playing this week ?
who do you expect to see in the final ? who do you expect will be your opponent ?
you won the gold coast , you 're a semifinalist here and in melbourne , and now you 're in the final of sydney . what is it about australia ?
is it something simple like the same time zone ?
if it is kim clijsters that you play tomorrow , can you tell us your thoughts about playing her .
how long does it take for your knee to get strapped each time ? how long does it take you to get that ready for a match ?
i know you tape it .
how much work do you need to do on it before you play ?
just the knee or the rest of the body as well ?
is this run here in sydney giving you more confidence that you can perhaps go as far as the semifinals in melbourne again this year ?
disappointment must be too small a word to use , big game , big match .
a match of that quality so close to a grand slam , is that also very heartening for you ?
kim had a quite easy run until today . you were the first one to really push her today .
the crowd seemed to turn against you a little bit after the second injury timeout . did that affect your confidence in the match ?
is it important for a player of your ranking to have beaten such a player before going into the match like this ?
does it help you ?
the scheduling of your match late last night , did that have a pretty significant impact on today 's result ?
you went out first round in brisbane and you make semifinals in sydney . did you have an injury in brisbane ?
how are your back and foot at the moment ?
you played very focused point by point . that 's the mindset you have to have . but when it 's 6-all in the third set , do you then think , oh , last time it was 6-all then too ? does it cross your mind then ?
did you have a particular game plan in mind for kim ?
do you know what 's your very best , fastest serve ever ?
tougher than you expected ?
were you pleased with how you reacted when you got into those situations ?
the way she seemed to slow down , the way her game was heading , particularly during points and things like that , was that frustrating you ?
the injury timeouts , did you feel there was some gamesmanship going on there ?
what kind of recovery will you do to get up for tomorrow ?
a massage ?
you have play with na li five times , and only once after your comeback . talk about her game .
do you think kleybanova is better than a 25 in the world player ?
is there anything in the big , slamming groundstrokes kind of play that troubles your game particularly ?
the quality of this match , would that be sort of quarterfinal , semifinals of a grand slam ?
and from your side though , the match tonight and then obviously a final tomorrow , that 's the sort of thing that would be ideal for you ?
two sydney titles . another one here , what would that mean ?
do you still embrace the aussie kim sort of thing that australians still associate you with ?
keep making finals in our tournaments and maybe you should get your citizenship .
so you made a good comeback today .
tell us what happened .
so the energy just came to you ?
both you and svetlana struggled to gain much consistency throughout the match , and there were a number of unforced errors . why was that ? because of opposition 's game plan or conditions ?
how tough it was today , is that going to affect your next match ? will you still be tired or fatigued in the next match ?
what do you feel like you did well today ?
sometimes when you went behind you your head would go down . are you confident now that whatever situation you can always come back ?
later on in the second set you looked like you were about the lose the game . how did you change that , and what did you say to yourself mentally to change that ?
how do you see your chances in the rest of the tournament ?
the results do n't perhaps suggest how difficult a match that was .
there 's a lot of other top players knocked out . do you sort of feel like this tournament is yours for the taking ?
in terms of the australian open , it must give a great deal of confidence as well obviously some of the other ladies , sam , zvonareva , a few of the others , have n't been in such good early-season form . you look like a bit of a step above , so you must be quite confident .
your last six months has been fantastic since the us open , the last half of the year . did anything change around that time that sort of has brought on this sort of consistently high form ?
no key to what 's brought this very high form on ?
do you feel maybe in australia now there 's a little less pressure than four or five years ago when you were right up there but maybe fighting to break through ? now that you 've won back-to-back at the us open , you come out here and there 's a lot less to prove ?
you 've been one of the favorites , but next week 's open you 're the absolute raging favorite . is that a little bit different than what you 've had in the past ?
is it your goal to get back to no.1 ?
have you ever felt better heading into the australian open ?
are there any weaknesses in your game at all at the moment ?
was the wind an issue at all tonight ?
so serving was the thing that was a bit more difficult tonight ?
how did you feel about the way you played today ?
will it affect your preparation that you wo n't have any more proper matches between now and melbourne ?
i guess you had only one day in between your arrival from hong kong and your match now .
you mentioned about thinking too much about the tactics and technical aspects . is there a point at which your game , you release all that and sort of play very naturally ? is that when you play your best tennis ?
does your loss of today mean that a victory over the no.1 in the world , 6-0 , 6-1 in hong kong actually means nothing ?
how much belief has making the us open and wimbledon final give you heading into this year ?
now you have a couple of days extra to adapt to the conditions . is it kind of a bonus ?
what did you think of today ?
does it knock your confidence around at all , a loss like this ?
what were the positives ?
you 've traveled quite a lot in the last week : thailand , hong kong , australia . are you feeling a little tired from all that ?
you going straight to melbourne , or will you stay here ?
do you feel like you game in practicing feels pretty good ?
you said the other day you were comfortable with the new racquet . is there anything that you 're struggling with to make that adjustment ? i know novak a couple years ago and made a change at the beginning of the year and was struggling .
did you expect her to be such a tough opponent ?
do you feel that other players are going to raise their game against you now that you 're no.1 ?
the way she was able to attack your second serve , was that worrying at all ?
how do you feel about your serve generally today ?
what do you think your weak points were throughout the match ?
can you talk generally about looking forward to melbourne and what you think your chances are there , what it 's like going there as no.1 ?
what 's your goal heading to melbourne park ? what do you want to work on in the next week in your practice matches ?
do you think you 'll be match-fit and prepared for melbourne ?
this tournament obviously , because it attracts so many of the top players and it 's only a small draw , you kind of go into it and it 's almost like midway through a tournament , is n't it ?
you face someone who 's very strong and playing well immediately .
what do you make of that ?
obviously lost first round last year and went to melbourne and made the last 16 there . pretty confident you can turn it around again ?
do you have any family in queensland affected by the floods ?
what are the things you said you wanted to work on heading into melbourne ?
the inevitable question you 've probably been getting , probably the pressure again has got to you , that , you know , two second rounds and people expect you to get to the quarterfinals at least .
your groundstrokes , do you feel as though the timing was n't there today ?
with serena out next week , do you think the australian open is winnable ?
is there a certain sense of pride though , 20 years since we 've had a top 5 seed in the australian open in the women 's draw ?
when will you head to melbourne ?
so would you like to have a few hits around sydney before friday ?
what went wrong in those two service games in the second set ?
so a more difficult day for you today . what was happening out there on court ?
did you have to call your husband on te court when you lost the second set ?
so maybe in the future you wo n't call him when you 're in trouble .
you were talking about jet lag yesterday . have you recovered a little bit from that ?
sleeping a little better last night ?
so you were n't sleeping on the way to the match today ?
what do you hope to improve this week to be ready for melbourne ?
so for today , what do you want to do better in your next match ?
just going to ask you again about your husband . i know you 've been sort of joking about him for the last couple days . was it him that persuaded you to come back to tennis when you took the time out to go to university ? tell us a little bit about how your relationship as a player/coach has developed .
just going back again , when you took time out to go to university , did he persuade you to come back and try tennis again ? i read you did n't want to come back and play tennis again .
this was 2005 ? national games ?
is that the best you 've played in a while ? you looked pretty good out there .
so playing a hometown girl , it was swirly , threat of rain . what was your attitude going into the game ?
so no discomfort for you when you dropped the first set obviously ?
you looked fitter , and looks like you have a new coach out there . have you been working in the off-season ?
did it help calling your coach after the first set ? does that help you ?
what were his instructions at the end of the first set ?
looked like you took the slice serve , took the pace ofd the ball . was that a strategy for you ?
vera was in here a little bit earlier and talked about how sometimes she feels like she has so many options on the court , she can hit every single shot , and it can get stuck in your head a little bit tactically and technically . seems like you have a similar game in that way as far as you can hit every shot .
does a win like this make you sort of reevaluate what your expectations in melbourne might be ?
are you a little surprised how well your technical and mental game came together so quickly ?
what do you think sam did right today ?
it seems to be going very smoothly for you this week so far .
do you worry when it goes this well , or not ?
did you sense how frustrated she was getting ?
how confident are you at the moment ? you seem to be confident just from your form in sydney and the exhibition matches . are you full of confidence ?
is your family here already ?
they travel with you everywhere ?
does that help you sort of decompress between matches and think about other things and come fresh to tennis each day ?
does that take the pressure off you as a tennis player ? you do n't put pressure on that you had before or ...
is that your first win over a player ranked no.1 in the world ?
did you give yourself a good chance going in ?
how big a confidence boost is it for you , especially to win in straight sets ?
2010 was a bit of a frustrating year for you . what have you changed about your game or the way you approach games to start 2011 so well ?
your thigh , is there an injury there or just a precaution ?
does this win change your ideas about your chances of success at the australian open ?
how did you cope psychologically having been top 15 and getting the injury and falling down a little bit ?
have you set yourself a goal for the australian open and for the season ?
you mentioned a game plan . was the game plan specifically towards caroline or just about your own game ?
you did rack up more winners and unforced errors . did you decide just to go for broke ?
takes more confidence to keep going for the winner after you 've made mistakes .
you came in in good form after auckland . what did you expect of the match today ?
how does it lead leave your preparation for the australian open next week ?
do you think sam is good enough to win here ?
you said you played her a few times . did you see anything different about her game today after the off-season ?
seemed like it was a bit of an arm wrestle for most of the match . there were two periods where she kind of got on top . did you feel she went up another level ?
have you set yourself a goal for the australian open ?
what did you work on in the off-season ?
so you got one on the board in sydney .
looked like you were able to lift your level when you needed to .
a lot 's been made of your forehand , but also there was a quite a few crosscourt to backhand winners , a nice few winners . that must be a nice feeling as well .
particularly nice one to get the breakpoint .
i know this time last year we were talking to you about you felt like you were n't managing the expectations of your home country being the no.1 player because it was new to you . clearly that 's no longer giving you issues .
how disappointed were you to go out the way you did in brisbane ? did you get over that quickly and refocus ?
how much better was today than last week ?
your reward is svetlana kuznetsova . second round does n't get any easier , does it ?
what about your serve today ?
your ability to seize the moment , the two breakpoints , that 's obviously got to make you happy . i suppose it 's a sign of class that you 're able to rise at the right time .
is it also a matter of getting used to serve and service directions of your opponent ? the first couple games she hit ace after ace almost and then you could cope with it .
you said you handle the pressure better now than last year . is the pressure and the expectations not higher than last year ?
were you elected sportswoman of the year ?
but there is no sportswoman of the year , all sports together ?
what would be the ideal preparation for you this week ? how many matches do you want ? is it as many as you can get ?
is this one enough to sort of sustain your confidence no matter what happens now , do you think ?
many top players have been invited to play invitationals and exhibition games . did you play any ?
have you been asked for ?
so if you had had proposals for last december , would you have taken them ? or maybe they would not have fit in your program .
just wondering what tennis players do with their prize money and endorsement money .
do you have property in america ?
have you noticed this week the crowds bigger or more kids following you this week in the practice courts ? is it similar ?
so how did you feel about your match today ?
you did n't look sleepy on the court .
you obviously had a fantastic time in australia last year with the semifinal at the australian open . does it give you hope for a similar result this year ?
did you have a good off-season ? do you feel prepared for this season ?
do you will feel you 're a better player this year than last year ?
are you better now going into the australian open than you were perhaps last year ?
did it make a big difference to you in your mind reaching the semifinal at the australian open last year ? do you feel like , yes i can win a very big tournament at some point ? is it confidence ?
so you had to sort of get that out of your mind ?
just think about ...
when you came back to beijing last year after the australian open there was a big party . do you feel pressure now from the chinese people , expectations that you 're going to do well again ?
the australian open is called the grand slam of asia and the pacific . does it feel like a home grand slam for you ? does it fell like it 's the closest one for you ?
are you staying in the same place in year ?
you played venus in hong kong .
how good do you think she was playing ? i mean , obviously you beat her .
so no change ?
( question and answer in chinese . ) can you translate that ?
why did you change the coaching situation ?
( no microphone . )
what did you do better in the second set after the first ?
talk about dealing with her forehand , her big strength .
what 's more satisfying , the long three-set victories or a quick victory ?
you 've been on the tour for a long time , just as ana . can you compare her level of game three years ago and now ?
there was one point in the second set that you seemed very upset with yourself , talking to yourself . do you recall what was bothering you at that moment ?
you 've now won nine straight matches . do you feel like you 're playing the best tennis of your career ?
on that note , you lose the first set . you 've won so many matches . you dig down deep and not panic in the second and third set ?
do you feel this is one of your better starts to a hard court season this year ?
( question regarding ana 's toss . )
you think there should be a rule that you can only catch four tosses a set or twice maybe ?
did you ask the chair umpire to tell her to stop catching the toss ?
do you want to talk about radwanska . obviously a different type of player than ana .
( question regarding managing the shoulder during the match . )
have you ever been involved in anything like this , where a player ran off the court in the middle of a game ?
did it throw off your rhythm at all ?
what makes your game work better when you ca n't serve as well ? do you concentrate more or do something differently knowing you ca n't serve as you might want to ?
starting the second set , you win 10 games in a row . what changed during that period of the match ?
so when she got back to 4-3 , were you thinking , no way she maintains this level ? or were you thinking , now i might have to raise my game even more ?
one , it does n't look like you get very tired . only a couple times when you were running . number two , it looked like you were playing inside the court , trying to push her back . you were dictating a lot of the points .
i could hear you joking with the crowd afterwards about starbucks . can you talk about that .
are you working on a new sponsor ?
in the final game when you were serving for the match , she started playing really well . did you feel any pressure that you needed to really serve that match out then because she had found herself again ?
did you feel like you played a good service game ? you were n't nervous at all ?
when did you make up your mind that you could actually play today ?
you 've won other events . do you count this as the biggest victory of your career ? i know you won eastbourne .
can you talk a little bit about what different challenges either vera or ana will provide tomorrow ? will you have to play differently depending on each one of them ?
are there different keys to doing things well against vera as opposed to ana ?
you have n't won a tournament since 2008. you 've gone deep in a lot of tournaments , beaten a lot of good players . i would think winning another tournament would be important to you mentally ?
so you feel ready physically , mentally , the whole thing ?
can you talk about how the court surface compares to the one from last year .
can you tell us exactly what happened when you sprinted off the court so quickly ? how long had you been feeling badly before then ?
i would argue a guy would have up-chucked on the court and not cared about it .
did you feel better ?
what did you eat for lunch ?
you said you dropped in intensity , left the court . then you made a good push at the end actually . talk about that .
it looked like you ran faster off the court than you were during some rallies . do you feel that way ?
had that ever happened to you in a match before ?
it looked like you were wobbly .
when she served for the match , by then you were playing much better . did you feel like if you could have broken her there ...
ana is a good friend of yours . she 's struggled this year . talk about some of the things you like about her , maybe reflect on her struggles . do you have confidence she 's going to push through and become a great player again ?
looking back on this tournament , you 've played really good . next week you 're going to be in the top 10. talk a little bit about how you feel about that .
pete sampras was on sportscenter once . you did n't want to be like pete ?
after wimbledon , how do you judge where your game is ?
are there any 'what ifs ' in this situation ?
kind of let it get away from you at the beginning of the third or end of the second , but still close .
physically your legs were going ?
tough , too , because she changes direction a lot , a very physical player .
overall the week was pretty good for you , good wins , close to beating the no.3 player . you have to be pretty happy ?
how do you make yourself maybe not go for too much on those second serves where you could have stayed in the point maybe ?
what parts of your game are you most encouraged about starting the hard court season and what do you feel like you need to work the most on ?
does the veteran in you know that you 'll take a lot out of a loss like this , maybe more than when you were a teenager ?
did you see your draw next week ?
she has n't played since wimbledon .
is this an example of where maybe inexperience comes in a little bit ? got away from you fast after you seemed even to start off .
it gets away from you so fast sometimes .
do you know the rest of your schedule this summer ?
will you need to qualify for the open ?
you were kind of alluding to obviously the emotion that you showed after you did n't hold serve and get that point . you seemed to be well-loved by the crowd , got a great ovation after . the tour loves the fact a fresh face like you is having fun out there .
have you picked out those shoes yet ?
christian louboutin ?
the 3-2 game in the first set , were there any points you wish you could have back ?
you were talking about the experience . after the match , andrea just had rave reviews . she kept talking about fresh air , you hit a heavy ball , have a lot of talent . what does that say when someone that is highly ranked is praising you instead of talking about herself ?
she 's an experienced player , highly ranked , top 15. did you get a sense that she sort of was able to pick your game apart , find a weakness and exploit it today ?
you 've now played german women twice in the last two rounds , correct .
i just wondered if you found anything similar between the german women , if they 're all maybe coached to play the same way , if there 's any patterns there you discern ?
andrea is known for her dances after the match . did you happen to catch what she did ?
it was a short one .
can you talk about the first set , how much of an effect your shoulder had in the first set . you called for the trainer .
what kind of treatment did you have on it after the match ? are you confident you 'll be able to play tomorrow ?
after you received treatment in the first set , you played much better coming out . did that actually have an impact on how you felt out on the court ?
with as busy as a schedule that you played , when you lose 6-0 in the first set , did you give any consideration to pulling out at that point ?
is it kind of a relief to play the early one ? you 're not playing tonight . you 'll get six or seven more hours , do treatment , let it rest for tomorrow .
does the competitor in you naturally come out when you lose 6-0 , and you do n't want to come off the court being embarrassed like that ?
so you figured even without your first serve , you were playing well enough to where you believed you could win the match , change things up , even without the serve ?
were you surprised almost when you won the second set , considering how your shoulder felt , just how far behind you were ? it almost seemed like you surprised yourself by coming back and winning that .
given what you went through at the end of last year when you could n't get up , you could n't play , then you came back in january , do you feel like you can deal with pain very well , that you can put it aside ?
you know when there 's a danger zone when you think you should not go past a certain point ?
your shoulder may have been hurting , but in the third set you won your first three service games at love . how surprising was that ?
at the start of the second set , daniela seemed to come out mixing up her shots , throwing some high balls at you . do you think she was trying to test your shoulder a little bit ?
you had talked about your shoulder . you said it 's some sort of a nerve issue in your shoulder , correct ?
so you 've had some tough three-set losses this year . must be nice to win a difficult three-set match . does it do something for your confidence ?
you brought up the point that you seem uncertain concerning whether you will continue in this tournament . as you sit up there at the moment , what do you think it will be ? do you think you 'll be able to get out there or do you think this is it ?
as i understand the wta rules , you 've now qualified for the semifinals . whether you play or not , you 'll get paid as a semifinalist . might that have any bearing on your decision ?
it 's a complicated question . but you have now qualified for the semifinals , right ?
as i understand the rules , having qualified for the semifinals , you 're going to be paid as a semifinalist regardless of whether you play .
would that have any bearing on your decision whether you play or do n't play ?
how long has the shoulder bothered you and have you been told you ca n't damage it more by playing ?
does it just hurt on the serve or on wide forehands ?
you feel it even on your backhand ?
could you tell her youth and inexperience showed a little bit there when she let it get away so quickly ?
do you remember any of those moments when you were just out on the tour where you felt like , how did that happen so fast ?
from a tennis standpoint , your experience plays a big part , you 're a better player than she is at this point . what do you get out of a match like that ?
speaking of your career , when you decided you would become a pro , i think you said your father got upset .
can you talk about the semifinal matchup with radwanska .
do you see sloane in the top 20 or 30 ?
obviously your tennis is speaking for itself . your dancing afterwards , did you give thought into that ?
what did you think of sloane 's dance there in the second set after she won the game ?
is there any buzz among the players watching serena come back , especially the way she played last week ? do you talk about that ?
can you talk about the week you had here . seven wins in a row before today . how do you feel going into the open ?
how did the delay affect you ?
did they tell you if they were considering moving things inside ? how close were you watching the hurricane ?
can you talk preparations going to new york ? are you worried about traveling into the storm ? are you staying here ?
what makes caroline so good ?
did you have a strategy going into the game ?
going to the finals . how do you feel ?
what happened to your leg ? is it going to be okay for the open and the finals tomorrow ?
just a little pull ?
what is it about this court , this place ? 16-0 is amazing . you 've never lost here .
on the other side of that , can it add pressure when you see what novak went through at the beginning of this year up to the french open , had all those wins without a loss , sort of felt a little bit relieved in one sense after the french . does it also add pressure when you 're on a win streak like that ?
talk a little bit about the celebration at the end . the football team came out again . there was rory in the yale jersey .
i think you broke at 4-3 in the second set . she had you 15-40 , yet you battled back out of there . do you feel that frustrated her to the point where the match was yours pretty much ?
talk about the one point that seemed to be the turning point in the match where you hit the dropshot , she hit it over your head , you somehow got it back .
have you kept in touch with any of the girls in new york and it feels relaxing for you to be here and not in the craziness they 're going through in the next couple days ?
have you figured out what you 're going to do through the hurricane ?
how much do you know about your opponent tomorrow ? you 've never played her .
is that harder going into a match , never playing your opponent before ?
you seemed to be in control of that match until the point at 5-5 with the big rally . did you feel a momentum shift there ?
what makes caroline so difficult to play ?
is there any one shot of hers that stands out ? sometimes her backhand is noted as being tougher .
talking about the breaks in the second set , she broke you to go up 4-3 , then you had her 15-40 with a chance to break back , but you ended up losing . was that her consistency ?
how do you think you 're playing heading into new york ?
how concerned are the players about this hurricane coming ?
when will you leave for new york ?
how does it feel to win your first qatar ladies open ?
your 11th title . must be quite sweet for you . could you compare this victory with the us open victory in the semifinals ?
was it a victory of believing in self or ...
you were solid in defense and you were aggressive . is it the key of your victory today ?
you realized with love-2 it was very important to win these points ?
what was the worst moment of the tournament during the match before against jankovic or hantuchova ?
what is your positions considering the no.1 position in the wta ? this is your main goal , or this is a grand slam victory ?
you played well for sure tonight , but do you think that caroline did n't play good tonight ?
towards the end you remember that the ball was in and it was called out and you ran out of your chances for review . what did you feel that time ?
will you come back to doha ?
where do you go from here now ?
next tournament ?
i want to ask you , today you played a special technique . according to how she plays or you just played your own way ?
do you feel pressure because people want you to win the grand slam after two finals ?
excellent seven days and finally this . what went wrong today ?
is it possible to know what was the small little difference between both players today ? because it was so tough and so tense .
you lead 2-love in the second set . you looked to go in front of you , but she come back .
you have been playing nonstop since the start of the season . do you think you need a break now ?
you do n't like to make it easy for yourself , vera .
did you watch the first semifinal before ?
you 've got some pretty close games with caroline that have gone both ways recently . i 'm assuming you 've got some kind of plan you 're going to have , a set of weaknesses of hers that you 're going to think , right , i 'm going to try and get her there ?
when you look at her game generally and the games you 've played recently , what is it that gives you -- she 's pretty consistent . what part of her game do you think , okay , that gives me some hope ? because it 's not just all about whether you play , is it ? it 's about both of you ?
but you feel close to her in the rankings ? i know you are close to her in the rankings , but you do n't feel you 're playing somebody who is crazily better than you or anything ?
do you think maybe when you 're playing the no.1 player in the world , those lapses you 've had in the last couple of matches when , you know , you 've lost a set and maybe not played as well for a small period , you know , is she more likely to punish those than the people you 've played in the last couple of matches ?
you have two very tough matches . are you in physically good shape ?
you played some three-setters on back-to-back days . on the other hand , caroline has had it a little easy . how much difference is it going to make in the final ?
yesterday and today we see you when you go to lose and everybody say , vera is going to lose . you 're back . that 's your tactic for this match ?
why was that so easy ?
i mean , you pretty much did n't put a foot wrong there . i mean , can you play better than that or is that it ?
what do you get more enjoyment of ? you come off the court playing like that . it was comprehensive , it was easy . clearly you 're smiling ; you feel happy . do you get more of a thrill out of that or more satisfaction coming out of a grueling sort of three sets where you had to really fight for it ?
i just read a stat somewhere that says since the beginning of 2009 you have now made twice as many finals as anyone .
yeah , nice stat to me , as well . but what does that say ? that 's not just because you 're playing more tennis than other people . that 's because you 're at the top of your game , right ?
marion says your ball is more heavy . it 's heavier than last summer . do you feel like that , too ?
what would you do if you were playing against you as a tactic ? because it looks like whatever anyone does you get the ball back . it 's like playing against the wall .
these days , you know , in egypt we had problems and yemen had problems , and people had rage , you know . so was it tonight , for you , night of rage , something like that ?
rage , you know , you went out and just smashing ball , and , you know ...
no , i mean considering that in your last two matches , bartoli had beaten you , so maybe this time you wanted to go out and crush her for that ?
you made it last week , in dubai , you won dubai tournament . do you think you are going to win in qatar and whom you prefer to play against tomorrow ?
was that like hitting against a wall sometimes ?
do you have any ideas what those things are yet ?
do you think there is an argument against someone like her who gets into such a rhythm ? she has such a rhythm from the back of the court , that maybe throwing in a bit more slice or a few shorter balls to make her think -- a couple of times when you came into the net , you caught her by surprise and it worked . do you think maybe you got caught into a little bit of a trap trying to play her own game ?
mentally , as well , having watched you a few times this week , it seemed to me today all the routine things you do between points , when you were struggling a bit , you almost stop doing them as much .
from here , where are you going next ? home and then indian wells or kuala lumpur ?
do you think you made too many mistakes but still you had your chances to prolong the match , no ? what do you think ?
maybe your first service game helped you ?
so is steven gerrard going to warm up in a caroline wozniacki t-shirt before his game tonight ?
i do n't know . i think maybe you want to send him one and get it signed . see what happens .
have you met him before ?
you just need to learn how to speak in the accent now , and then you 'll be fine .
i wanted to ask you a question about your next game . shahar peer yesterday , after losing to marion , said if she carries on playing like that , she 'd be the no.1 player in the world . what do you make of that ?
what 's stronger , the coffee or your performance ?
shahar yesterday said you played so well yesterday that if you played like that all the time , you 'd be the no.1 in the world . is she right ? is she crazy ? you tell me .
did you watch the copenhagen match last night ? what do you think about it ?
what went wrong ?
so your chances of winning the next tournament are better than their chances of getting past chelsea , right ?
are you in good shape now after the virus ?
this tournament does n't seem to be turning out good for seeds . five seeds have lost in three days . is it a good signal or bad signal ?
how tough is your opponent tomorrow , pennetta ?
i think that 's now the fifth time since paris that you 've gone out in sort of your first game . are you finding your game fluctuating more ? are you worried at all about that ?
what are you like when you lose ? are you the sort of person who lets it get inside of you for a long time ?
no , no . what kind of person are you , like how do you cope with it ? how do you deal with it ?
did you feel before that you were not at your top ?
are you really surprised with the way you 're playing the chinese player today ? are you surprised or are you already played against her ?
was the wind affecting you or conditions ?
what happened exactly ? what went wrong ? was it serve putting pressure on you ?
i mean , you played much below par than you normally play , so that was the most surprising for all of us .
suddenly recently you have been playing well , and you came to the tournament with , you know , a positive frame of mind , i suppose .
seemed to be missing right from the beginning .
you 're saying you obviously got something inside you that 's not quite happy or enjoying it or something as much as before . i mean , do you just need a couple weeks off ? do you need to relax and then look forward to the clay ? the clay is fun , right ?
are you suggesting sometimes you have got to play when you do n't want to play ?
yeah , it 's tiring . quickly , where are you going next ? what is your next move ?
home to sleep ?
is that one of the best wins of your career , do you think ?
fair enough . you 're honest .
just satisfaction , happiness .
what is your best victory in your career ?
can you explain why you were in qualify , you were injured and now you are in good shape ? can you explain exactly what happened these months ?
do you think you have the same level as when you were in australia last year now ? do you have the same level of tennis today compared with the australian open last year ?
francesca was saying , you know , today she just was n't feeling right . sometimes you come to a tennis tournament , and maybe your mind is not there , or you 're physically exhausted or you 're emotionally exhausted . do you understand what she means ? sometimes as tennis players , you play so many tournaments , you 're traveling all over the world . do you understand what she 's sort of going through ?
this is your first win in the main round here . last time you lost after winning the first set in 2008. but it 's a brilliant start for you in the main round ? good start in the main draw ? good match win in the main draw ? i mean , because last time you had lost in the first round after winning the first set . but this year , this time getting ...
yeah , getting the first win in the main round with victory . brilliant start ? what do you think ? after you won -- you had lost the first round in 2008 .
in doha . so first victory in the main round . it 's a brilliant start to the tournament in the main round for you . better start to the tournament this year ? better than 2008 ?
how do you feel just to play marion bartoli tomorrow ?
you 've got 20 , 24 hours now before that game . what do you do ? what are you going to do ? do you sit in your room and watch dvds ? do you go do painting like marion ?
i saw the match , and it was difficult to see if marion was very , very up or if you were not here .
you called your coach at 6-1 , 5-love . did you believe still in yourself ?
do you think she will win against peng if she play like this ?
how would you sum up your experience in the middle east over the past two weeks , dubai and here ?
there was always some controversy about your trips to dubai and doha . do you feel that you are more settled now , you 're more comfortable playing in this region ?
do you think the political debate has more or less settled and people are more comfortable here accepting you as a player ?
you come in here quickly . you seem in a hurry . have you got an exciting evening planned that you 're not telling us about ?
what do you and your mom do in the evenings ?
is it that you played better or she played bad ?
could you tell us , what did you change in your game today to create difficulty for your opponent ?
in the first set at 4-all , you hit an unbelievable backhand . do you think at that point you took control of the match ?
now that you 've finished the week and you 've got the title , where is your game at and where do you want it to be ?
does it surprise you that it 's been 10 years since you 've won here in canada ? do you ever just marvel at the fact that you 've been on the tour for that length of time already ?
i forgot that you mentioned you 're having your 27th birthday this fall .
do you have any big celebrations for your 27th birthday ?
in the last game , you had a little trouble closing her out . was that nerves ? if so , what was going through your mind at that moment ?
you played a lot of matches in the last few weeks , more than you 're maybe used to going into the us open . how do you feel physically ? is there any chance you wo n't play cincinnati ?
it could be stosur again in the second round .
i 'm the rogers cup poet in residence .
i 'm going to be writing a poem in honor of your victory today . i wanted to know what phrase you 'd like me to use in the poem . do you have a favorite phrase or description of yourself ?
`` narly '' ? i 'll use that .
can you talk what you were feeling at the end of that match ? you had four aces in that final game , and you seemed quite pumped at the end of it all . can you talk about what your mindset was like ?
you seemed quite pumped at the end of that . is that a normal serena-type reaction , or was it just -- a lot of people were saying that was a real exclamation you put on just coming back the way you did with those aces the way you did in that final game .
what was your game like when you first returned to the practice courts following your layoff ? did you ever have frustrating moments where you doubted you would be able to return to this level ?
you have talked in the past about trying to go after federer 's grand slam record . now that you see novak doing what he 's doing on tour , is that something to try to go after , as well ?
he 's on his way , looks like . he 's 53 and 1. can you imagine yourself ever going on a tear like that ?
two years ago , as you may recall , kim clijsters came back from a retirement , did n't play many tournaments , and went on to win the us open . i just want to know if you see any kind of parallels that you also , just coming back for the couple tournaments , if it 's a good omen for you to remember what kim did .
this is a toronto question i have been asked about a million times this week , so i 'm gon na ask you : what 's the story with drake ?
congratulations , serena . i just want to find out the situation of your sister . how is she doing right now ? have you heard from her after the victory ?
congratulations on your victory today . you 're undefeated this summer in hard court . do you consider yourself a favorite to win the us open ?
looking a bit further , i know it 's only -- it 's a year away , but do you plan on coming and defending your title at montreal where you have n't played in a while ?
did serena play the way you anticipated her to play , or did she surprise you today ?
how would you compare serena 's level of play today to the previous times that you have played her ? and are you surprised that she 's been able to reach this level so quickly in her comeback to the tour ?
before serena went out to serve for the match , you had had a very good seventh game . you won all four points and maybe were inspired by that . at that time the main scoreboard ran a clip thanking fans for coming out to the tournament , asking them to buy tournaments for next year . i was wondering , did you hear that at all ? and if you did , did that give you any inspiration to go out and prove the message premature , or did you hear it ?
can you talk a little bit about the upcoming us open and yourself and your confidence , where you were a week ago and where you are now and the difference ?
why did the sunglasses come off in the later stages ?
when you heard the thunder out there in the second set , did that change your approach at all ?
you had quite a lot of fan support throughout the game . how much of an impact did that have ?
if the draw holds in cincinnati , you might meet her again in the second round . i think you have a qualifier first . i 'm sorry if i ruined ...
if she continues to play as well as she has , do you expect to do something differently when you meet her , or was there so little between you that you just have to play the same type of game ?
you must have been awfully pleased with how the match started . you 're sitting at 4-all . there did n't seem to be a whole lot of difference between the two of you at that point . she breaks you to go up 5-4 , and it seemed like from that moment on , the match went in one direction . what happened at that point ?
i 'd like to congratulate you on your final appearance .
how would you compare this game as against all the other games you played during the week ?
if you do play serena again next week , will it be nice to get another shot at her so quickly , or is it tougher to kind of put this result away ?
i was just wondering if i could ask you how intimidating is it to come up against a player like a serena out there , given her competitive drive and her talents ? and what she 's done in such a short time coming back from these health concerns ?
i 'm aware that in australia tennis is considered like hockey here , perhaps the most popular sport .
you mentioned yesterday you 're only playing cincinnati in the run up to the us open . you 've played new haven in the past . i 'm wondering if , at this point in your career , you 've found kind of the best way for you to prepare for a grand slam ?
congratulations , first off . that second set was so tight , and then the third you just kind of steamrolled her . what do you think changed ?
can you talk a bit about where your confidence level is right now ? is it as high as it 's been this season and seasons past ?
do you have a preference of who you play tomorrow , azarenka or williams ?
can you talk about what this tournament means for you and your career ?
you said you did n't have a preference or did n't want to make a preference in terms of opponent tomorrow , but if you do face serena after her long layoff that she had the past year -- this is only her fourth tournament , as you know -- what kind of feat is it if she does make it to the final to play you after that long layoff ?
i think your record in the final is like 2 and 8. i just wondered , what does it take to move into that category of greatness like the williams sisters and possibly sharapova ?
does being in the top 10 mean anything to you ? if it does , what does it mean ?
you say `` possible . '' what do you think is possible for yourself ?
why is it so hard to maintain a consistent level over a season ?
and do you have any sense coming in whether or not it 's going to be a good tournament or you 're going to find your game that week ?
you have n't played a whole lot lately . today you played a player who was basically playing every day for two weeks . what can you say about where you fall in that divide of playing an awful lot and trying to pace yourself so that you 're fresh ?
how much are you gon na play after tomorrow before the us open ?
can you just talk about the flow of the match a little bit ? you know , you seemed to pick up your game in the second set . did you feel kind of a difference between the sets in your level ?
how big a factor was fatigue in this match for you ?
you 'd be the best judge of this : stosur will have to play one of two very in-form players . how do you like her chances tomorrow ?
can you give us some specifics about the shoulder ? is it something where you just need a little bit of time off before the us open ? is surgery something that you 'll have to do after the season ?
and despite the loss today , how confident are you feeling heading into the us open ? do you feel like your game is as strong as it 's ever been before a grand slam ?
i saw in practice that your back was also taped . is that another injury , or is that to support the shoulder ?
today i believe if you had won you 'd be back in the top 10. is that something that matters to you ? do you think about that during the tournament week ?
if you had won .
it sounds like you 're not going to play any other tournaments between now and the us open , right ?
are you playing cincinnati ?
do you think that 's a good idea ?
your dad has n't been here these few weeks coaching you , right ?
can you talk about is that a different feeling , you know , the relationship with a coach who is not your father ? is there anything you can kind of do that you would n't be able to do like if your dad was around off the court ?
would you say that you 're exceeding your own expectations so far since you 've returned to the tour , or are things going as you hoped and thought they might ?
other than that grand slam , the last couple of tournaments and how you 're playing so far here in toronto ?
in the post-match interview you said that there was a point in the match where you thought , maybe i should try a little harder at this point . and at 2-2 it seemed like you kind of turned it on , so to speak . do you think it 's fair to say you 're one of the few women in the wta who can turn it on whenever you need to ?
how do you feel about the spectators in toronto ? do you feel they 're supportive ?
you seemed to have difficulty hitting your forehand shots . is there a reason for that ?
did you make a special effort after wimbledon to sort of step it up in terms of your training , getting physically fit , and do you think that 's paid dividends both in stanford and here ?
what exactly would you have been doing that maybe you would n't have done in the past in terms of getting fit ?
do you feel any kind of kinship with roger federer ? he just turned 30 , and i think you hit that mark .
what changed after the first set ? because your game , the intensity level , everything seemed to change after the first set .
and did you find her left-handed serve , was that something that took getting used to ?
being off for so long , what part of your game was the toughest to get back to your usual standard ? and what part did you find , what aspect came back the quickest ?
what came back the quickest to you ? what was the part of your game ?
what can you tell us about your next opponent , victoria ? you have n't played her in a while , and she 's had a great tournament so far .
winning easily .
at this stage , you 've played a few tournaments but not that many , considering how long you were off . do you feel like you 've been back for a long time , or do you still feel like , you know , you 're coming back from a layoff ?
congratulations , first of all . for you guys , this is a grind , obviously , but for fans in toronto they only get to see you guys once every two years . so when you make the semis like this , it 's an introduction to the city when they really catch on on the weekend . how aware are you guys of that idea of becoming a big deal in a new city , and what have your impressions of toronto been ?
for toronto , in general , your impressions ?
it looked like you were serving really well out there . is that something you have been working on , or it just came together ?
at what point do you think , i can win this thing ?
did you have any problem with roberta , different style of play ?
at the end of the first set , along the same lines , you seemed to be running around the forehand a lot . was that a conscious decision or did that just sort of happen naturally ?
in honor of your victory i 'm wearing sunglasses in the press room . i wanted to ask you , i did a little survey from a lot of eye surgeons , and a lot of them are wondering , why are n't there more tennis players wearing sunglasses ? because you obviously care about your eyes . they claim that the longer players go without wearing sunglasses is going to result in a lot of eye damage later on . i just want to know if you are wearing the sunglasses not only for your health -- it seems to be almost as much of a trademark for you . i just wanted to know if that 's a conscious effort that you made early in your life .
you were pretty dominant in that second set . what was your mindset going into that last set ?
can you just comment a little bit on the two potential opponents you 've got in the semifinal ? their style is different , approach it differently ?
do you like to watch the games of your competitors coming up ? like will you watch this afternoon 's match live ?
does it feel a little bit like deja vu this week again ?
can you just talk a little bit about how your shoulder is doing ?
after the win last week , i 'm just wondering how you 're feeling about your game , because obviously you 're rolling through this tournament , as well .
very dangerous opponent today . how is it you 've matched up so well against her thus far in your career ? i think it 's four straight wins against her .
you were 3-love up and then it was 3-all and then it was love-30 . did you feel then it was slipping away a little bit ?
does it make it harder with the shoulder to really believe you can come back ?
do you know exactly what it is with the shoulder ?
you have a new coach . do you think that played a role in your recent wins ?
do you feel that your ranking is a bit misleading right now just with the way you have been playing ?
do you feel like you 're a better player than what your ranking is showing ?
is your goal to win a grand slam or to be no.1 ? is that what you 're always thinking about ?
which of the grand slams do you think you might have the best chance at ?
can you just talk about playing stosur tomorrow and how that matchup looks to you ?
what 's special about your game ?
you must know what you do well , what you think you do well .
at least you did n't have to run off the court this time .
she 's a little bit of a different player . what makes her so tough ?
you have been one of the brightest personalities here at this tournament . we saw a different side of you today after the first set .
was that a help to you , do you find , generally when you do that ?
on that theme , we think of tennis and especially women 's tennis as a very genteel game but is one of the sports that encourages those kind of outbursts . seems like that 's john mcenroe 's mystique . that 's the mystique of a lot of players is that they flip out on the court . do you think that 's kind of expected that when things are n't going well you should start smashing your racquet and screaming ?
how do you feel about being the highest ranked player left standing ?
how concerned were you playing here today , considering that she beat maria and then she beat bartoli and she was playing very well ? were you worried going into the match , or did you know much about her beforehand as well ?
are you surprised , i mean , she has n't had that much of a record in singles , that she did so well this week ?
that 's something that you 've really sort of been managing to do ever since march is really bring good tennis every week . can you talk a little bit about sort of that discipline and just what it takes to keep that focus ?
do you have any sort of specific tricks that you use ? i mean , i know you started listening to music walking on the court , things like that . can you talk about that ?
i saw you in may . i believe it was your last hard court appearance where you won in key biscayne over maria . do you see some similarities between playing here in toronto and at the sony ericsson open ?
you 're sort of from the same generation as kvitova . when you see her win wimbledon , does that sort of make you think , that could have been me , or are you a little frustrated that she got there first for a grand slam ?
do you have a quick word about each of the two possible opponents that you could face tomorrow ?
you have matched up well against serena in the past . can you talk a little bit about , if it is her , what you need to do and what is it that you do that 's given her trouble in the past ?
is that the important thing ? just the fight ?
what does it feel like to see your ranking where it is and see serena 's ranking at 70 or whatever it is ? does that seem strange ?
did you see any of the matches she played in stanford and when she won that tournament ?
when you 're watching , are you watching out of curiosity or are you watching as a professional sort of scouting to see exactly how she 's playing ?
what were you doing last week ? was it just a practice week ? did you come here early ?
did you get a chance to do anything else ?
speaking of being busy , obviously you 're still rolling in doubles play , as well . what does that take out of you this week ?
just wanted to get your reaction to making the quarterfinals , beating sharapova today .
i guess this is proof that anything can happen . that 's why you play the games . as a qualifier , you 're not really , on paper , supposed to be able to beat the no.5 seed .
from that last match , what did you gain that you really thought you would be able to take advantage of from her game heading into this one ?
yeah , the previous match .
late in that second set , how were you able to , when you were frustrated , how were you able to maintain your composure and finish off the match ?
did you have a sense , coming into this week , that you were going to play like this ?
can you talk about working with alina this week , what you guys have been doing and what 's been helping ?
during your run , has there been any part of your game that you 've surprised yourself in how good you 've been ?
were you surprised by how easy that was , how one-sided that was ?
are you surprised how well you 're playing , given that you were sick in the final of the san diego open ? you 've responded so well .
you have been mentioning focus and intensity a lot in the past conferences . you did pretty well out there being focused on every point , except maybe for that bee thing that happened at one point . is that something you 're working on , to be focused on every single point ?
you had a very good game today . people are going to expect you to go far now in this tournament . which player would you fear , if you fear one , in this tournament right now ?
i saw on twitter you posted a picture of you talking tactics with ana ivanovic . you admitted later you were gossiping , but does it help having that kind of personality on the tour , makes it more enjoyable , less of a daily grind , and actually helps you out on the court ?
please keep tweeting like that . we enjoy it .
do you feel like you 're gaining momentum as the tournament goes along ?
and you really must enjoy being in canada a little more now ?
what has stosur done that you found particularly challenging in the times that you 've played her ?
did the fact that this was your first match of the week play a factor , do you think ?
curious how you 're dealing with the amount of attention you 've been getting since the french open , how you 've been handling it and if you 've noticed it much on just playing smaller tournaments on the tour .
just wondering if you felt any rust at all , this being your first tournament back since wimbledon .
do you feel any different since the wimbledon win , like maybe players view you differently or do you view yourself a little differently ?
you mentioned the wind . what kind of issues and what kind of problems was it causing you ?
how did you spend the time after wimbledon ? did you just take off tennis altogether or were you just practicing ?
even though you lost today , do you still take some positives and do you feel like it 's nice to get back into the swing of things now that you 're competing again ?
you were one of canada 's last hopes . how does it feel now after losing today ?
did you feel any extra pressure representing canada out there in toronto today ?
how much did the conditions play a factor in your game today ?
what did you like the best about your performance today that you can build on for the future ?
you have actually never won here in toronto . is there something special about this tournament , the scheduling , something that 's just not working for you ?
what was the difference after you went up 5-1 ? what changed at that point ?
it seemed like the wind was causing you havoc , especially on the lobs . can you speak a little bit more about what it was like playing out there one side versus the other ?
what are some of the positives you might be able to take out of your match today , if any ?
i wondered if the wind was particularly troubling on the toss . a couple of times you retossed a couple of times . was it wind-related ?
can you speak a little bit about your opponent 's game today ? she seemed really tenacious in terms of defending the ball and just keeping it in play .
did you feel that the wind was a factor in the match today for you ? how did you feel or deal with it ?
i was wondering where that win ranks in your career in terms of all your victories . did you do anything different last night to prepare against someone who was ranked no.1 ? did you eat anything differently or do anything differently ?
what was , i guess , going through mind as you started rallying back ? you 're down 5-1 , picking up a game at a time . at what point did you say , i 'm gon na take this match ?
where does this rank on your wins in your career ? is this the greatest win ?
definitely your clay court is where -- i think it 's safe to say it 's your strongest court . this is your first hard court tournament since wimbledon , your first tournament since wimbledon . how do you feel heading into the us open ? do you feel you 're going to have enough time to get ready ? do you feel you will be a threat on a surface that is not your strongest ?
so that was a pretty long match out there for the two sets . i think some crazy amount of deuces . how do you deal with such a long match ?
you probably know each other really well , too . did that come into play for such a long match , also knowing what the other girl does ?
i think i saw you on the practice court afterwards . was that because you were n't happy with how you were hitting ?
just a general type of question . how much of your game do you feel like is natural talent and how much of it is hard work ?
when you first started playing tennis , did it come very naturally to you ?
there are a few of you like that actually these days , it seems . like kvitova , for example , said she did n't really start playing until she was 16 .
petra kvitova .
so it 's still important to have the natural talent , then ?
you mentioned on your twitter last week that you fell in love with a canadian director , xavier dolan .
is that part of your routine , to watch a movie from the country you are going in ?
have you had a chance to try the beer ?
as you were saying , so many players right now in the women 's game can just come through . anybody can win . how does that affect you mentally in terms of sort of both feeling like there are no limits but also sort of every round is very dangerous ?
could you just tell us what led to your decision ? what happened out there ?
what 's your reaction to not playing today ? is it disappointing not to get your first match under your belt today ?
were you expecting this game to play against her , your countryman ?
did your win last week in vancouver really help your confidence for your performance tonight ?
did you feel that the qualities that you had that helped you win last week they were evident today , like it was the same sort of play you were playing last week that you were playing today ?
last time that you played was a very different situation . i do n't know if there was less pressure or not , because at that point canada was basically trying to go for world group position in fed cup against israel , and shahar kind of had you that day . i wanted to know two things : a lot of double faults by both players . were you affected by the low setting of the sun in your eyes ? it seemed like everyone had a lot of problems with the vision and a lot of discussion with the umpires about whether the balls were in or out ; and secondly , did you notice any kind of situation with shahar where maybe her game was n't quite up to what you expected ?
this tournament has not been kind to canadians in the past few years .
two canadians with yourself and stephanie moving on to the second round . your reaction to that ?
how are you enjoying , if you are enjoying , the sort of virtual combined that we have in toronto and montreal ?
with the win in vancouver and the win today , how good do you feel going into the rest of this tournament ? what challenges do you see will be the most difficult going forward ?
after trading breaks early in the first set , you took control of the match , basically . what changed ?
can you comment on how you were feeling at the beginning of the first set ? looked like you were grabbing your thigh or something .
was the virus last week just an ordinary stomach virus ?
are you still feeling it ?
did you ever figure out what it was ? something that you ...
how much are these warmups at the us open going to play a role into how well you actually play there ?
you mentioned played sloane last week . and now eugenie this week . how do you compare the two ? when you sort of have a young player coming up , what are the things that tell you whether or not she 's going to be good ?
i assume you have a top 10 goal for this year , to get into the top 10. how are you going to get there ? you 're getting so close now .
sorry , for the top 8 for the wta ...
when you hit top 10 this week , did it feel like a big milestone ?
what did you do to kill time during the rain delay ?
one of the things i 've always admired about you is that you seem to let pressure rub off your back . when i saw you in miami i loved when you did the petko dance and a few other things . but i want to ask you on a more serious level , now that you 're in the top 10 , i want to know , in germany , the expectations are for you to be another steffi graf . and coming from a country that had both boris becker and steffi graf , are you hounded by the german media when you 're going to be no.1 in the world ?
what were you reading earlier ?
you 're playing doubles with ana again this week ?
looks like she 's starting to play better and find some consistent form . is that something you sense playing alongside her ?
( off microphone . )
since winning this tournament in '06 you have been up and down . how are you feeling about your game these days , and what have you learned from maybe the last few years on the tour ?
you said at stanford that it was the first match of the new team . you were kind of nervous . can you talk about last week and this week ? are you feeling sort of more settled now ?
two victories in one day . is that just happy day or it is beside something else ?
your first-round match would have been very different had venus not pulled out with a virus . i 'm curious with venus and serena having been away for a long time and now coming back , whether you sense any different dynamic around the tour ?
it seems like there are a lot of former no.1s and fluctuating in the rankings . maybe some of us even underestimate just how difficult it is to stay up there .
when you sort of go through those periods , how do your own expectations change ? like , you know , compare yourself , what your expectations are now compared to six months ago or a year ago or 2008 .
i want to ask , the first set seemed like a really hard-fought battle , looked like you were getting frustrated at points in it , but in the second set you came out really strong . you seemed like you were happy . you seemed like you had a whole new attitude . how much did winning that first set change your mood and really help you cruise through the second set ?
i wanted to ask how much the crowd was obviously behind you , hometown favorite . how much did that support help you throughout the match ?
did you have your own personal cheering section with you here today ?
in terms of your confidence , how important was it for you not just to win but to win the second set as emphatically as you did ?
so for you , looking at your rankings , you 're always kind of like on the fringe of the top 100 , sometimes breaking into it . how important is it for you in terms of your entire career to really finish this season strongly and kind of get into the top 100 and stay there ?
i noticed you were getting to a lot of dropshots today . how do you prepare and stay in shape for that ?
just wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit about what it 's like interacting with the press using this technology back in montreal ? what 's it like interacting with the press in montreal ?
yes .
how was your first experience of the rogers cup , and how nervous were you ?
when you say you learned a lot , can you be more specific , some of the things you feel you can take from this match moving forward ?
what was your plan going into today 's match ?
i wanted to ask you , one of the interesting things i imagine in this experience as you play someone like petkovic is that probably in your mind are you wondering whether you want tennis basically to further your education as an ncaa scholarship , which i 'm pretty sure you 've touted to be , or are your goals right now , after playing , do you say to yourself , maybe i could be one of the top wta players one day , so let me turn pro when i could ? which route do you prefer to take for yourself ?
do you feel any pressure playing in front of the home fans ?
obviously not the start you were looking for . just talk about what did n't work for you today .
you were having some problems with your hand . was that a factor today ?
without looking at today 's match , just talk about what the problem turned out to be and how the recovery has gone . is it okay now , or is it still ...
voskoboeva has had a successful year so far , but you 've always had success against her . what can you take out of a loss like that against a player who you 've always had success against ?
you have gone 4-0 against her .
specifically , i 'm not sure .
i read that you came to toronto a bit early . can you tell us when you actually did arrive , and was the purpose just to try to get acclimated to the weather and the city and all that ?
can you talk a bit about the dropshots that she was making ? that seemed to have some success against you .
obviously late start , but seemed like you really picked up the game in the second set . victoria as well stayed tough , did n't she ?
you 're only a couple years older , and yet it seems like there are some similarities to the point where she might have watched you modelled some stuff on you . do you sense that you 're playing someone similar to you ?
you only managed to hold your serve once today . was there any particular problem , or just it was an off day ?
at the beginning of this tournament you said about your expectation for the french open .
that you want to do well at roland garros .
can you explain a little bit more ?
you 've gotten so much traction with your service return in some of these matches , yet today your serve was n't working .
how did you feel about that ?
semifinals indian wells , final here , back in the top 10. do you still need that one big win to get your confidence so you can feel like , okay , i can win slam again , or you feel like you 're there already ?
have you made any changes in your equipment , particularly your strings because of your shoulder ?
could you repeat what went through your mind when vika hit those two nets in a row at 3-love ?
can you elaborate just a little bit more on the illness ? what was wrong in those couple three weeks before indian wells ?
normal/abnormal .
how many practice days did you miss ?
at the end of the first set you had a meeting with your coach . what do you and your coach talk about ?
so much was made of your shrieking early in your career . did you feel like you met your match today on the court ?
were you not aware of what 's going on at the other end that way ?
what does it mean to you to be back in the top 10 ?
do you feel like the women 's game is wide open with the williamses gone , justine quit , kim 's back and forth and caroline 's never won slam . do you feel like it 's there to be had ?
when are you moving to miami ?
talk about the match . obviously you got off to a great start after the 1-1 situation and maria was spraying the ball . you just played well the whole way , did n't you ?
how did you break her so often ? was it her serve or were you so confident in the return game ?
you seemed comfortable and relaxed . is that the case , and why was that ?
you seemed right at home .
what is it about the conditions here or in miami ? do you think it 's a coincidence that you 've won two of the last three times here against big time players ?
what 's the key about your patience ? because in the past , you lose your head and you lose the match .
what 's the key ?
you talked a few times about being so happy and not caring about losing and stuff . you mentioned you had a bad period after dubai . talk a little bit more about how you arrived at this present mentality .
what was behind this gesture here after you won ?
you did n't realize it was match point ?
maria 's only two years older than you but has been around for a long time . when did you first see her ? there are similarities in your games . is there anything you took from her watching her coming up ?
i think most athletes would probably tell you if you do n't care if you win you 're probably not going to win . seems contradictory .
the last three players you played in the tournament , clijsters , zvonareva , and sharapova , they made a lot of mistakes playing with you . do you think it 's just a coincidence , or it 's your game that makes them play not too well ?
were you thinking of quitting when you came to that decision a few months back ? if so , what would you have done ?
were you thinking of quitting ?
how does that trophy feel different from the one two years ago ?
is it any different winning it the second time ?
now that it 's all said and done , who has the better shriek ?
did you think she was louder today ?
what do you do with $ 700,000 ? when they hand you that check , does it boggle your mind ?
is there something you want to buy ?
have you heard from caroline yet ?
do you think you 're able to win a grand slam this year or to be no.1 at the end of this year ?
you have n't won a lot matches last year on clay . what do you think you need to improve on clay this year to do better ?
when were you first aware of maria ? wimbledon final ? did you see her on tv ?
was that a junior tournament ?
with caroline wozniacki , did you learn something from her ?
when you got the two let cord winners in a row to win that game , were you thinking , this is my day or what ?
do you have a preference in terms which major you would like to win ?
but your game seems perhaps better suited to hardcourt , you think ?
do you feel that by winning the tournament , like maria , that you 're going to be getting more endorsements ? you have the perfect name to sell victoria 's secret .
when you say home , is it minsk ?
when are you going to play doubles with caroline ?
you won in memphis .
you had great results when you played with shahar peer , too . any chance of that ?
are you going to drink champagne tonight ?
can you talk about your pants ? there are a lot of holes .
you did that yourself then ?
april fools . are you into fashion ?
what does your mom design ?
6-3 , 6-3 against clijsters , 6-love , 6-3 against zvonareva . do you have something special these days to win so easy ?
you were talking after your last match about your happiness on the court -- or everywhere . what do you put that down to ? why do you think that 's happened ?
at indian wells i understand that your coach kind of urged you to stop with the hip injury . said if you stop you 'll be good for sony . is that story true ? and if so , are you grateful that he had you stop at that time ?
did you agree with him at the time or the decision to stop at the time , or did you try to fight it ?
it 's going to be a battle of two people who fight to the last ball tomorrow . you had a good win against her the last time you played , but what are your sensations about the final tomorrow ?
can you talk about the last time you played ? i know you 've beaten her twice . what did you do well in those matches ?
is maria a friend of you on the tour ?
how much does what you 've done here excite you for the clay court season and what you might do there ? if the result works in your favor , you could be back to a career-best place in the rankings . it 's looking positive .
you have a french team around you .
there is a french touch in your game and your attitude ?
yeah .
what 's a french sense of humor ?
do people recognize you in key biscayne or around the area here ?
do you have any question about your grunt and the one of maria ?
i have a supply with me .
you seemed to be a little bit angry yesterday with the public , with the noise they did .
after the match you answer a question and you said to the public ...
what is the atmosphere here like for a final ? you 've been in one here . what 's it like ?
how much does it help to have this day off ?
is it an advantage to have won this tournament two years ago ?
in light of the week you 've had and with the weather conditions today and she 's playing great , how satisfying is that win today ?
she said that one of the things that makes you such a good champion is that you sense right away a weakness in the other player and basically you jump on that . she said that she felt that you sensed she was hesitating , whatever . can you talk about that ?
she thought you would be tired in the third after the long match you had the previous night . did n't seem to be that way .
it 's the steps , is it ?
clearly you feel physically good , strong . you say you were hitting your groundstrokes pretty powerfully in the second and third set .
is that the best you 've served in a while ? you really picked it up in the second and third set .
you were very dominate in the second set . going into the third set , how did you feel ? did you feel there 's no way you could lose or this match is still up for grabs ?
seems like the russian women were really dominating the game five years ago , and that 's changed lately . you may meet vera in the final . will that be exciting ?
what would it mean to win this tournament ?
are you back ? do you feel like you 're back to the top , you can get right to the top again ?
talk about what happened with your shoulder and sort of the process of coming back from this and maybe why it took a little bit longer than you hoped and how you 've had to adjust your form to help your shoulder more ?
have you had to change your serve ?
how about now ?
do you and sasha ever exchange competitive strategies about each other 's sports ?
he 's had his ups and downs over the years . every athlete does .
talk about certain situations ...
is there any one piece of advice you gave him or he gave you that stayed with the other person ?
i did n't mean to say what it was ...
have you exchanged things ?
your return of serve today again was very phenomenal , and you also mentioned it earlier . has that always been such a strong part of your game ?
talk about your match maybe against azarenka .
you started out very strong today and played very well . can you tell us a little bit about what happened ?
was there any fatigue from the past matches ?
do you have any problem in your shoulder ?
can you compare maria today and australian open ?
why do you feel you lost your intensity ?
what is maria 's best quality , do you feel ?
how would you describe your whole week here ?
you said you felt some fatigue . going into the third set , did you mentally feel that you were still in it , or did you feel it slipping away ? how did you feel at that point ?
you 're going to be in the top 20 for the first time in your career . obviously it 's consistency , so i guess the next step is get to the top 10 .
you have a lot bracelets ? any special meaning ? and no rings .
is the dance officially retired , or is djokovic stealing the dance ?
great match . i guess you did n't do much wrong out there . i notice the trips to the net , 25 of 32. got to be pleased with that .
you seem so relaxed on the court . i do n't know if you changed your way , you mental approach to tennis . are you more relaxed out there than you used to be ?
you will meet either clijsters or as azarenka . talk about each one .
what did you learn from the two grand slam finals that you were in ?
i know that you 're an emotional person or have been on the court in the past . is that something that you 're over , i guess i would say , or that you 've talked to anybody about ?
is it you hate to lose that much or are you a perfectionist that bothers you the most ?
can you talk about your second degree ? that sounded interesting . are you still going for that ?
i ca n't imagine doing both . how tough is that , and how many other players would do that ?
what 's your thesis on ?
is it about like a future goal for you or more just about being educated ?
what kind of products ? obviously i know that you 've got great vodka and a few other ...
like caviar ?
at the moscow events that you play in , which i 've been to , like fed cup , it 's nice , but there is a difference in terms of the events , let 's say , in the u.s. or somewhere in europe . do you think with the international community coming for world cup and the olympics that russia has to step it up now ?
all the studying you do online , i 'm assuming .
i also saw here that i guess you 're a women 's advocate . i saw a gender equality promotion and involvement with women in the caucuses or something like that .
do you know much about when billie jean played the battle of the sexes with bobby riggs ?
really was n't to show that a woman tennis player can play with a guy tennis player , which is not easy , but .
how did you get through that last game ?
who are you ?
do you feel like you can beat anyone at this point ? you take out a no.1 , you take out a former no.1 , and you did you it in championship style . confidence ?
was the rain delay helpful for you ? because you had a really slow start .
you put a lot of emphasis on your game plan yesterday . today did you have a plan going in ?
did you discuss a new strategy as a result with your coach during the rain delay ?
do you sense that there is a lot of opportunity on the wta side these days ? you have a no.1 who has not won a grand slam event ; you have a couple of champions struggling , like maria sharapova . is there kind of an open field for some of you other girls who might want to take initiative and go forward ?
there was also a change of style , you think , and we had a generation that was sort of quite defensive . you mentioned kvitova , yourself , attacking players .
are you ready to beat another former no.1 , if sharapova wins ?
do you have a game plan against maria ?
speaking of doubles , are you watching your partner 's progress here ?
when you say you always believed in yourself , how precise was the belief ? you believed you could reach the top ? you had a specific goal or just believed you could make it on the tour ?
who was the most difficult to beat her ? wozniacki or jankovic ?
are you ready to win this tournament ?
when you talk about your fitness , how much time do you put into your fitness as opposed to your on-court stroke work and details , technical ...
what kind of running ? distance or ...
for those that are getting to know you , can you talk a little bit more about your celebration dance at the end ?
how tough is that one to accept ?
you okay with the way you played the match points ?
five match points over the no.2 player in the world give you something to look forward to ?
why do you withdraw in doubles ?
this was like the serbian open today .
talk about ms. petkovic . a lot of us do n't know her very well . obviously she did well in australia . i know she is 23. can she beat anyone out there ?
and she 's really a serb , of course .
and she 's really a serb .
what did you do last night waiting all this time ?
were you crying after the match or you just broke your racquet ?
you said you were n't feeling well coming into indian wells . was there something physically wrong or just fatigue ?
do you have a coach now ?
so how was that for a match that came from nowhere ? i mean , it was an amazing win .
with her being up 5-1 in the last set , do you feel for her ? i mean , because in your prior interviews you said that she 's a great girl and you always root for her .
there was an awful lot of games from 5-1 to finish . do you think at all that you might win at that time ?
you could n't make errors .
she basically said that whatever the rankings , et cetera , you 're the woman to beat on the tour . you 're in control . how much of an advantage does that give you in these situations ? do you feel that yourself when you 're out there in a situation like that , saying , you know , it 's still me , that 's still her ?
you had 14 winners and only 52 errors , a lot of them particularly on the forehand side . what was going on with your forehand today ?
what made her so tough today ?
are you a little bit mentally tired ?
she was a surprise for you today ?
she looks very aggressive . do you feel it ?
after the match she said that she and her coach developed a plan to beat you . she said a lot of people make the mistake of going out there and just trying to hit with you , hit harder and harder and harder . but you handled that very well . today they said , we 're going to mix it up . do you think there 's anything to that , mixing it up against you ?
you use on-court coaching a lot during the tour , but you ca n't use it during the slams . do you think it makes a difference in your game ?

can you talk about how maria sharapova is playing ? do you see her becoming one of the top players again ? she 's been out for so long and struggling with the arm .
this tournament you really could have cemented your standing as the no.1 player . how disappointed are you not to take advantage of that ?
when you are winning as much as you have lately , does it come as a surprise to you when you lose , or does it hurt a little bit more or a little bit less because you 're kind of on a roll ?
do you think petkovic has quality to be top 10 ?
i do n't know really what was going on out there , but there were people around me that were saying that you were being a little more emotional today than you normally are . were there greater frustrations ? there were some screams or , you know , you were upset with yourself in some ways . was that unusual for you , do you think ? or were these people wrong ?
do you think you were being a little bit more emotional than you normally are ?
you said the other day that if you won another slam it would mean more to you perhaps than the previous three .

your website is linked with kei nishikori 's at the moment about the japan charity . can you talk about that a little bit or how you became involved or wanted to ?

what is it you like about serena ?
a lot of people in tennis are fairly closed and do n't want to say the wrong thing , do n't want to offend another player , do n't want to cause problems . you seem to be pretty open-minded and pretty willing to express and say exactly what you think . does this get you in trouble at all ?
what 's your relationship with the serbians ? you mentioned those players . do you have relationship with the serbian players at all ?
i want to ask , seems like all the serbians have this kind of personality that you have , just very open , very engaging , very funny . why is that ? what 's in the water there ?

would you say your mental growth has been the biggest part of your game ?
has she paid the 20 ?
did you study a lot of caroline for this game ? because i feel she did n't study you , and i did n't see her father at your match . i was there in your matches , and i did n't see her father . her father is in the matches before she gon na play with you . what do you feel about ?
obviously she was an able opponent . she has a lot of variety and things in her game .

french and wimbledon are the two grand slams you have n't won . do you think there 's one or the other where you 'd have a better shot ?
when you think back to that capriati match , what do you think ? it 's a classic , kim .
china open is shooting a promotion film this week in miami . you agreed to be part of it , and they also said that you are very cooperative in shooting . does that mean you could still possibly play in october , or is it absolutely ...
does that mean if you come to beijing this october , you will come alone , no daughter ?
maria sharapova is in a similar situation , looking forward to playing in the first olympics , as you are . is there any concern that it might not feel like a real olympics because it 's going to be at wimbledon just a couple weeks later and might feel more like a second wimbledon that year ?
will you stay in the village ?
no , i mean , at wimbledon --
that would be three hours away .
how did it feel out there ?
are you looking forward to playing sam stosur next ?
what is it about your game that troubles her ? i do n't think she 's had a win over you so far .
you have had a bit of an up and down comeback since the shoulder surgery . are you starting to feel like now things are really coming together and you 're progressing and improving ?
do you feel like you 've found the right serve now that 's working with the shoulder and everything ? or are you still working ?
you recently changed racquet from prince to head .
did the shoulder issue contribute to that ?
the williams sisters are not playing this year . do you see that as an advantage maybe for the other women players ?
anything different about life for you now that you 're engaged ? are you starting to plan the wedding ? is that kind of fun ?

do you think like goals , do you say , gee , i want to want another grand slam title ? i want to do this or that , play the olympics since you did n't have a chance last time ?
you 're only 23. you 've won three grand slams . you 've here for so long they probably think you 're a lot older than what you are .
i 'm just curious , you 've grown up really here , you 've been here since you were ...
do you consider yourself more american ? russian ? obviously you do n't have an american passport .
it was a very quick match . what were you expecting coming in ? is it just good to get the first one over with ?
how was the shoulder ?
at the beginning are you tentative when you have an injury like that , or do you just dive right into the match ?
is there anything that you felt uncomfortable with in this match or something that you can improve upon ?
has jada been having fun ? what have you or what has she been doing ?
does she like the beach ?
i would imagine that you 're not thrilled with how you played today , although you had a nice win . do you think there was some of the fatigue left over from indian wells ?
was the key on your break points especially , holding those break points ? was that the key ?
what 's your fatigue level like after your two weeks in california ? obviously sunday you had that long match .
i think you play hantuchova next . she really played well today against melanie . what 's your history with her ?
what was the secret to dealing with bethanie 's power today ?
obviously very emphatic result . i would think you thought you played pretty well today .
again , conditions so different this week to indian wells . which do you prefer ?
do you feel you 're hitting it any better between indian wells and now ?
what about playing lucie safarova the next round ?
before you came here last year you were not a grand slam finalist . how different is your life as you head into these events that lead up to roland garros and the us open ?
but in your mind , are there moments where you 're finding yourself fighting against that ?
why do you love playing tennis ?
how are you feeling ?
when was the last time you played in miami ?
that 's what i thought . how does it feel to be back ?
how is your shoulder ?
are you healed ?
you are pretty popular in asia . can you talk a little bit about how you felt when you heard about the japan earthquake ?
where do you see yourself in the game right now ?
is it difficult , the pressure to be the first american player in action ?
what do you think went well for you today .
how do you prepare your match against caroline ?
players often do n't get to play the world no.1 , especially in their own country . how important will the crowd involvement be ?
she 's known for being one of the most mentally tough players on tour . is there a different way to play a match against someone who is so in it mentally ?
we hear that in flemish kim clijsters made a comment that she 'd be reluctant to go to japan because of the radiation , and maybe china . do you have any of those feelings ?
what do you recall from your last match against caroline in rome two years ago ?
what has she added to her game since then ?
how will you be celebrating ?
have you done that before ?
what about your emotions after this match , and if you can compare this great victory with wimbledon .
now maybe can you say that you 're the player of the year ?
so talk about your season and how you 've come so far just in terms of your game and maturity , everything .
can you compare in some way the two 5-love up you were up , with stosur and today , and something stopped . before you was flying away . anybody ca n't touch you . and then what happened ?
you said just now you were no.34 at the start of the year . did you have a target at the start of the year where you would like to finish in the rankings , for example ?
the no.1 ranking for the next year , is that something you could be ready to claim early next year ?
you finished the season with this cup , and now you are in the no.2 and you achieved this in the city . is istanbul gon na be special in your lifetime ?
you have won an awful lot of money this year , along with your titles . you 've got some time after fed cup to maybe spend some of it . what 's the plan ?
you have achieved so much this year . do you think that this success and becoming world no.2 is going to change how you 're viewed at home , take it up a step from having won a grand slam title ?
do you know if many people have been watching you here this week at home ?
i know you still have the fed cup to play , but what will you do after that between then and the start of next season ?
what were the main steps of your season to your mind ?
can you explain how important to you your coach has been this year and what he has helped you with , in particular ?
you 're no.2 now , and no.1 spot is really close , like 150 points or something like that . is it going to be a big motivation , or do you think it would turn into like pressure starting the next season ?
could i ask you about the noise you make after you win a point ? is that something you 've always done , or is your coach ...
yeah ? have you ever tried to stop it ?
the olympic games next year in london , do you want to represent your country there ?
yes .
what will be your goal ? i mean ...
how did you find the atmosphere in the tournament in istanbul ?
about the scream , which , i mean , i think is almost normal for me after so many screams we hear about sharapova and the others . it 's at the end of the shot , so looks like normal . but for you , what it means for you when you do that ? is it like your freedom , is it something you finish , is something you are happy ? why ? how you can explain that ?
do you have a feeling that you are something more , something different compared to the other players , i mean , something which can close every moment with a shot ? do you have this feeling or not ?
obviously having won wimbledon , having won here as well , does it give you sort of confidence and belief when you do go to the australian open in january that you can do okay there ?
how much do you think vika 's screams affect the game ?
coming back to what you want to do when this is finished , this year , wonderful year is finished , what do you like to do exactly ? i mean , going , traveling in some place you have seen this year ? going to beach ? going to mountains ? where ?
walk us through the match , your assessment . what was the difference ?
you played her closer than your last couple of times . did you try to do something differently this time around ?
( through translation . ) after 5-love , you brought the set back to 5-5. what were you thinking at 5-love , and what did you think at 5-all ?
what happened ? why did you start the game so bad ? what was the problem ?
no , you know , you do n't feel like , you know -- in the first five games you do n't feel confident , but then you fought back ? i mean , mentally problem or something different ? what was it ? you know , you do n't fit well in the first five games .
i asked you yesterday about the left-handed serve and whether it 's probably the most difficult serve in women 's tennis at the moment . it worked again pretty well today . can you talk a little bit more about the difficulties of facing it and what you have to do against it ?
for a while in women 's tennis we have been talking about when the next generation is going to come through , and there has been kim and serena still kind of hanging around . well , now tomorrow you , caroline , and petra will be the top three . do you see the three of you embedding yourself for the next three , four , five years ?
the game is unpredictable , but i want to ask you to make a prediction : would you expect petra to become no.1 soon ? i know you 're both going to be competing for it next year . how do you see it going ?
but if she was to reach no.1 , do you think she 'd be worthy of it ?
can we talk about noise made on court ?
no , i do n't want to talk about the noise you make on court , but a few years ago a lot of men 's players got upset about lleyton hewitt and the noises he made followed by the fist . now , every time she wins a big point or indeed you made an error , there was a crow-like screech and a fist , which i thought was rather undemeaning . do you have any thoughts on it at all ?
do you hear it ?
what 's next for holiday ? what 's your plan ?
any cooking lessons ?
now that the season is over , assess your season and also just assess this tournament for the first time .
and the tournament ?
first game of the third set you had your chances there . is that your one regret , that maybe you just could n't get ahead in the third ?
you say you 're going home tomorrow . is that to monte-carlo or is that to belarus or where ?
can you just tell us when -- i mean , is it a couple weeks ' holiday and then back to work ? what 's your timing going to be ?
where is the concert ?
how much did you feel that that match was on your racquet ?
then just three early breaks in all the sets , that was tough to overcome ?
well , in all three you were down a break pretty early .
did you feel like you made some progress , at least ? you won a set today . you got much closer than you have in the past .
could you assess your season now that it 's done , please .
is it harder to play against a left-handed opponent for you ?
what 's next for you , sort of the next couple of months ?
with what 's happening the last few months , would you almost want the season to continue or are you pretty much ready for that break ?
if petra wins tomorrow , she 's going to be no.2 , and she 'll be pretty close to caroline going into the new year . could you just compare and sort of contrast their respective games from a player 's perspective ?
of the maybe under 23 players that are out there right now , does she look to you , petra , like the one with the skill ? she can be erratic and she plays a high-risk game , but does she look like she has the skills that can really consolidate and be a solid no.1 player ?
the men are still talking about the length of their season . you were saying you feel pretty good at this stage . do you feel that 's a sign that the women have got it just about right in terms of length of the year ?
but looking back , do you think it was a tough decision for the women to make to cut the year ?
you 've obviously improved a lot in the course of the season . is there any part of your game you 're going to look at during the offseason to improve even more ?
what are you expecting when you get back ? you only had that four or five days after the us open . are you going to be bombarded with attention , do you think ?
what will you do in your down time ? sit up in your house and what else ?
are you planning to make sightseeing next couple of days ? are you excited to come back in next year in istanbul ?
your flight is not with qantas , is it ?
what was the key to the match in your opinion ?
in the first set you were up , and then you 're leading 40-love and there was an exchange at the net and you missed a very easy two backhand in the net . did something shift ? momentum ? did you lose your focus after that ?
a lot of your wins this year have been with you hitting lots of winners and playing so well . is it in some ways more satisfying to win like this , kind of a more ugly , grittier victory ?
is it more satisfying for you to win a tighter , harder match like this rather than controlling everything as you have done all year ?
to have so much power and to have so many weapons could be a problem for yourself mentally , because you always know you can come back in a match , you have always a chance and you have to work on this , do you think , first of all ?
what do you think you have to improve , in the defense maybe or what ? i mean , which do you think could be the most improvement for you ? you know , we talk about you becoming no.2 in the world . no.3 is already very good . but what do you think is the most improvement you have to do ? is it physically , mentally , on defense ?
how tight were you closing the match out ? 5-love , everything seemed straightforward , and then back she came again to 5-3. did you tighten up a little bit ?
in women 's tennis , many players prefer to play from baseline , but you like too much to approach to the net . is it possible to say that this difference make special success for players ?
who do you prefer to play against tomorrow ?
can you talk about the two opponents that you might play ?
you said you think you need to work on your fitness . is that something you will concentrate on in the offseason ? and i wonder what aspect of your fitness particularly do you think you need to work on ?
so i wonder , for example , would it be speed work , movement , or what particularly ?
when you think about volley , do you think of something you have to do , you will do , or you like to do ?
when you see yourself in the next two years , you see yourself someone who 's going more on the net or not ?
possible two victories in next week for you , the wta championship and the fed cup title . it is dream of the end of the season for you ?
what was your assessment of the key to that match ? it was a tough 6-2 , 6-3 , no ?
so no after-effects from the late match last night ?
you 've played petra five times . you 've lost to her the last three times including twice this year . what are you going to have to do differently this time to beat her ?
did you manage to see any of the first semifinal when you were warming up ? because she was either brilliant or she could n't get a ball in the court . there was n't a lot of in-between , really . is that the way she normally plays ?
is her left-handed serve the most difficult serve to play in women 's tennis at the moment ?
the no.2 ranking will be up for grabs also tomorrow . how much of that is an extra motivation going in ?
you are yet to win a slam , and you seem to still searching for a little spark . do you think winning this thing would give this spark to you for the next year , to win a slam ?
you are yet to win a slam at the moment .
and you seem to still searching for this little spark to inspire you to win a slam . do you think winning this thing would inspire you like amlie mauresmo ? 2005 she won the championships and then went on to win the australian open , the wimbledon .
well done . you 're in the semis . what do you want to say about the game ?
i saw your facebook page today . i saw you were at spice market yesterday .
how was it ?
does that show sort of further robustness you 've got like when you lost like you did to victoria only a couple nights ago and then you come out and completely turned it around ?
you 're 7 and 2 this year against top 5 players . what do you sort of put that down to ? obviously you 've really been able to perform against the really best players .
how does it feel , limping to the line or not even getting to the line really at the end of the season ? how physically drained do you feel and mentally , as well , i guess ?
just a question about the ranking system , actually . do you think it actually rewards players who win grand slams ? do you think it 's a true measure of who is actually the best player in the world at the moment , given caroline 's early departure here and the fact she still was n't won the grand slam ?
how much towards the mythic title of player of the year would winning this tournament go for whoever comes out on sunday , do you think ?
yeah . in a year of parity , how much would winning this title bolster sort of the mythic idea of player of the year , do you think ?
if you were to pick one now , who would you pick ?
at home , are you sensing every time you play now that people are hanging on your results more than they might have just a couple of months ago ?
but since the us open , is it exhilarated again ?
are you happy because of the sports from the stands ?
you played a few days now in front of some packed crowds . how do you think that reflects on turkey for the 2020 olympic bids ?
obviously the slams are above everything else , but how do you rate this sort of tournament , obviously potentially maybe winning it on sunday compared to obviously the grand slams ?
on-court coaching has been here for a while . do you find you 're cooling to it or warming to it ? where do you stand on that whole idea ?
is dave happy about never being called on ? can he get out there at any point ?
you 've never used it once ?
looks like you 're going to play the winner of petra and aga . can you talk a little bit about each of those matchups ?
going into this match , did you know that you had to just get a set ? at 5-1 was it kind of going through your mind ?
it 's the end of the season . you must be disappointed , but also you 've obviously started to play really well at the end . that must give you a lot of confidence going into next year .
what are your plans in the offseason now ?
was sam just a bit too strong out there today for you ?
do you feel that you lose confidence against sam because of the style of play that she does play ?
so it was n't your day . so what was going wrong ? it did n't look like many things were going right for you today .
it 's the end of your season .
maybe the first half was different than the second half . but talk about it a little bit . how do you feel about 2011 ?
do you think you will look for a new coach or have a new coach when we see you next year ?
but you 'll consider a new coach , or you 're not going to even think about it ?
you obviously have played sam quite a few times this year . have you noticed her improvement or anything different at all as the year has gone on and maybe particularly since she won the us open title ?
are you happy with your ability to come back in that first set today ?
you 've got samantha stosur up next in the semifinals . can you talk about that match a little bit , what you expect from it ?
what do you remember of your match against her at the australian open ? because at the time it was a big upset . does n't look like it 's a big upset now .
did you know that radwanska today needed only one set to qualify to semifinals ?
no ? now you know .
no , she needed only one set .
you played now a few days of the championships . what do you think about istanbul as a venue and the atmosphere out on the court ?
is it important for you to have won all three of your matches in the group ? is it good for self-confidence , extra ?
the question is if you would know that you are deciding the fate of zvonareva , would you think about it for a moment or you just play for yourself ?
how did you feel when you found out that you 'd get to actually play today as an alternate ?
did you notice at all when you were playing , you know , if victoria was feeling tired or something like that across the net ?
you 're off to bali next , i presume ?
so you 're in a new outfit today . are you in a new deal with lotto ?
congratulations .
also , you said you have n't been hitting . what have you been doing in istanbul ?
the handshake at the end was quite frosty . is she always like that ?
it 's nice to see you here after moscow kremlin cup . i know you intended to paint red square . you did it or maybe you will paint something in istanbul ?
you have been in istanbul now as a spectator and as a player . do you think istanbul is a good location for bidding for the 2020 olympics ? do you think they have proven themselves to be capable of doing this ?
what do you think ? who will be winner here in istanbul ?
azarenka/zvonareva and stosur/kvitova .
looking at the field , and obviously you have been here , you know , seeing the top 8 over the course of the year , who do you look at as becoming the one who had maybe the best 2011 ? there 's been so much parity and different people winning slams and things like that .
i like the way you behave on the court , but vika , she was like stressed about it when you were like doing like warmup or something before serving . did you feel it , or like you did n't care about it ?
so it 's her problem , not yours , that she was stressed or feel not fine about it ?
( through translation . ) you have lost a match which you almost won . at what point do you think , crucial point , do you think the match turned around and changed ?
( through translation . ) did it make you nervous at any time in the match that every ball you shot at radwanska somehow came back ?
you played radwanska four times this year . you lost all the matches . why ?
but last four matches you lost with radwanska .
( through translation . ) during the third set , around 5-3 or 5-4 when you were on the break , you turned to your coach , i think it was your coach , and said something . what is it you said ?
you played as though you might have been unwell or something . was that in fact the case ?
did the trainer take your blood pressure , or what was she doing ?
so is that the result of just sort of a long , hard season , or have you caught a bug or what is it ?
you obviously had a late night last night . do you think you would have benefited from having had a day off today and played your last match tomorrow ?
kvitova started the year outside the top 30 and now she 's world no.3 . what do you think of her and her game ?
and you mentioned you 're going to have a rest . do you have any specific plans for holiday or ...
what would you rate your body , the way you feel today ? was it like 30 % ? 50 % ? i mean , where is your health level ?
when did you not start feeling 100 % ? was it today ?
and some players seem to be built for indoor tennis . is she one of those players ? without the wind and the sun , some players can find their groove easier than others .
you started off the year really well winning dubai , charleston , and so on . but the second half of your year has been much less good . what would you say that 's due to ?
on djokovic , he tweeted you yesterday , congratulating you on your world no.1 ranking . do you talk to him a lot ? do you see each other much when you are in monaco ?
you have a mathematical possibility that you could still qualify and make the semifinals . what are you going to do over the course of the next 24 hours ? just focus on that ? it 's kind of a weird situation to be in at a tennis tournament to kind of wait around to see if you 're in the next round .
earlier you said that you like playing indoors , but over the last couple of years the wta has kind of moved a lot of the indoor courts in the space of beijing and tokyo . do you miss those big tournaments indoors like zurich and all of those ?
regardless of whether you 're eliminated or not , you 're planning a couple of days in istanbul . can you go a little further on that ? have you got any commitments with turkish airlines , for instance ?
yeah .
any idea of what you might be able to do on your other istanbul days ?
have you talked much with the others about istanbul 's legendary market and bartering for stuff ? is that something you might be interested in doing if you feel well enough ?
victoria said you brought her monaco residence card here with you . can you tell the story behind that ?
is it normal that you could bring that to someone ? they do n't have to pick it up themselves ?
could we have your view about the match you just played ?
your view , your thoughts about the match you just finished .
well done . great game . what do you think about the atmosphere in istanbul and the audience of turkish tennis game ?
( through translation . ) what was the most important part of the match which was a crucial turning point for you ?
i 'm not sure , but i think one set will be enough for you advancing for semifinals tomorrow . what do you think about the game tomorrow ?
( through translation . ) how is the injury on your shoulder ?
with obviously tonight 's result , that obviously puts quite a bit of pressure and expectation on your next match against samantha tomorrow . i 'm just wondering how you see that .
how did you feel your level was today and her level ?
your coach came out a few times . are you using on-court coaching now more than you used to in the past ?
does he always talk to you about tactics on the court , or does he say , like , what are you we going to have for dinner tonight ?
so are you saying that you would rather that in the wta coaches did n't come onto the court and just players get on with it like they always used to ?
you like having a coach come on court , then , do you ?
you do n't have a great record against sam . how do you think you can overturn that tomorrow night ?
she makes a lot of noise when she hits the ball . does this bother you when you 're playing ?
do you think the tour should do something about loud players ?
but on the tennis court you could tell them not to do something . maybe not sleeping , but on the tennis court you could tell them .
if you were voting on a player of the year for the wta , who would you pick , including yourself ?
maria ?
obviously she was maybe ailing a little bit , but talk about your level just today and the other day . you seemed to be very confident and moving well .
it 's been about a year -- you did n't play her this year at all , so do you feel like you 've become a much more dangerous player than the last time you played her ?
turkish fans have different cycle , as you know . it 's very difficult to win this sport . today you manage to win them . how did you do it ? they supported you against ...
was it any more motivation today to play caroline ? you know , you 're 21 years old and you won a slam . she 's 21 and she 's no.1 . were you extra excited to play today ?
did you notice , before she took the timeout with the doctor , did you notice that she was n't feeling well ?
you obviously started the year outside of the top 30 , and now you 're no.3 and in the semifinals of this tournament . did you expect to have done this well so quickly ?
and also , obviously about wozniacki and being no.1 , is that a big goal for you , to be no.1 ? or would you say you 'd rather win a grand slam ?
so your coach came out . what do you think of on-court coaching ? do you like it ? are you using it more than you used to ?
do you find yourself at a grand slam thinking like , oh , i want to call my coach out , but , oh , i ca n't ?
never ?
if you were to pick the top women 's player , the player of the year this year , including yourself , who would you pick ?
no one 's really won the season so much better than everyone else , right ?
you know , you obviously won wimbledon and you 're no.3 now . you could end the tournament at no.2 . do you ever find yourself having to convince yourself that you 're that good , or are you slowly believing it or do you already believe it ?
you 're already advanced to the semifinals , so in your next match , what 's your strategy going in ? i mean , for you , it does n't matter the result really , so what 's your strategy ?
obviously this tournament you get like 100,000 every match . are you planning on buying anything special with your prize money ?
you seem to be playing with a lot of confidence , serving well . also , your defense looks particularly good . can you talk about all those things ?
some of the players have said the surface is a little bit funny or funky . do you like it ? does it suit your game ?
you talked a little bit about your preparation in luxembourg . was there any point where you thought once you had qualified that you would go ahead and skip that tournament and just head straight here ? or did you feel like you needed the match play heading into the championships ?
you seemed very emotional after the game , very pumped up .
what exactly were the thoughts going through your mind ? what was the reason why you were so pumped up ?
there was nothing more than just this win , everything that comes with that win ? because you achieve a lot now this week already ?
with this win i think you 're already through to the semifinals . how do you approach your next match ? are you going to try and keep it a bit more chilled and not aggravate certain things like your body , or will you go out and play 100 % ?
clearly this place suits you , two wins , two matches , but it 's a new venture for the wta . it 's a new venue and everything . what was your take on how it 's working here in istanbul ? the crowds are good .
was it a little bit of a letdown in doha ? because there you were top eight , end-of-year championships , and sometimes the crowds were sparse , were n't they ?
going back to the celebration and your kind of outbursts at the end , you put your tongue out , you swirl your fingers . is that a completely spontaneous thing ? is that an inside joke with your coach ? where did that come from ?
i think you did it first in miami maybe ?
you used a lot of topspin today when you hit your forehand . is that your strategy coming into today 's match ? can you talk about how do you think li played today ?
you have so much momentum in the moment . is it a case almost wanting the season to go on a bit longer ?
when you 're in the form that you 're in at the moment , does part of you think that you 're going to have a break for a couple of months and then kind of piquing out for the beginning again next year ?
do you worry you might lose some of the edge , some of the kind of sharpness ?
can you rate your confidence level right now versus , say , this spring ?
well , do you feel as good as you did back then right now , or you 're not playing at that level ?
did you get a chance to talk to caroline about the comments that she made about players that make noise on court ?
it was a tough game against wozniacki . can you tell us your performance ? i mean , yesterday and today , can you compare it on the court ?
you seem pretty kind of -- you did n't seem to kind of believe in yourself yesterday , but today you seemed to be hitting winners all over the court . where did all that confidence come from ?
is it difficult for you to play every day game ? you 'll play again tomorrow ?
congratulations .
i have a question : what 's more important right now , this or what happened on the court ?
so you knew before going on court that you were ...
oh , you did n't ?
are you feeling tired right now ? i mean , yesterday , today , and tomorrow you 'll have a game ?
actually we do n't usually see tennis games like this in istanbul . so what do you think about the audience and the turkish supporters ?
when pete sampras retired , one of the things that he pushed for was to finish year-end world no.1 . i think it was six times . do you think it 's something that people do n't really look at and sort of recognize the true importance of ?
i guess that was a bit of a leveler after the excitement of maria last night ?
were you feeling a sluggish after a late finish last night ? did that have anything to do with it ?
how do you characterize the speed of this court ?
do you know if you have a day off tomorrow or what the plan is ?
how do you sort of get yourself back together to play li na in the next match ?
you were obviously were involved in a well-documented incident in the us open final with serena . how much more difficult is it when a player shouts out , come on , sort of as you 're trying to lunge for the ball than when you 're playing someone who is making a noise after each shot , as is always the case with this opponent today ?
is there a difference with players like victoria , if you were to watch her back on tv , do you hear it more then ?
what does it sound like to you ?
in general , though , wozniacki said the other day it 's a form in cheating in some ways , she thinks , if players are doing it deliberately , which she thinks some of them are . would you agree with that ?
do you think they are ?
can i just ask a little bit about li . you 've got obviously a good record against her relative to the other two you 've played in the group . how does your game match up well against hers ?
just with the noisemaking , do you feel like it 's gotten to a point where it 's gone too far , or do you think it 's acceptable with where it is right now ?
you do n't feel like the tour leadership needs to step in and do something about it at this point ? it 's just the way it is ?
we just got word that you 're withdrawing from the tournament . can you talk about the injury and all that ?
any regrets about trying to play here ?
obviously probably not how you wanted to end the season , but can you just characterize how the season has gone for you ? and also talk about -- i think caroline has probably wrapped up the no.1 ranking for the second year in a row as a result of your withdrawal .
and caroline ?
when are we likely to see you again on court ? what 's your sort of pre-australia plan ?
was that pretty much the start you wanted ? it seemed pretty smooth .
how would you describe the way the court is playing , speed-wise and bounce-wise ?
how did you feel yourself after a hard week , after last week ?
what was the plan for this match from your side ?
yes .
i know this has come up before , but caroline wozniacki has said a few things about the noise that people like yourself and maria make . she says that some players do it deliberately , and she wishes they would stop . has the tour mentioned this to you , anyone from seniority spoken to you about this issue ?
so short of a rule being brought in , that 's gon na be how it 's gon na be for you ?
but what if an opponent made a complaint , which they are within their rights to do ? then what would be your attitude to that ?
if you had to stop doing it , could you do it ?
really ?
can you just talk about the match and also your shoulder that was bothering you and about your serve .
she 's beaten you on clay but not on hard . what about indoors ? different kind of ball that comes off of her racquet ?
you were talking about the court speed . how is the court playing ?
you look a little tired . what do you think about your conditions in the end of this season ?
do you feel that time for the rest enough , like now , and no need tomorrow time for rest between the seasons ?
i mean like should it to be more time for rest before season or it 's enough ?
( through translation . ) how did you find the atmosphere and spectators tonight ?
( through translation . ) i would like to refer to the second set when you seemed like you were caught off-balance and you seemed to almost slip three times . does this have anything to do with your shoulder injury or the fact of the choice of shoes you had for today ?
you played in la . did you play in madrid ?
but you played in doha . you talked about the atmosphere . can you compare the venues , what they 're like a little bit from your memories ?
obviously the good thing about this event is you obviously have two matches left or maybe more . obviously wozniacki and radwanska are two different players to kvitova . how are you going to approach that match ?
usually when you play a tennis match and you lose in a tournament , you 're out of the tournament .
here the situation is different . you 're obviously not down like you would be if you would have been out in another tournament . do you like this formula , and would you like to see maybe more tournaments during the year with , you know , guarantees of a minimum number of matches for you during a week ?
that was a battle out there , huh ?
is that becoming more of a trademark of yours , just being able to put the past behind you , fighting it and gutting it out ?
what was your dad telling you ? he came out several times .
so dictate more ?
stacey yesterday spoke a little bit about the idea of the women 's tournament and the men 's year-ender all taking place at the same time possibly in the future . what would you think about that ? would you support that ? or do you think the women should stay separate ?
you do n't think it would detract from the women 's tour at all ?
so how would you compare this venue to doha where you 've also played ? can you describe how it 's different or not ?
the court surface , it 's i guess kind of slow or sticky ? how would you describe it ?
in your mind , what was the difference in the match today ? obviously you came back in the third set . what was the key to the match today , the win ?
it was n't your prettiest victory but it must have been one of your most satisfying ?
it was spectacular . you did n't hit winners from everywhere and did n't hit 20 aces or anything .
how big was the mental hurdle going in , given what had happened before ?
was tonight a bit about you showing another way to win in some ways ?
your movement , do you feel the last few months you 've really been able to sort of go to another level ? just seems defensively and just your movement seems to be somewhere else compared to where it was .
how important is it to have been through a tournament before ? it 's kind of unique , the round robin , only eight players . you have got to be sort of able to go from the first match . it 's a confined bubble of people that 's different than a normal tournament .
the crowd here was excellent for day one , and we look back at doha and remember a lot of empty seats certainly the start of the week . what was your take on it all ?
are you a bit surprised to be called on to play first tomorrow , given you were last tonight and you 're playing someone who has n't played at all yet ?
you 've got vika tomorrow , another player you have n't beaten . so talk about that match going into it , especially in light of what happened today .
obviously it was only last month that you had your major breakthrough , but how high do you sort of consider tonight 's win compared to other victories of the past ?
regarding tomorrow 's match , she has n't played yet or she will not have played yet . you 'll have one match . is that a disadvantage for you or advantage ? she 'll be fresher but you 'll have court sensations ? or i do n't know .
would you rather be in your place or hers ?
it had been probably about a month since your last match . did it take you some time to get into the rhythm of the match ?
you had had such a good record against sam in the past with nine in a row . what do you think she did better tonight than in the past , or perversely what you did n't do so well ?
how did you feel your own movement was in the match ? and the court i guess is kind of sticky to begin with .
are you having to make adjustments because of the ankle and , you know , going for more or changing your strategy at all ?
do you think physically you 're okay to play tomorrow 's match against li ? what 's your approach to that match ?
i think you mentioned already sam played with probably a bit more tactical nous than she might have done in the past against you . is that fair to say ?
when did you actually make the call to play here ? when did you give it the green light ?
and what sort of court time and physical training time have you been able to put in in the last month ?
yeah , since the injury .
how long are you staying in istanbul , the longest your stay in istanbul ? this time or some other ?
how do you like istanbul ?
how was the first day , tuesday atmosphere here , compared to the other championships you have appeared in ?
can you talk about the condition of the court ? do you think it has something to did with your loss today ?
the court . agnieszka said it 's pretty slow . it 's hard for her to , you know , keep the ball around , to hit the ball . i just want to know how you feel .
stacey mentioned yesterday that she would quite like to possibly see the women 's year-ender and the men 's year-ender taking place at the same time . have you got any thoughts or preferences on that ?
just in general , you have been working with thomas hogstedt for almost a year now . how is your collaboration ? is it kind of both of you working together ? are you the boss ? is he the boss ? how does it work ?
were you surprised sam could turn it around ? because sam is supposed to have some kind of a mental hurdle against you . after 3-love down she managed to get back . and how crucial was that fourth game where you had some chances ?
it 's a tough loss , but it 's not like a real loss in a tournament because you 're not out . you still have two more matches to play . so we saw vera before , and she did n't seem as down as you guys usually seem when you lose a match in a tournament . what state of mind are you in right now ? are you very , very disappointed like you would be normally , or because of the round robin you feel a bit different or you 're not sure ?
tell me about your shoulder . what 's the latest ?
you had your chances in that match , so what was the difference ? can you just talk about caroline 's mental toughness ?
is it tough to play a friend ?
on the surface , it 's described as rebound ace , which is the same as australia , but does it play anything like australia , this court ?
yeah .
nothing like that ?
when you guys shook hands at the end of the match , it was almost like a little conversation that lasted a long time . what did you guys say to each other ?
or read lips ?
on her game , i mean , she 's consistent , but mentally do you feel like she 's one of the best competitors out there ?
vera said you basically outplayed her today . do you feel the same way , even though you had that little sort of hiccup in the second set ?
clearly you like playing indoors . what is it about indoor conditions that you think are good for your game ?
how crucial was it to break her in the second set 4-all ? because she was gaining a little bit of momentum , breaking you twice . and last time you guys played in tokyo , she managed to come back from 5-1 down , and she won the first set and then you know the scoreline .
obviously you 're wimbledon champion , but at the same time you seem to talk quite a bit about getting nervous during times , and on court you said you were nervous before today 's match and then you were nervous during the match . i mean , can you talk about that a little bit , about why you 're getting so nervous in these moments ?
you probably do n't play many round robins , so as you go into the next part of this , how are you approaching this part of the tournament , the round robin ?
how is it to play the first round where you 're playing someone who is in the top 10 ? it 's not usual when you come to a tournament , right ? maybe that 's why you were nervous .
similar point , which is that do you feel at this time last year you were ranked sort of in the top 30 and now you 're the world no.3 and people were expecting you to win today . do you feel the pressure ?
what do you think about the group ? because the next two opponents of you kind of similar to vera . they are both counter-punchers like in your group , vera , agnieszka and caroline , but you are the one , big hitter . what do you think about group ?
obviously caroline is the world no.1 and you 're a grand slam champion . you 're the same age . people want to pit you against each other . is that the case off court ? are you friendly with her off court ?
is this a bit surreal , the emphatic nature of it all and how quickly it went and everything else ? how do you describe it ?
on behalf of australia , congratulations , first of all .
you were up against quite a formidable opponent . how did you rate your chances coming into today ?
obviously there was the controversy about the call . it was a big moment in the match . from your perspective , you know , there is some latitude in the hindrance rule . did you feel like she made , the umpire made the proper call ?
did you feel it was a ball you could have possibly returned ?
if you can share your thoughts , did you ever feel it was coming a bit more easily than you expected , and how did you handle not succumbing to that ?
those thoughts were running through your mind ?
just like a club player , thinking ahead ?
when can you remember playing as complete a match and as good a match as you played today ?
what aspects of the match do you think were decisive , technically speaking ?
technically , tactically .
your favorite shot being the inside out forehand .
with the unusual way that started the second set , first game of the second set ended and serena arguing about it , was it tough to stay focused during that ? did you lapse a little at all there ?
you 're a real tour professional and a veteran , yet people still talk about serena and a certain presence or ferocity , intimidation even in some cases . just talk about her presence and how she 's different from other players .
you said after beating petrova in round 3 that you were so proud because you had n't been known for your competitiveness on the court . do you feel like you dispelled the doubt today ?
do you think this will dictate now , what you did today , how you 'll play from now on ?
how was that for you , winning your first slam and also breaking australia 's drought like that ?
there was a time when your results in doubles were so good you virtually were a doubles player , and then you rededicated yourself when came back . do you think this was a possibility , or you just wanted to see what you could do ? talk about that decision and how it 's obviously come to fruition .
you were out of the game so long with that illness . did you ever give up on that dream ?
congratulations . yesterday you talked about 10 years ago at this time you were in japan playing like 10,000 tournaments . at that time , were you expecting to win the slams some day or like in 10 years ?
this victory puts you in a different dimension . expectations will be higher , especially in australia . how do you think you will handle the pressure approaching the australian open , because you will be the first australian after margaret court winning back-to-back the australian open and us open titles 40 years ago .
i know a lot has been made of your mental strength coming through . i know you 've been working diligently on the backhand and then coming to net . look like finally at this tournament those two things held up very well . talk about that , the backhand and the volley . you 've always had the serve and forehand , but the backhand held up pretty well . in the tournament you seemed a lot more confident at the net , too .
you talked about going back , watching some of this match on tv where she was playing wozniacki and she was totally intimidating . did you watch it , and were you a bit daunted by it ?
serena had quite a domineering run to the final ; for you , there was a lot of scratching , a lot of clawing , a lot of fighting to get there . as a result , you know , a lot of people picked her to win . in a way , those hard battles you had to go through , do you think that in a way you drew confidence from the fact that you 've been able to have your back against the wall the way you have and fought and scratches and so forth . a , did that give you confidence ? and b , if you can just kind of reflect back on not only today 's match , but also on the tournament and what you 've learned about yourself .
were you thinking about that going into today 's match ? i mean , you know , up against such a formidable opponent , is that something that you were drawing upon ?
shortly after the match serena came over and sat down next to you in the chair . were you surprised she did that ? looked like you were having a friendly chat . what were you talking about ?
was it difficult for you to accept the fact that you had n't won more than two tournaments until today , even if you 're such a good player you had beaten most of them or maybe all of them ?
can you tell us who 's with you and what reaction you 've had from back home ?
the australian tradition obviously is a great story . i 'd like you to talk about in terms of respect , the code of conduct , is that important in today 's game , or is it more of just a matter of winning at whatever costs , getting the ws and prevailing ?
as part of the australian tradition , what are your thoughts on that ?
you had a tough first three months of the year through march , through miami . the results were n't really there . was there one key moment in april or may when you kind of flipped a switch , got confident again , and said , yeah , my game is back again ?
reflect on the sacrifices you 've had to make personally and your family had to make , especially during those teenage years maybe when you 're sleeping on couches , that every professional athlete has to do along the way .
i 'd like to go back to the second set . did you understand what was going on ?
it seemed like the umpire would have brought in rule 26 regardless , the harassment rule .
did you know it was ...
you spoke about the importance of your team , and you also spoke about watching pat rafter 's win and jumping into the stands when you were a teenager . describe today blow by blow as you go up to the box and celebrate with that team .
i think the start of the year you were working with ruth anderson on the psychological .
has that been ongoing all year ? how has that been ?
was there one kind of hard truth that came out of all that that you had to confront and get over ?
what was your take-away from all those tough conversations after charleston ? what emerged ?
which train stations did you sleep ?
how many nights ?
angelique talked a little bit about how the first few games went too fast for her . did you sense that , or was that a strategy of yours , maybe take advantage of your experience ?
what were you telling yourself before the start of the third set ? you put yourself into so much adversity already this tournament , and it felt like you were just doing it to yourself again .
you have been out on the court a lot of hours at this tournament . does it sort of feel that way ? going for the semifinals is a long run anyway , but does it feel like even more than that many matches ?
how did you feel about playing the semifinal on a grandstand court of a major ?
do you think your opponent will have a significant disadvantage ? they have n't gone on yet . if it was flipped , would you feel a little bit of a disadvantage if you were in that scenario ?
did it feel like it took away from the semifinal atmosphere compared to your previous experiences at this level ?
what would a grand slam victory mean for you ?
tomorrow is the 10-year anniversary of 9/11 . it 's a major final , but how much does that add to it , particularly if serena is in the final ?
if you do play serena , that will be more than a grand slam final , though , would n't it , at the us open , new york , 9/11 , 10th anniversary ?
you have been through so much , sort of a doubles to singles swing , so to speak , serious injury , the setback in the roland garros final , some struggles since . what would it mean to samantha stosur to hold up the us open trophy tomorrow ?
do you have any memories of patrick 's wins here ?
what were you doing 10 years ago on 9/11 when the attacks happened here ?
when you lost the french open final , did you think , i 'll definitely have another chance ? next time i 'll get it ? did you worry maybe this is my one chance at this point in my career ?
it 's been 31 years since the last major champion from australia . do you think about what it would mean for australia ?
you 've had victories against williams and wozniacki in your career . how do you approach tomorrow ? can you address facing each of them and what is your confidence level ?
you 're a great professional , known for your hard work . you make this incredible run at roland garros , and then , then let 's face it , a really devastating defeat . as a professional athlete , what is your take-away lesson from that ?
you mentioned a number of people had said you will get another shot . have there been any particular words that have gotten through to you from any one individual that made you sort of think , you know ...
i think you 're gon na watch the match with serena and caroline 's match . when you watch the match , do you have any specific point you 're going to pay attention and try and analyze ?
you 've spoken a bit about what it means to be in the final and what it would mean to win . what does it mean to you to also be in the company of margaret court , evonne , wendy , the only australian women to reach this final in the open era ?
the idea of proving a no.1 by winning a slam title , that monkey on her back , do you think it 's deserved or do you think it 's unfair ?
from a business point of view , a lot of americans probably never have heard of you until this year . how important is winning this title ? it 's become a household name for endorsement and business opportunities .
she jumped on you pretty early there . was that a big experience for you , just being in your biggest match ?
you talked about the people and the lights . were you happy when you heard that you would be playing on grandstand instead of ashe ?
you said there was nothing you could do . i mean , the men players stepped up and talked to the usta and got a day off . do you think the women need to step up ?
what 's next for you now that you 've reached a semifinal at the slam ? what are your goals for the rest of the year ?
how do you know if this is one good run for you or the beginning of you stepping up and becoming more of a challenger ?
what are your expectations now in terms of challenging next year ? what do you think you 're capable of ?
what would you say is either your best surface or your favorite surface ?
did you have family here with you ?
i saw someone with a big bouquet of roses . were those for you ?
someone supporting you . they had roses . for you ?
if you could first of all just assess the way you played today .
can you talk about what it was like to play out there ? when is the last time you played in a court like that ?
do you have any disappointment at all though that you 're the no.1 seed here and you 're on court 13 ?
do you have any thoughts on the schedule change ? looks like the semis will be saturday night and the finals sunday . do you like that ?
did you like the intimacy of having the crowd on top of you and loud and sort of like a junior match from years ago ?
i know you were kind of young when 9/11 happened . do you have any memories of your experience and where you were when that happened ?
here in new york ?
with the schedule changes , you might be playing that final match on 9/11 . talk about the poignancy of going out in a new york showcase theater and playing on the 10-year anniversary of 9/11 .
i know that . let 's just say that you do .
you played serena twice , and the first time in sydney 2009 before you became sort of a big player ; i think it was 7-6 in the third . can you talk about your memories of what you thought about going on court against like a great champion , and then just the match and how intense it was and all that .
this is the first time you 're playing her since you were no.1 . there has been so many questions about your rise . do you think you can answer a lot of questions in that match on saturday ?
she was asked in her press conference about an hour ago what she thought your greatest strength was , and she said the fact that you just never give up . talk about that quality in yourself , and also if you could assess what you think her greatest strengths are .
do you consider her a role model in any way ?
you have often said you like big challenges . going out saturday night for you , given your status and how well you 're playing , it is a huge challenge , no ?
you , of course , are well known for interviewing caroline wozniacki . if you had to ask wozniacki one question after her run at new haven and here in new york on the eve of these big matches coming up , what could you come up with ?
what are you going to see tomorrow at the movies ?
this movie , the devil 's double , about saddam hussein 's son is pretty intense .
bridesmaids .
you have always been popular in europe . you 're gaining much popularity here in the states . you like a good laugh . you give everybody a good laugh . what 's it mean to you to gain this popularity in this country ?
can you be yourself at no.1 ? is it tougher to be yourself at no.1 than it would be at a lower rank ?
what was the problem with both of you guys holding serve to start the match ? that was just weird . was it the rain , not being outside for a couple of days ?
what turned it around for you then ?
what have the last two days been like for you ? what did you do ? where did you practice ? how did you kill time ?
what 's she like to play ? what 's her game like ? did it take you a set to get used to just the way she hit the ball , how hard she hit it ?
you 've won 13 slams and have had lots of slam experience . in these tournaments , these big tournaments , do you get a feeling that , hey , i 'm on a real roll here , i could go all the way ? is that something you feel inside yourself as part of the process ?
they moved the roddick match because of a bubbly court out to 13. have you played out there ? what 's it like on the outside courts ? i guess you have n't played for years there now .
with the anniversary of 9/11 coming up , can you talk about your memories of that , and where you were at the time when that happened 10 years ago ?
what are your thoughts on caroline 's style of play and what has made her so effective in attaining the no.1 ranking ?
what are her weapons ? that 's always been the knock , that she does n't have the weapons to win a slam . in your estimation , what weapons does she have ?
how do you stay so mentally tough ? knowing you were down , and you had to turn the match around , how do you stay so mentally tough and so focused ?
just have it . okay . is your game a lot better than it was when you started the summer at stanford ? how would you evaluate the progress you made since you started hard courts after wimbledon ?
earlier in the year you were asked , why do you hope you 're -- why are you going to be playing well ? and you said , well , i need the money . you could win a heck of a lot of money here . you could win 2.8 million . what do you do with that kind of money ?
within the last year , because of injury and health , this was almost taken away from you . you got it back . what 's that mean to you ?
you say you keep learning from these experiences . what have you learned from this very last one ?
is that why you wear t-shirts now that have holes in them , to make up for the fact that you ca n't wear shoes that have ...
are you able to play without thinking at all about the injuries or illness ?
with the nfl season starting tonight and you being such a follower , you go to so many games , who do you think will make it to the super bowl and who do you think will win ?
what would mean to you more , a dolphins super bowl title or us open title for serena ?
did the former usta official , arlen kantarian , who is an advisor for the dolphins , have any role with your becoming involved with the dolphins ?
how ready are you to get into that broadcast booth and start calling a football game ? you sound as if you could do it tomorrow .
there were some who were wondering if you were being paid by the hour in the third and fourth , round but today it must have been a relief just to get that match over .
vera has been playing some great tennis . obviously it shows in her ranking . you have dominated her the last eight times that you 've played her . what is it about the way you two match up that enables you to get the best of her consistently ?
she said that she felt that you felt comfortable against her because of the way she plays her game . is that so ?
obviously the job is not done yet . what does it mean to you ? what does it feel like to be in the semis of the open for the first time and the first australian queenslander since wendy in '84 ?
can you talk a little bit about the rain delay and what you did and what mentally you had to do to stay focused .
rafa came in earlier today and said that he felt that the players are not considered more in the decision-making here at the us open . do you have any thoughts on that ?
do you think it 's also a situation with the way the scheduling is done with this tournament , in that you 've got first round across three days rather than two at most slams -- french starts on a sunday , anyway .
and then it 's more evenly spread , so you probably would have had the quarters done by now .
what are your thoughts on that ?
how intense is that playing day after day after day ? usually just semis and finals , but now you have quarters , semis , finals . i guess it 's less of an adjustment for the women because you probably do this during the year . is very intense to do it at a slam ?
can you look ahead to first playing kerber and then separately to playing pennetta ?
you said after beating kirilenko that you felt more pumped than ever in your life . how did you feel today ?
i think you played flavia in fed cup . is that the last time you played ?
can you talk about how you 're feeling about your game now compared to then ?
is this some of the best tennis you 've played since your run at the french ?
that run you went on at the end of the first set and then the first two games in the second , was that almost as close as it gets to perfect , 12 straight points in a row ?
with the anniversary of 9/11 coming up , can you talk a little bit about your memories that you have and where you were and what that experience was like for you ?
a tough match ?
but why were you asleep ?
do you think caroline has a chance against serena in the semifinal ?
with this match , you had an opponent that you only played the one time and it was on clay . going in , did you feel that it was still a mystery what she was gon na bring to the table ? did she do anything today maybe that frustrated you ?
neither woman really had a chance . it seemed nobody was establishing their serve very well . both of you guys were having a tough time serving . is there any reason behind that ?
this is your third quarterfinal here , and i know that you had a really good week here . you beat sharapova . i mean , are you gon na walk away thinking this was a success , or is it something where you feel you have more and you can get to the semis and potentially a final here ?
you beat zvonareva here two years ago . is this your favorite slam to play in ?
is she a tricky matchup , left hander going forward against stosur , as well ? is she hard to play on this surface because she 's a lefty ?
i know that you go into every match thinking you 're going to win . that 's how every tennis player is . but are you surprised yourself that you got this far , a semifinal at the us open ?
how do you explain it ?
andrea petkovic helped you out , did she ?
how did she help you ?
was today your best match at this tournament , or you play better versus radwanska who is a good friend of yours ?
what is your training situation in germany ? do you have a coach that you travel with full-time ? where do you practice in the country ?
what does a week like this do for you as far as the tournaments that you were planning to play ? you 're going to go from 92 to 32 no matter what happens . were there challengers you were planing to play that you will pull out of now and try to enter bigger events in the fall ?
how do you like being in new york ?
can you talk about playing stosur .
at the beginning of the year , if someone came up to you and said , hey , guess what ? you 're gon na make it to the open semis , what would you say ?
how much has it helped you with obviously girls like andrea , julia doing so well , and sabine , of course ?
you said this was like a dream . do you ever say to yourself , hey , is this for real ? does it ever have a little sense of maybe a dream-like quality for you ? could you talk about that ?
when you played flavia earlier this year , earlier this summer on clay , what did you learn from that match that you took into this match today ?
how do you explain that you were 4-2 in the second set and you lose six games , almost seven , because she had the point to go 3-nil ? what happens ?
how do these women go up and down like that ?
you had a pretty vocal group cheering you on . what was sort of like your feelings about them ? they really seemed to get into every point that you were going on . do you like the crowd support here ?
are they just fans or family ? i just was n't sure . did you know them ?
have you played on ashe before ?
is that gon na help you ? are you going to be nervous , you think ?
we have to ask every single german player about her relationship with steffi . could you talk about that ? was she an inspiration ? have you spoken to her recently ?
how do you think this run here at the us open will change your life ? you 're going to be getting tremendous attention in the semis .
your parents are polish , right ?
caroline is a good friend of yours , right ? can you talk about a little bit the relationship between you and caroline .
have you checked your phone yet ? how many smss have you gotten from friends ?
one month ago i ask petkovic at the tournament at carlsbad , what happened with kerber ? her ranking drop down so far . she said , do n't worry , she will soon be in 30s . do you know how much you will improve after the tournament in the ranking ?
how would you describe the challenge that you had out there today playing ?
after the success you had this summer , how has your play here so far matched your expectations coming in ?
what have you been most satisfied with ?
how funky was it out there ?
unlike any other stadium ?
a lot of players talk about rankings . do you worry about that , that this is the us open ?
still , a few years ago during the european circuit when another player was no.1 , you said , hey , we all know who the no.1 player in the world is . do you think we have the situation like that where you are the best player in the world now ?
how well do you know spike lee ?
does he play at all ?
being no.1 , was that a specific goal of yours or was it win all the tournaments and the ranking will follow ?
favorite spike lee movie ?
the first point of the match you won with an ace . the second point she ripped that service return for a winner . did that kind of wake you up ?
did the loss to bartoli at wimbledon , has that served as a special kind of motivation ?
you talked about titles . there 's still two players that have more singles titles than you . does that motivate you ?
yes .
it does n't appear that there 's any facet of your game that needs work at the moment . you do n't seem to have a weakness right now . in your mind , is there anything in particular you want to see improve ?
is it you felt like you could hit a particular stroke a lot better or competed generically better ?
back to spike lee , what is he like on court when he 's hitting a tennis ball ?
can he be as funny in person as he is on the screen ?
ana said you were intimidating . do you try to be intimidating out there ?
what happens in that karaoke room ? do you go in and sing yourself ?
new stuff , old stuff ?
is there video of you doing this ?
you keep saying you 're happy to be here . at what point in the second week do you only get happy if you win ?
you talked a moment ago about your movement . when did you feel that was starting to kick in for you since you came back in june ?
do you feel like you 're moving as well as you were a year ago at this point ?
what are the keys to your serve and how would you describe it as a weapon in your game ?
how do you do it ?
when you see footage of your own serve , what goes through your mind as you watch it ?
what makes yours so effective , do you think ?
so you say you just keeping on climbing the mountain . is the mountain closer to mt . everest or more like henman hill ?
are you going to go to any games with spike ?
such a hard-fought match . were you very disappointed at the end of it ? did you guys say anything to each other at the end of the match when you shook hands ?
i have seen you lose before when you 're very upset . you seem okay today . do you feel like you gave it your best ?
overall , how would you assess your performance over the entire tournament ?
players do n't like to say who they wish to meet in the next round , but you 're not like most players . maybe you could tell us .
who do you expect to play ?
you had a tough match with caroline in miami . you won it . how do you remember that match ?
you 're the only player this year that has reached three quarterfinals at grand slams .
can you talk about what you 've added to your game this year since you 've been making such good results at grand slams .
how has the planning changed ?
returning to the miami match with wozniacki , what was the key for you that night ?
congratulations . what was working well for you out there today ?
you said when you lost the first set you thought that it would be a sign of what happened in the french open . could you talk a little bit about that .
so how nervous were you closing the match out ?
so on the changeovers when it got towards the end of the third set , were you thinking about roland garros at all and were you able to keep your mind off of that ?
when you the missed backhand volley on your first match point , what kind of thoughts went through your mind ? how did you manage to pull yourself together ?
at any point in this year have you gotten impatient with your results and said , my game is already here ; i should be doing better ; when am i gon na have my major , major breakthrough ?
how different did you feel in the third set today as compared to that third set against her in the french open ?
your first serve got a lot better after that first set . how did that change points once you started getting that first serve in a lot more ?
does it matter to you to be the top russian player , or is that a secondary goal and your main goal is to be , i do n't know , top 5 , win a grand slam ? talk about where that falls and your goals .
can you just talk about serena ? obviously francesca is a great player , but serena is a big step up on hard courts in the u.s. , i would think , huh ?
what 's the most difficult thing about playing serena ?
after the azarenka match , she said that when serena is on a roll and really playing well , the best way she can describe it for the opponent is painful . when serena is on her game at her best , how would you describe it ?
what do you think the chances are for other players as serena moves on in the tournament ?
in addition to serena 's power and her strokes , she can often be a very intimidating opponent . in the first set i think to go up 4-3 she fended off a break point , and for the first time really screamed , come on . did that episode rattle you or affect you ? in general , how do you think you did with sort of the mind games or the psychology of facing her today ?
you might still be out there if your serve had been going better , it seems . what was it with the serves ? is it the wind or are you disappointed with the way you served ?
is it difficult for you to catch your toss ? you 've always had , it seems , a problem with tossing . but in these conditions you did n't seem to catch your toss even when it was going way out to the right .
once again , we have a tournament where serbians have done incredibly well . you have been asked this a million times , but please , what makes serbian tennis so good ?
on court , is there anything in particular , a certain kind of toughness or part of the game on court that is common to serbs ?
serena is considered to have one of the best serves in the women 's game . but on second serve you were standing way inside the baseline to receive her . is that what you normally do with her or with others ?
if novak does indeed advance to play janko in the next round , do you have any insight into the emotions into davis cup teammates , two serbians who know each other well playing each other ? are you generally supportive of one another ? will that , do you think , be a difficult dynamic ?
what would you say novak 's year and his wimbledon championship mean to serbia ?
if he were to win it here , what do you think it would mean ?
novak , talk about his role in serbia . is he the most important person in serbia ?
he 's known for his whackiness , his jokes . when did you realize this guy was special ? do you have an early story you could share with us ?
has he ever done your fist pump ?
have you and nigel talked about where you 're gon na set up like your training base for the rest of the year ?
not having great results so far this season , what do you take away from the open ? it looked like you were pretty confident out there today .
how did you pull that match out ?
were you getting physically ill behind the baseline ?
the second set ?
can you talk about that fourth set point where you hit the forehand and leaped into the air ? could you have played a third set physically ? do you think you could have held out ?
this is the only grand slam you have reached the quarterfinals at , and you 've done it now three years out of the last four .
what is it about this slam out of the others that maybe you feel more comfortable here or play your best ?
when you were down the fourth set point in the match against zvonareva two years ago ...
do you feel like you 're doing too much running in these matches ? would you like to try to close the points quicker ?
you served for first set the second time at 5-4 , and i think you hit two aces .
what was going through your mind ? her second-serve return is so good .
i do n't know if you mentioned this , but outside of an injury have you ever felt worse physically on the court ?
what was the second worst ?
in your last two quarterfinals you played safina , then you played serena , and now you 're going to be playing kerber , who you 're supposed to be a better player than , so ...
what 's the situation for you ?
i think there is only one woman left who is still in the singles and doubles . is it difficult for you to put in the same focus in both tournaments ?
what would it mean to you to reach a semifinals after all these years in grand slams ?
you 're one of the three oldest women left in the singles draw . do you know this ?
how does it make you feel ?
how motivating is it to have somebody like francesca around who is in the same ranking place as you , 10 to 20 , and then wins the tournament and you think , hey , i play with her ; i can beat her ; she wins a grand slam ; why ca n't i ?
how did you prepare before this game ? it 's the 6th time you beat peng shuai .
is it the same strategy as you used before ?
you said when maria double-faulted the first two points of the other match that you were happy . so when peng missed the forehand volley at match point into the net , were you happy ?
how happy ?
this was your first time on the new court , 17. did anything about it strike you ? was it different ?
because it 's sunken , does it have a different feel , the surroundings ?
there has been a lot of talk here of the young americans and who 's going to replace serena . i wonder if there is a lot of talk in germany about the young germans and who is going to be the next steffi . do you hear that at all ?
can you explain how you all sort of kind of came up at the same time ?
were you injured when you ran into the wall and did the splits ?
have you ever done splits quite that good ?
how fast did those first five games go by ? was that as good as you could play tennis for 17 minutes ?
what is your secret ? how can you play so well for such a long time ?
do you have a special kind of practicing or strength ?
azarenka was saying she thinks you 're playing some of your best tennis since she 's played you . would you agree with that statement ?
5-3 in the second set when it looked like you had won the match , you were kind of walking off . then the line umpire made the call . you asked for the review . is it hard to get back in the mindset of , i have to keep playing ?
your dad just said at one point he thought you really were going to leave us , you were going to die . what were your thoughts on that situation ?
azarenka said that first 17 minutes , five games , the best way she could describe it is 'painful . ' what is it like from your standpoint to be dominating like that , and how would you describe the feeling when you 're playing that well ?
for you , is there a feeling you can really capture , throughout your career , there are those times where you feel invincible ? what is that like for you ?
was this the quality of a semi or final ?
was there a bit of a shock to you when you had three match points , and then the next thing you know it 's 5-all , a major battle that you may not get out of as quickly ?
then your reaction at the end of the match , what was your feeling ? was it happy ? relief ? a little bit of unhappiness because you almost let it go ?
is that why she was getting returns in , because your serve dropped a little bit ? was she narrowing in on the range some ?
if you 've ever felt like you 've been in the zone , have you felt like it during that time or maybe afterwards ?
in the big picture , with your weapons , on a slow hard court , how do you think you 'd do against steffi and martina at their peaks ?
in the debate , those two as the best of all time , which would you give the edge to ?
how were you feeling fitness-wise at the end of the second set ?
how well do you know sloane stephens at all ?
you never interacted with her ?
having gone through such a terrible experience , does it make you even hungrier to win and want to win ? you seem to have more of that fire . or does it put everything in perspective , tennis is just gravy and i 'll take whatever ?
how is venus doing and what sweet gestures are you doing to make her feel better ?
not rubbing her feet or back for her ?
can you talk about potentially facing ana ivanovic next round ?
would venus feel better if you won this open ?
the other day you said you hate to lose . your dad said that first emerged when you lost to venus when you were seven years old . does that ring true to you ?
what was the problem with each of the injury timeouts ?
was it cramping ?
other than a scalpel , how did they do it ? pulling your shoulders back ? massaging ?
how much joy or pleasure do you get out of playing these matches , long , three-set comeback matches ?
what is the best and worst advice that you have ever received from your parents both in tennis and out of tennis ?
the best advice , the most important things that they have told you .
do you remember when that one was ?
the italians have had such tremendous success in fed cup , in roland garros , a very good tournament here for the italians . if you had to talk about italian tennis and talk just in a few sentences , how would you describe it ? what is the nature ? what is the quality of italian tennis ?
when you 're young , you do n't work just because you want to enjoy life ?
there has been 14 players that have retired during this tournament , which is a record for this tournament . i was wondering ...
that retired during the match . do you see any reason why there would be that many this year ?
is it difficult to keep your body in shape at this point in the season ?
talk some more about pain . is it just something you have to really address mentally ? is it a drain for you , pain , physical pain ?
yeah . as a tennis player , not so young anymore and up against bigger players , your movement is so important . pain , is that something that you just have to work on from a mental point of view ?
on the match point she hit a very good backhand . looked like it would be good . as you looked at that stroke going , did you think , it 's all over ?
you challenged the serve , and you did so after talking to the chair umpire . then when it showed out and you lost the next point , you were pretty unhappy . why was that ?
a lot of older players are kind of peaking in their careers right now . what do you think that is , you know , compared to the younger players ? do you feel like physically you guys are working to get fitter or you have more experience or there 's more mental control ? why is it that mardy fish , you , and several players are playing so well ?
you mentioned venus . what was your reaction upon hearing her having to withdraw and her illness ?
you seem to specialize in playing long matches .
then about four or five years ago you played that match with ai sugiyama that took four or five days , did n't it ?
what is your secret to doing all that ?
you said it was excruciatingly hot but you appeared to handle it quite well .
was your fitness the biggest factor in today 's match ?
other than topspin , did you have more of a game plan ? seemed like you were attacking her second serve fairly well and trying to cut off those angles .
you made a name of yourself pretty much -- i mean , you had a name before , but last year at the us open , between then and now what 's changed ?
now that you 're getting deeper in the slams more regularly , is it still as much fun for you , or do you go in with more expectations ?
do you think you 're ready to become a grand slam champion and lift that trophy ?
to see petra win wimbledon , did that help you in any way to see a younger player sort of finally win a slam ?
you said before the match that you had to go out and you had to play your game . how do you feel you did overall today ?
what did you improve on ? i know you faced each other at the aussie open ; i know that was a little more lopsided . what did you improve on today ?
what was go her game ? aggressiveness ? strength ?
interesting to hear you say that she was more aggressive , because , you know , people say she 's not aggressive .
you had her on the ropes several times on her serve . you broke her three times , but it could have been a lot more .
obviously whenever there is a no.1 player in tennis -- i do n't know , going back to tomas muster or whoever -- who has n't won a slam . there 's always comments and questions , whether it 's a legitimate no.1 . now , we all know caroline also had trouble even reaching finals . what are your thoughts about that frame of mind , that it 's not a real no.1 ?
with all due respect , i was asking you what your thoughts were on that mindset .
how did you feel physically ? you have been playing a lot of tennis the last couple days , both the singles and doubles . did you feel fatigued ?
you were training largely on clay . are you still training primarily on clay ?
just talk about that . is it a plus even coming to a hard court or grass court tournament ?
with women 's doubles , you and your partner , you take on in the next round a couple of american wildcards . are you looking forward to playing them ? overall , with american support , how do you feel the crowd has been the last couple days for you ?
jessica pegula and tara townsend .
they 're wildcards .
after 17 minutes had been played , you were behind 5-0. how do you pull yourself together , which you certainly did ?
do you think it was unfair that you had to play serena in the third round ?
when she is on , like those first 17 minutes , what is it like ?
what are the specifics about what she does that makes it so painful when she 's really on ?
do you think she 's playing at a level to win this whole tournament ?
the highest you 've seen her play ?
could you break that down ? is it strokes , mental toughness , serve ?
are there any other serves in the women 's game that approach hers ?
things got pretty close later . what did you change specifically to make that happen ?
how gratifying was it for you to do that , withstand her storm and really produce some incredible tennis in the second set ?
you said earlier she 's probably playing better than you 've ever seen her . what does that say about her , given what she 's had to go through the last couple of years ?
how great is the distance between serena and the rest of the field ?
what 's next for you on the court and off the court ?
off the court ?
what is tennis like in belarus ?
do you find when you 're there you 're hounded by the media ? are you the 'it ' girl of belarus ?
fashion week , what are you going to do ? just attend shows ?
this is next week ?
you 're going home and coming back to new york city ?
you mentioned playing 'your game . ' you waited too long , you feel ?
when you say 'tight , ' you mean nervous or physically ?
can you assess the way you feel you played today ?
you were saying the other day how it always takes a little bit of adjusting when you first come to a tournament and getting a feel for the surface and everything . you said at the beginning of the second match you were starting to get into your comfort zone more . did you progress towards that point where you feel like you 're playing your top ?
when you got down a break there in the second set , is that a place where you were able to tell yourself to focus better at that point ? did you feel you stepped it up ?
how much do you get out of the opportunity , i guess , if you will , in early matches to be able to maybe lose your game a little bit and then to dig and to find it ? because you ca n't really get away with that when you start to get deeper into the tournament .
that could be against sabine . i do n't know the score right now .
if it were to be sabine ...
yeah .
which are the favorites to win the tournament , in your opinion ?
you had success here and you 've gotten close to winning a grand slam , obviously . what do you think you need to make that final step ?
what adjustments do you have to make from playing the first match on ashe versus if you were scheduled for a night match ?
which do you prefer ?
you 're first among the top seeds to move into the fourth round and also no.2 in the world , but yet you seem to be flying under the radar in terms of people talking about the us open , potential winners being serena perhaps maria sharapova , or sometimes even wozniacki . how do you feel about this position perhaps being viewed as an underdog ?
i 'm sure you do n't wish any ill health on anybody , but when it happens and a player like venus williams drops out and she would have been in your path , does a part of you feel like a door has opened , you know , to clear you through to at least the semis ?
how are you ?
where was your a game today ? what happened ? seemed hitting you were in the back court , you were hitting double faults . did you lose your concentration or your focus ? what was going on with you ?
did you feel like you could rely on your forehand in this match at any point ? did you ever feel comfortable with it ?
your first match you were forced to fight back ; your second match which was quite routine . when you 're in the throes of a match like this , does your mind waft back to either of those two previous matches you played at this tournament ?
you came up with big stuff in cincinnati , but coming here did you ever feel like you really got into a groove in any of your matches , or was it just you lost something along the way ?
yeah , but in the course of the three matches you 've played .
do you feel like you did n't have the rhythm that you had a couple weeks ago or ...
you obviously love the open . you 've worked really hard on your comeback pointing to this tournament . can you just describe your disappointment , your feelings inside ?
you lost to pennetta in los angeles last time you played . any difference between this match and that one ?
this year you never lost when you were in the third set . today do you think you were going to win when you came back from 1-4 to 4-all ?
after making the final at wimbledon and losing the third round here , is that a big set back in terms of the bigger picture ?
the first two games of the third set went to nine and ten minutes each , and she won both of them . they were such long games and so hard-fought . was that a little dispiriting to lose both of those ?
can you talk a little bit about whether or not you felt you played the match on your terms or sort of largely on hers ?
what are your plans when you leave the national tennis center right now ? do you have anything planned for the evening ? how are you gon na deal with this loss as you go forward now ?
you were moving your arm around at one point . were you in any pain ?
do you feel like in a way you beat yourself today ?
rather than you go out and you play a great match , you 're simply outplayed by an opponent today maybe ?
are those kind of losses harder to take than when you go out and play , you know , a great match but you just happen to run into somebody who plays a little bit better ?
when you get home and settle in , what will you do ? i 've lost this . what are you gon na do to regain and bring your a game back ? you certainly have a fabulous game .
will you call me ? i 'll give you my number .
how would you describe the challenge that you had serving today and what you need to do to maybe get more consistent with it ?
mentally when you do suffer a double fault at crunch time , how do you try and handle that mentally ? do you try and just block it out ? do you try and accept it ? what goes through your mind ?
you talk a lot about playing aggressive . do you feel like today you were moving forward enough ?
will you go back and watch this match , try to learn from it ?
last year after the open you got sick and the fall in asia was n't that good . i know it 's tough , but looking forward , how motivated and pumped up are you to go to asia and go to the championships and keep moving on ?
you know what i 'm saying ?
congratulations . that was a very nice win .
looked like you were almost celebrating a championship out there . how good did it feel ?
she was building back momentum in that final set , had gotten it back to tied , and then she goes out and throws down a couple of double faults .
she paid compliments to you , that you played a very , very smart game out there . she made a lot of errors , no doubt , and gave away a lot of points , but you also earned some points out there . are you happy ?
when she double-faulted to begin the final --
how much confidence did you take from that ?
what was your strategy coming into that match ?
you said the other day that you had been losing a lot of three-setters this year recently , and also said it 's going to change soon . then it did . it obviously did today . how confident were you that really at this us open you get to a third set on the big stadium and all of a sudden the luck changes ?
you also said that coming to new york things were n't going that great , but you come to new york , a place where you 've done well , and the good feelings come back on court .
that 's part of things changing , just being at a tournament where you 've done well ?
sharapova is a very dramatic player , very loud out there . did it inspire you to find how hard you were making her work , or do you find some of that annoying and maybe just a bit of gamesmanship ?
peng shuai next . can you talk about that matchup ?
would the flavia pennetta of five years ago on match point have went for an outright , down-the-line winner on the return ? so five years ago , as a same player against someone like sharapova , would you go for the winner down the line ?
as you said , you are going to play doubles .
how tough it is to play both doubles and singles ?
these types of victories , are these the ones that make the work all worth it ?
how do you feel about your form now ?
a lot of players have said before that some of them need time to get confidence . some are bored with confidence and have always had it . how about you ?
do you feel like you have played too many matches before the tournament ? do you feel any fatigue ?
what tells you that your game is ready to take the next step ? can you take the next step ? do you know your game is there ?
can you talk a little bit about your next match with vera .
today you hit a lot of dropshots and the volley . you tried to have your dropshot volley work , it 's what you tried to do ?
you 're inspiring to watch . you definitely brought your a game on today . you handled the wind with aplomb . what will you do to keep the serena express moving ? because it 's moving .
yes , it is .
you would have had every reason in the world to be distracted today given what happened with venus yesterday . how difficult was it for you to just come out here and take care of your business with what she 's going through ?
the syndrome has a genetic component to it . how aware are you of that ? and is this now something you 're going to be monitoring yourself ?
what 's your sense of what she 's had to endure so far ? what 's your sense of what lies ahead for her ?
is it harder for you to deal with venus being sick than when you are n't healthy in any way ? which is harder emotionally to have happen ?
you and your family probably have gone through more drama than any family in sports history , going back to the difficult crowds , loss of life , surgeries , on and on . various situations . could you reflect on that and what that says inside you or how you dealt with that inside you ?
so you were sometimes dismissive of some of the questions when we asked about what the meaning of that really incredible incident here was . i know it was a couple years ago , but can you talk about what you learned from this really incredible incident here ?
well , it 's not about me .
i did n't hear the post-match interview on tv . i could see it . you seemed to be laughing a lot . what was the subject and why were you in such a good mood , besides winning 6-love 6-1 ?
is the level of tennis you 're playing now , does it surprise you that -- say , six months ago could you have imagined being out here in a second-round match and making it look pretty easy ?
wozniacki tweeted yesterday that you were giving her relationship advice . just curious what advice that might have been .
what was it ? what was it ?
how much better can you play ? do you feel like there 's a lot of room for improvement over , for example , what you showed today ?
can you give us an update on your sister , what she 's doing now since she 's withdrawn ?
i 'm liking the nail polish that you have on . how is that going for you ? what 's coming up on your fall preview on hsn ?
krajicek played the first grand slam main draw since 2007. what do you think that she 's kind of coming back now ?
it has n't been determined who you 'll face next , but if it is azarenka , obviously because of your relatively low seeding , that 's a quite a big match for a third-round encounter . can you describe what is so special about her game and what sort of challenge that is for you ?
given the health challenges that you have had this past six months and the other interests you have , can you explain what exactly it is that you get out of competing ? what is the essential lure that draws you back to tennis at this point ?
what do you think about the young american girls that played well yesterday ? christina mchale and irina falconi , who got moved to ashe when venus went out . what do you think of their performances yesterday ?
what does it mean for you to win and what was the reason you were able to keep things together ?
how does this feel different than when you were here two years ago in the juniors ?
have you grown taller in the last year or so ?
are you surprised by this or did you expect this ?
119-mile-an-hour ace .
is that tops for you in terms of speed ?
were you completely sure you were challenging ? were you on top of it , the procedure ?
you challenged .
you got off to a big lead . you could easily get into your head , oh , my gosh , us open , big-name player . obviously things got tight in the second set . what was that like mentally ?
you seemed to win the first set fairly routinely and then either lose the second set or have a hard time . is that a mental thing ?
it 's real early in the tournament . it 's been a good start for the young american women .
what is your feeling ? are you feeling like you can go to the top here or you 're not so sure , one step at a time ?
what about the shoes ?
what kind of car ?
how does a bright girl like you get such a first name ?
that was pretty fortunate . if you were alexandra stephens , that would be pretty confusing .
on your forehand , you seemed to wrong-foot a couple times on your running forehand . do you remember that at all ?
twice .
yes .
you make almost no noise out there . you 're like an anti-grunter . is that a conscious thing ? did you always play that way ? you 're very quiet .
nick ?
were you always an aggressive player ?
what does venus williams ' example mean to you and what was your reaction when you heard about her illness ?
what do you like most about her ?
when you read the americans are in a downtime in terms of tennis , does that create a chip on your shoulder ?
she declared yesterday the lull is over .
talk about l.a. where have you grown up , lived ? do you love it to bits ?
what region of l.a. do you live in ?
at riviera , who are some of the people you hit with there ?
did you move there because of your coach ?
you 're buying a car but you do n't like to drive ?
living near the 405 is bad for someone who does n't like traffic .
are you looking forward to getting out there with a grand slam former champion ?
pete used to live in the hollywood hills . bel aire , that 's a pretty high-rent district . how did you wind up there ?
you always are putting out some inspirational and positive sayings . they 're geared towards women , relationships . what inspires that ?
do you look for stuff like that ?
what about ana ivanovic , former french champion ? talk about her and your prospects .
are you ready for ashe ?
you did n't want ashe ?
falconi got ashe .
she said , let 's bring it on .
are you going to have the american flag like irina does ?
what effect have serena and venus had on you as a person and player ?
you do n't seem intimidated by all this . does n't seem to awe you at all . are you comfortable in your surroundings ?
a young player coming up , sometimes it can be a little scary stepping out in a big stadium , flushing meadows .
you 're so popular with the crowds everywhere you play because of the style of the game , i think . how do you find the atmosphere here with , say , roland garros ?
do you prefer one over the other ?
but you would n't change your style of play to suit different court surface or speed ?
did you have any specific strategies coming into this match , like play against zheng ?
you seemed especially happy in your post-match dance . do you think it was because you had to face such an uphill battle after losing the first set ?
you 're obviously wearing a lot less tape this week than you were back in cincinnati . how 's the knee feeling ?
do any other athletes out there in other sports remind you of yourself ?
any sport .
your personality , the way you show color on the court .
the personality and the way you show color on the court .
how about marat safin ?
well , you say you just want to be me . what does that mean to you ?
novak did his absolutely fabulous imitations that people just loved , but then got a lot of ...
were you kind of sad that he stopped doing those ?
who are your favorite male players to watch ?
why ?
how about monfils ?
you 're one of five german players in the second round alone . can you talk about what ir means to german tennis to have so many players in the tournament ?
obviously there has been a gap since steffi graf . nowadays can you use her for anything , like just talk to her and see what 's ...
some people say the germans are coming now ; there is a big , nice group . there is always this hunger in america ; when is the next big american coming ? do you understand that ? does it mystify you ? do you like it ? or is it overkill ?
what does it say that on the one hand the best player in german history , really of all time perhaps arguably , steffi , was so focused . she had that laser focus , all business , and yet others - say , serena , certainly yourself - what does that say about the nature of the game and how it can be approached differently ?
do you ever feel that the officiating is keeping down the personality , your personality or tsonga 's , these other players that you like ? do you feel that at all these days ?
seems like you said your ankle was good . when you get to the us open your back hurts . is this a hard court thing for you ?
you 've had a lot of treatment on court for your back at this tournament , have you not ?
just this match ?
what are your thoughts going forward ? will it hurt your chances going forward , or is this ...
when did this happen ?
so you woke up today fine ?
how do you feel now ?
what treatment beyond massage ? electric stimulation ?
what 's it like to play a player whose serve just unravels ? dokic said that off the ground she felt she played better than you , but her serve killed her .
yes , she did .
the first one might have been a bit easy , but this one was a little testier out there today . talk about that .
are you pleased with the way you played today ?
can you talk about the challenges of the next match coming up ? medina garrigues is you 're going to be playing .
first set you won all 14 points at the net , but you seemed to like abandon that strategy . you run out of gas ?
when you have a match like this where you do n't play your best , do you just look at it and say , well , i advanced to the next round ; i 'll worry about it later ? does it kind of bother you that here 's a grand slam , you made the finals a year ago , and you did n't play very well today ?
you said on monday that , you know , the first-round match is always a period of adjustment , getting a feeling for the court and the atmosphere and the tournament itself . where in a grand slam fortnight do you generally find that you really hit your stride ?
is there a difference for you between matches in the morning and the evening , maybe with the crowd or something like that ?
why do you think you get off to these slow starts in the grand slams , first couple rounds ?
if you could tell us when you found out about this .
did you see venus here at all today ?
do you feel disappointed that you 're unable to play ?
mixed emotions ?
you would n't use the word `` lucky '' to describe the fact that you do n't have to face her , then ?
had you seen her play an monday ? she was pretty impressive .
you said you saw her in the locker room or on the courts ? where did you see her today ?
she did n't say anything to you one way or another ?
since your match got canceled , do you use the extra time to practice ?
she says she has an immune disease of some sort that causes pain in her joints . i guess it 's a chronic problem , a problem she has a lot . so i guess i would ask you , if this is the end for venus williams , how would you think of her career ?
when you saw her , did you see anything you would describe as unusual ?
no physios around , nobody like that ?
you got arthur ashe . what were your thoughts when you realized you would be playing on a show court ?
must have been pretty exciting once you got in there . crowd seemed to really be behind you .
after the match you waved the american flag . i 've never seen that before .
that 's true . what did you hope to convey by doing that ?
whose idea was that ?
according to your bio , you were born in ecuador . when did you move to the united states ?
did you go to the open when you were a kid all these years ?
when did you move out of new york to atlanta ?
what part of new york ?
that third set , you were down love-3 . then what happened ?
what about the last point when you were heading straight for the chair ump ?
you mentioned your team and your coach . is your coach a woman , kim ?
what 's it like having a female coach on your team or hitting partner ? do you think she gives you some insight into the women 's game ?
are you surprised there are n't more female coaches in the game ?
you said yesterday that your folks are still down in florida . have you had them book a flight or are you going to keep them down there for good luck ?
for your next match ?
when you came to the open , who did you like to watch ? what players do you like to watch now ?
what was your reaction to the fans to you ?
we 're obviously in a little bit of a lull in terms of women 's tennis in this country .
you 're tired of hearing that . you spoke about belief in your game . what is your belief in your own game ? how high do you think you can go in this terribly competitive game ?
with venus dropping out today , is that a little bit of disappointment potentially because you could have faced her maybe the next round or the round after that ?
how do you prepare for lisicki ?
you saw that christina mchale won her match as well . talking about the americans being here , i know you are friends ; what does it mean to have you both win your second-round matches ?
do you consider yourself a new yorker ?
biggest arena you played in before ? did you ever steal a look up to the ozone seats ?
before ashe .
was it , oh , my god ? what was your take ?
had you been in there before ?
did the cross thought your mind you were literally being picked to replace venus williams ?
you recently turned 21. do you have plans on celebrating anytime soon ?
how would you celebrate ?
do you keep the flag in your bag every match ?
how long have you had it for ?
did you think at the time you were a student at georgia tech you were ever going to be soon play with the star of the tennis in america , serena williams ?
did you watch when you were four or five years old when steffi graf was a champion ?
how about gabriela sabatini ?
i know you like to blog . i 've seen a lot of your written work . are you writing currently during this tournament ? if you write about today , what would you write , maybe the first line ?
how old were you when you moved to florida ?
where is home now ?
i know it 's early , but are you playing well enough to win this tournament ?
mary joe fernandez and some of the tv people were saying in order for you to win a grand slam , you need to develop a big shot , a more aggressive shot , to beat serena and venus and those kind of players . do you agree with that , or can you play the style you 're playing and win ?
you seemed very comfortable in attacking today . is it part of your strategy now to try to set up yourself for an attack or just is it just taking advantage of a particularly good situation where it makes sense to come in ?
do you think it 's fair to say that at times this summer you went a little bit away from your base , tried to improve too fast in matches , and maybe that 's why you took some losses you usually would n't take ?
so how did you get yourself comfortable again last week ?
what mistakes did you make , do you feel , in those losses ? what did you try and change that did n't really work out ?
i understand you 're friendly with a golfer rory mcilroy who won golf 's u.s. open . has he had a little fun with you about dare you to win this us open , trying to keep up ?
could you describe the difference playing on arthur ashe ashe atmosphere-wise and even condition-wise in the day versus the night ?
what 's your confidence level now ? is it high coming off of new haven , or do you look back at the summer and say , not so high ?
is there ever a time when being no.1 feels more like a burden than an honor ?
so despite not winning a major at this point and only reaching the one final here two years ago , you 're satisfied with what you 've done to be no.1 ?
are you sometimes amused by all this going on as though you did n't know how to play tennis ?
any confessions of something else we should know about ?
there was some talk during the french open that you were considering hiring martina navratilova to be your coach . have there been any developments in this area of your game ?
among other things , she would have been one of the few female tennis coaches on the women 's tour . why do you think there are so few female tennis coaches on the wta tour ?
where do things stand with you on the coaching front now ? how settled are you there ?
it 's not that common , though , for a top player to hire a mystery coach who is kind of in the background . just talk about that from your perspective , because it is a little strange for you as no.1 to make a major hire and basically no one except for you and your team know who it is .
have you gotten any advice from him in the last week or two ? i understand he 's watching video . are you talking to him ?
being at yale last week and being a 21 year old , do you ever think about taking college classes and going to university ?
did it seem like a really long time to get a first-round match for you to play ?
you were so composed when you came out and throughout the match . it was difficult to read your emotions . could you share with us at all your emotions when you walked out , how you felt .
in your postgame interview on the court you mentioned you felt nervous . that 's surprising given your wins here . what were the things running through your mind ?
is that a new heart ? looks like it has a little more sparkle on it .
after the match you said if you would critique yourself , you would have given yourself a b. what could you have done differently to give yourself an a ?
your emotions were so different at wimbledon after your first match . you had such a release of joy , tears , everything . was this different tonight ?
the last time you played here was n't a great occasion . when you walked out on the court tonight , what were you feeling ?
since you mention the time , does it matter whether you 're on the court at 11:30 p.m. or 11:30 a.m. ? is there any difference body-clockwise ?
how was it waiting for rafa to finish , three hours ?
you 're cool with the guys and the women switching ?
they billed this as nadal as the warmup act for your match . how does that make you feel ?
it 's like coldplay warming up for green day .
end of the match , you 're up 5-1 in the second set , 15-love , you 're still hustling . what is it that drives you in that moment ?
you 're an emotional person , a thoughtful person . you get on the court . how do you not think about the clijsters match a little bit ?
are you glad that this moment is over , now you 've played that match ?
are you reluctant to put the label 'favorite ' on yourself ?
given your post-match routine , realistically what time are you looking at falling asleep tonight ?
will you be awake when venus plays tomorrow ?
rafael said when he got back to manhattan at 4:30 in the morning after one of his late matches the only food he could find is mcdonald 's . what are you going to do for food ?
did you ever get those christian louboutins you were talking about ?
can you describe the tiebreak , what your mindset was in that ? was there a key point or two you remember ?
did you let down in the second set or did she play better ?
what are your expectations of yourself today ?
it seems like you were pretty carefree and it was almost like gravy for you at this point .
is your mom always like that ?
you were noticing where your mother and brother were during the match ?
did you ask him what he was doing ?
do all you american teenagers pay attention to what the others are doing ? do you look at the draw , check their scores ?
what about madison ?
how did you handle what happened in paris ?
did you feel like you handled it the right way and built upon it ?
here or there ?
does it change your preparation ? when you feel any kind of anxiety , all that stuff coming on , since you 've been through it again , do you know what to do ?
in paris , were you in a similar situation ?
is the gold nail polish , does that mean anything ?
how do you deal with the fumes ?
are you a little serena in training here ?
are you in high school now ?
you graduated ?
are you thinking about that ?
what happened on that last service game ?
how glad were you not to have to serve again by ...
when are you gon na run for prime minister ?
what are your feelings about new york ?
how would you describe the energy ?
most players just stay by the hotel , but do you go down to the village or explore ?
what will a successful open be for you today ? this year ?
how did court 17 feel ? it 's a new court .
it seemed like you were having a little bit of trouble with your toss on your serve . do you think that had anything to do with the court ?
what is your confidence level coming off of dallas ?
any parallels to the grass court winning before going to wimbledon , just the momentum that brought you to the semis ?
you got here today ?
oh , yesterday ?
some people are talking about you as a dark horse candidate to maybe win here as a first-time grand slam winner . what do you think of that ? do you pay attention to it ?
playing venus second round , how tough is that gon na be ?
do you just feel like you 're a favorite ? i mean , obviously venus has won here twice ; yet she has n't played all year or played very little this year , and you 've had these victories . do you feel like you 're a favorite or do you go in with the confidence of a favorite ?
how disappointing is this for you ?
you added the new haven tournament . was that added late in your schedule ?
do you feel like you 've been struggling ? since roland garros you 've had early-round exits from tournaments . can you describe what you 're struggling with right now ?
all four of the reigning grand slam champions are now gone from this tournament . is that the depth of women 's tennis , or is it a long season and just hard to keep that fitness ?
you said right now your confidence is very low .
do you feel coming into this tournament that you just did n't have that self-confidence ? do you think that contributed to the loss today ?
so after a long , successful season , do you feel tired at this point of the season when you come to the last grand slam ?
do you think it 's pressure , that having won and becoming even more famous has put that much more pressure on you when you get to the grand slams ?
you were scheduled to make an appearance in chinatown . that appearance was canceled . it was announced that you were going to play in new haven . what happened with that appearance ? did you feel you did n't have the time to do that , that you needed to focus on your tennis ?
no , the monday before .
before that , you were supposed to make an appearance in chinatown .
was new haven added as a late addition to your schedule ?
are you at all dreading the grief you 'll get back at home from this performance ? do you think you 'll get grief from the press in your hometown ?
heck of a first-round match . you just took out the french open champion . what does that mean to you ?
she said she played like shit .
were you surprised ?
how much does that lift your confidence ?
it 's been a good tournament for romania so far .
did you watch any of the match yesterday ?
when you hear that result yesterday , do you even get a little more confidence , if she can do it , i can do it , too ?
she 's the french open champion . you did n't appear intimidated . is it the depth of women 's tennis ? how do you go into that and not feel like you 're playing a grand slam champ ?
when did you hurt your ankle ?
you seem to be playing well since you hurt it .
unusual end , was n't it ?
she ran over quite dramatically watching on the screen .
was it a cramp that was spreading ?
have you heard if she 's all right ?
did you sense she was having problems ?
i guess you were taking control by the time she actually started to suffer . is that fair ?
the first set did n't go your way . how did you turn things around ?
do you think playing in the heat in dallas helped you today ?
kuznetsova in the next round possibly .
is it a big deal for you to get back in the top 50 and penetrate that ceiling ?
did you watch heather yesterday ? is there a slight sense of looking over your shoulder with the young ones coming up fast ?
i think it 's the first time we have two british women into the second round in 20 years .
you said you were going to mix it up before . were you happy with the way you played ?
five grand slam tournaments in a row you 've reached the second round . do you feel in yourself you 've really worked out how to handle these big occasions ?
on a wider theme , the second round of the us open will have no reigning aussie champion , french open champion , or wimbledon champion . is that just a freak or is there a trend ?
did n't used to be like that .
are you pleased with the opening of this tournament , the way you played out there today ?
are you without injury now ? i know you had some issues in toronto .
pain-free ?
what was it with your hand ?
what did you do ?
wrist ?
is it hard to remain patient when you 've come close in majors ? you 've had some bad luck this year in terms of who you 've had to play . is it hard to keep the faith and go out there with the enthusiasm that you need ?
can you complain about your luck , do you feel ?
the luck of your draws .
but you lost to li na in france and she wins the tournament .
so you 're okay with that ?
now i 'm sure you know - i apologize if you do n't know - but now you 've ended up in the same section as serena .
you and caroline , who followed you on this court now , both people are expecting perhaps a grand slam tournament from you . neither of you has quite punched through yet . what do you think about the situation with the two of you ? who do you think will get through first ?
do you feel some sympathy for her when people are always saying , well , she 's no.1 but she has n't won a grand slam ?
you had a lot of success on your second serve today . was there anything in particular you were doing , something you thought was keeping her off balance today ?
when it comes to the us open , playing on the hard court here , what do you think your biggest strength is ?
yes .
what do you think of the atmosphere in ashe ?
is there anything you feel you need to do better to break through and win a major ?
some players say this year the surface might be a little bit slower than last year .
thoughts on the match ?
kind of an unusual entry into this tournament with the hurricane in new york yesterday . talk about what yesterday was like for you .
you mentioned that first matches are extremely difficult . normally you would think that would n't be the case . why would first matches be so difficult ?
you come in as the second seed . talk about coming in as the no.2 seed and the opportunity to showcase your talents in this atmosphere , in these stadiums .
is it different coming in as a second seed in terms of expectations of yourself ?
are you playing your best tennis ?
as the second seed , you 're still not a household name . do you see this as an important tournament for you to advance far , to become a household name , and to get more people in here ?
you must have some mixed emotions on perhaps the biggest day of your life , playing so well and not winning .
how close do you think you came to pulling it off then ?
you obviously had a set way you wanted to play . you did execute it pretty well . how difficult is it to sustain that level again and again against someone who hits the ball like sharapova ?
when you 're out there , you 're very quiet returning shots . your opponent was screaming . was it hard to concentrate ?
was that because when somebody is making such a lot of noise you find yourself being drawn into it ?
when you watch maria as a spectator on the television , is the noise apparent to you ?
you got a pretty good standing ovation when you left . what was the atmosphere like ? how do you feel you handled it ?
there did n't appear to be a trace of nerves . did you sleep well last night ?
have you ever been on court with sharapova before , at bollettieri 's , for example ?
she missed quite a few shots today , much to do with the fact you were playing so well . in terms of weight of shot , does she hit the ball as hard as anyone you 've faced ?
what about the court ? did you ever look up and realize the enormity of it at all ?
what do you think you need to do , heather - you 've made impressive progress this year - to keep on that trajectory ? what parts of your game do you need to improve ?
did you talk to laura about playing sharapova since she had the experience at wimbledon ?
is there a kind of rivalry between you and laura at the moment ?
a rivalry .
how far do you think you 'll go in the rankings , say , in the next year or so ?
where do you play next ?
what 's the plan after that ?
where would that rank as tough first-round matches in a grand slam ?
is there a human tendency to think that reputation could be a strong intangible asset in a first-round match ? does that play into any part of this , the mental aspect ?
but psychologically , is it harder playing unranked opponents ?
what did you make of her performance today ?
what did you know about her before the match ?
what do you attribute the unforced errors to ?
did you find something out there today as the match went on ? can you walk away from this saying , this was okay for a first-round match ?
you 've been working on your volley now for years . some matches you 'll come , take some risks . today she 's making you play a lot of balls . sometimes she 's floating them back . is there a hesitation about going to net and closing points out , or is it based on the day ?
so what about the three-set record this year ?
you were talking last month about glass half full , glass half empty . you should n't be going to three , but you 're winning three-setters . talk about that a little bit .
do you have a great amount of confidence going into third sets knowing how much success you 've had ?
how are you feeling about your serve coming out of the match ?
what 's the biggest difference between playing at the us open and the other grand slams ?
how tired do players get at this point of the season ? how tired are you after playing all year ?
the men 's tour is cutting down their tournaments by two weeks . i wonder if you are fine with the women 's tour schedule now or if you would prefer to have more time off ?
what did you do during the hurricane to entertain yourself ? did you just stare out the window ?
a little fashion question . what were some of the colors ? that was a nice outfit . i did n't know how to describe the colors .
talk a little bit about the matchup with maria the challenges she presents .
just in terms of challenges of facing maria , what that brings to the table .
did you feel like it was 2008 again ?
the walkover obviously helped you to get some more rest . you look like you have more energy tonight .
when you come out and you see your opponent is so taped up on one leg , how does that change your game plan ?
what was the huge difference between the first and second sets ? you obviously broke her a lot in the second ; in the first set once . did her level drop ? yours increase ?
how have your practices been this week ? did you have an idea you would have a good week here based on that ?
you had ricardo sanchez join you here this week . considering you 're in the final , do you think he 's going to be sticking around for a while ?
the first set she had a really lucky shot that just went over the net to get to the to the tiebreak . did that affect your thinking in terms of how the match was going ? it was a tight first set , she gets a lucky shot , and now you got to play a tiebreaker .
you mentioned the forehand errors tonight . is that because you 're trying to be too aggressive ? what 's causing some of those errors , and how do you fix 'em for tomorrow ?
looks like you 're using a new racquet . you 've had an equipment change . talk about that a little bit .
how long have you been testing racquets ?
you served more aces than anyone , i think , here this week . did you know that ? how does that feel ?
as of day before , yesterday night , yeah .
four double faults , three aces .
you saved almost all of your break points tonight , 7 of 8 saved . did you play the points differently ? more focus ? in other words , how did you save as many as you did without getting broken ?
you have a great record against a lot of top players , but maria is not a player you have a very good record against . you two go back a long way . can you talk about your history with her and what 's made it so difficult for you to win against her in the past ?
was there anything you saw on her service game that enabled you to break a little bit easier ?
tonight .
talk about your next match in terms of what you need to do really well against maria .
what specifically do you want to improve before tomorrow ?
i have n't seen the head-to-head between and you maria . in the matches you 've lost to her , is there anything you can think of was the reason why you lost , and what 's the key to not doing that tomorrow ?
have you happy with your year so far ?
can you elaborate on what participating in fed cup means for you ?
you talked at the all-access hour about the unfair criticism caroline wozniacki gets for having no.1 one and not having a slam . you 're also very highly rank and have n't won a slam . in any way do you feel lucky not having that pressure on you ?
how do you feel compared to last year before the us open ? how does your game compare ?
you said you do n't think about all the gossip , just about your game . how do you assess your game ? is it a feeling , a certain number of matches won ?
we 've seen some tough players retire , have children , and come back . do you think there 's any chance elena dementieva might do that ?
do you get more confidence from winning in a close match or from just maybe blowing somebody out when maybe they were n't playing at their best because confidence is so key to the game ?
do you ever wake up and think , my god , i 'm no.2 in the world ?
have you been keeping up with the men 's matches here ?
really ?
whether it 's fed cup or the olympics , a lot times we see safin on the team , on the side . can you talk a little bit about his role is in motivating the team ?
uh-huh .
can you talk about the match ? you seemed to be hitting more errors than usual . something about her ball that does n't line up right with your style of play ?
you mentioned your record against her . yesterday we were talking about how you kind of figured out li na . what specifically , big picture about maria , is so difficult for you ?
how do you not have that history in your mind as you 're walking on the court ?
you 've had a lot of wins against serena and other top players . is sharapova your hardest challenge by far among other players on tour ?
can you describe the similar game style that you mentioned ?
going back to roland garros and getting a taste of the final , what did do differently or working that much harder at after you had that experience from then until now ?
you 've played so much tennis in your life . does the potential of losing a set 6-love still bother you ? do you have a different mindset at 5-love ?
you made the finals in toronto and the quarters here , quarters at the us open last year . confidence has to be fairly high going into new york .
talk a little bit more about the state of tennis in australia . obviously the fans are outstanding and you 've had a number of legendary players , particularly on the men 's side .
like with li na winning , china , there 's been a lot of activity in china . what 's going on with youth tennis in australia ? is it big as it used to be ?
you probably dreamed of being in the top 10 as a kid , and now you 've been there for a while . how does the dream compare to the reality ?
obviously it 's not expected with shuai peng having to withdraw . what does that do to you in terms of scheduling for you match against petkovic tomorrow ?
you were one of the first players to sign with an asian clothing company . share a little bit about your appearances with that company in asia .
what will you have to do against andrea tomorrow ?
jelena , you with this walkover get more points and more rankings , which helps keep you as the no.1 serbian player . is that something that 's important to you ?
have you watched a lot of men 's matches ? if so , which ones ?
do you have a preference for when you would play tomorrow if it 's up to you ?
you always take your balls from the ball kid on one side . why ?
you built a house in san diego recently . how did you go about choosing to live there ?
will you watch djokovic tonight ?
your serve speeds are much faster than they used to be .
yours . and djokovic 's probably .
is it just technique ?
do you make it a point to get together with other serbian players before tournaments or whatever , just when you 're at the same site , go to dinner or whatever ?
you look tired . are you tired today ?
no , you just sound tired . i do n't see the bags .
the walkover probably helps you in that regard . gives you an extra day to recover .
congratulations on your win .
you seem to have very varied head-to-heads with certain players . with certain players you always do well , li , for example . is there something about your game that you think makes some players unable to deal with it ever ?
talk a little bit about the difference between the second and third set there and how li was able to come back and how you settled yourself . looked like you were getting frustrated on the court in the second .
having played all the way to the final last week , are you glad to have gotten a break yesterday with serena pulling out ?
i know you had n't been happy with the beginning of your 2011. what do you think you were able to change to get going the last couple weeks ?
is your confidence much higher now ?
li na was saying she was finding it a bit demoralizing against your serve . obviously your serve is a key component of your game . do you ever get that sense when you 're serving against somebody , that they have to work so hard to try and even get a point off your serve , and then you fire an ace ? do you get a sense it 's demoralizing to them body language-wise ?
with serena pulling out and a bunch of other people already exiting the tournament , this week is very wide open . what would winning this title mean to you if you were able to ?
you 're one of the few players that does n't use on-court coaching at all .
what 's the rationale behind that ?
sometimes it 's a distraction . do you think it can disturb you , your focus ?
you think that the reason , one of the reasons that older players have been doing well in grand slams compared to the younger generation , is that younger generations came up during this era when on-court coaching was allowed ?
you think having younger players call their coaches during tournaments slows their development ?
it 's wide open here this week , and also wide open for new york . do you think it 's a good opportunity for to you really make a push ?
just a quick question not related to the match . i saw that you changed back into your white wimbledon dress for today . you were wearing the darker outfit for the rest of the us open series . was that a heat consideration ?
talk about you win today . how did you feel out there ?
when was the last time you returned serve that well ?
going back to the weather , can you talk a little bit about how conditions and the weather and the wind , precipitation , things like that , talk about how that might affect your game .
you talked about knowing what court you play on . i saw that you were trying to practice earlier in the morning and had an overlap with fernando verdasco . talk about that .
what happened ? how were you able to resolve that ?
has that ever happened in any of these combined events where you 've been , as you said , double booked on a practice court ?
has it ever happened to you ?
is this a time year when players are particularly protective about their practice times ?
this is the first time this tournament has been combined . do you feel like the wta players or players in general seem to be more territorial about courts and things like that now that it 's more crowded ?
do you feel like the wta players need to stick up for themselves more as far as getting courts for matches , good court placement ?
you have sam stosur next . you obviously have a very good record against her . what is it about the matchup that seems to go with you every single time ?
did sasha get an invitation to kris humphries ' wedding this weekend ?
will he go without his plus one ?
so another long absence for you guys ?
this is the first sort of more high-profile relationship you 've been in . obviously you 're engaged now to another athlete . caroline wozniacki was here with rory mcilroy earlier in the week . is that something you had to get used to , having a new dimension of attention towards you ?
do you have any advice for kids that might want to play tennis when they get older ?
my audience is 8 to 14 , so if they wanted to play tennis , what advice would you give them ?
looked like you were n't 100 % out there today . talk about what was wrong .
was it heat exhaustion or something like that ?
based on your performance here , what are you going to work on on the practice court before the us open ?
do you remember that match you played against safina at the us open ?
talk about what your mindset was going into the tournament then , playing the no.1 , and how it 'll be different this time ?
is there a different feeling playing a grand slam event ?
just how different does it feel ? i think when you beat safina you were close to no.81 in the world , somewhere around there . now you 're in the top 10 and a defending grand slam champion . how does that sort of change your outlook going into the us open , knowing there is sort of more of a target on your back ?
how do you think you 've improved during that time ?
yeah .
just talk a little bit about that specifically .
in your earlier match you took a couple of coaching timeouts . how come you did n't take any today ?
actually on that note , you 're one of the only players who is young enough to have come up in the wta tour during a time when there has always been on-court coaching allowed . you 're the only one that 's been able to win a grand slam , a tournament where it 's not allowed . do you think there is a big difference of having that available and not available ?
what 's your plan between now and new york ? where are you going to train ?
did you have any emotional letdown or mental fatigue after wimbledon ?
you 're doing a lot more of these pressers in the bigger rooms and everything . how are you enjoying them so far ?
does the winning wimbledon change anything when you go on the court now ?
has it changed your schedule between matches or during a tournament or anything as far as ...
you look really pretty in the strong is beautiful ad . how did you enjoy doing those ?
can you just give us your impressions of the match .
have you felt good in practices coming into this week ?
looking back on it now , is there anything you think you could have done differently ?
because your week is ending earlier here than you expected , what are your plans between now and when new haven starts next week ?
do you think there is anything that 's changed in your game ? you 've lost more matches recently than you have in the past . is there anything in your game that 's slipped at all in ?
anything in particular she was doing that was troublesome for you today ?
it was a pretty clean match . not a lot of unforced errors .
is that a big difference ?
could you describe the disappointment ?
how important will it be to get some matches under your belt before new york ?
this has been a different week for you because you 've had all that attention around rory mcilroy being here with you . was that difficult for you to adjust to ?
you do n't think it changed any of your mindset or preparations this week ?
you 're someone who tends to be very consistent week to week . is it sort of a bit of a shock to have two first-round exits in terms rhythm you 're used to having ?
you visited serena when she was not doing well , and i saw her giving you some words and some hugs . could you say what she was saying to you ?
is it a case of some sharpness is missing ? can you put your finger on something that 's not quite the way you would like it to be ?
two weeks ago agnieszka radwanska beat mchale 6-0 , 6-2 , as i remember . was it different mchale today , or you did n't play to your expectations ?
we 've seen players switch equipment , and it 's taken them a few months . novak is an obvious example . are you feeling okay with your equipment ?
as you mentioned , in recent months you 've had a few tough results . what do you do you when you go back to the practice court to try and turn it around ?
is this related to the injury that you suffered in german with the glass in your foot at all ?
did you feel that at any point in the match yesterday ?
are you disappointed given how you 've been playing lately ?
will this withdrawal play on your chances at the us open ?
did you try to practice this morning and that 's when it became obvious that you needed to do this ? can you take us through just how you came to withdraw ?
hypothetically , if yesterday 's match did go to a third set , do you think you would have continued to play ?
what 's the plan now ? will you rest for a while or continue to practice ? what will you do ?
i 've heard that one of your friends , kim kardashian is getting married this weekend . are you planning on attending that ?
would you like to explain exactly how you feel injury-wise ?
yeah . i 'm recording .
with everything you 've been through with this injury does that flare-up scare you at all ?
you and your body ?
how you think you did today ?
were you happier with how you served today ?
in canada and here we 've had a lot upsets . why do you think that 's happening ?
looks like we have a familiar face back in your box . talk about working with ricardo sanchez again .
what do you think you 're doing better and worse than when you were no.1 in 2008 ?
what changed the match ? first set was close and then you started rolling in the second and third sets .
i thought you had to stop play .
did you pick up anything on her serve ? you were breaking her a lot more frequently .
you said you felt like you got a couple bad calls . do you think she did as well ?
i 'm wondering if you did .
i watched , yeah , the second and third .
i missed the first .
at the end of the third set , you were up by quite a lot but you your body language seemed like it was so-so .
in the third set , right after you broke her the second time to start , she got really frustrated . what do you do as a player to capitalize on that when you know your opponent is really getting frustrated ? is it increase your focus ? do you do anything differently ?
has the weather helped you this year ? last year was extremely hot .
is the weather here better this year ?
caroline wozniacki , the pressure she 's under right now , can you empathize with her ?
we 're getting close to the us open and the first time serena has been back there since her episode . what do you remember from when you saw that for the first time ?
when you saw her have her outburst two years ago against clijsters at the us open . what were your thoughts when you first saw that ? remember when she was ...
i kid you not , i heard a fan during this match say that your legs look skinny . i was wondering when the last time you heard that was and where your level of fitness is now . is this the most fit you 've been since 2008 ?
what did you miss the most when you were out for that extended period of time ?
talk about the second set . you were up 5-1 and then you got down 6-5. i saw you look over to your box a lot kind of real frustrated . talk about that .
do you have any fatigue that 's going on from playing a lot of matches and winning two tournaments ?
is it mental or physical fatigue ?
what got you in so late ?
how has your attitude changed between pre- and post-injury in terms of your approach on the court ? today you were maybe more stoic and less animated .
and you 're wearing green and black . is that a superstition now ? are you going to keep on doing it until you stop winning ?
seems like you got a lot fan support in toronto and also here . do you see a noticeable difference in the amount of applause since you came back ?
how would you describe your work with mackie ? he 's worked with so many athletes from all different sports over the years . how has he helped you these last couple years ?
how do you do that ? when he talks , he talks faster than you serve .
is there anything in your game that you want to work on that is n't back to 100 % yet ?
you talk about all your fans . one place you have a lot of fans is on twitter . last night you tweeted some of the lyrics of britney spears single , lucky .
do you relate to lucky 's plight in that song about being a star and crying on the inside ?
are there other brittany songs that you relate to too , like do you ever listen to stronger , for example ?
is there anyone who drives you crazy ?
anyone you want to name ?
you have n't won three tournaments in a row since 2008. does that seem like forever ago ?
key biscayne , one in europe , and charleston .
do you divide your career into your pre- health issues and post-health issues . does this almost feel like a second career ?
because you 're a dangerous floater , you 're going to end of play sam stosur in the next round .
talk about that a little bit .
are you in any dangerous of overplaying at this point ? i mean , looking that second set ...
have you spoken to venus about doing doubles for us open ?
what is it about the us open and new york and playing there that is so amazing ? do you have any memories or funny stories about fans ?
talk about your match today . you obviously blew her away . what you did you do well ?
i saw you in practice earlier this week , and you seemed to be getting pretty frustrated with the mistakes you were making . were you surprised to come out and win the first set 6-0 with how frustrated you were earlier in the week ?
is it hard to maintain focus after you 've had a 6-0 set or things are so one-sided ?
what 's your impressions on playing in the new court 3 ? what did you think of that ?
i heard that you had an interesting delay on the way in to your match today . talk about that .
would you have stopped if you had seen one of your fellow players ?
you and several other serbian players were recently granted diplomatic status . talk about that .
you 're next match is against jie zheng , and you lead 4 to 1. what do you need to do well ?
what are the perks of a diplomatic passport ?
not coming from a small country like serbia , can we really understand the impact of someone like yourself or djokovic who gets to no.1 back at home ?
i do n't come from a small country like serbia . can we even understand the kind of impact that you 've had at home ?
how do you feel about the combined men's/women 's events ? what did you see as the pros and are there some minuses ?
before your match today , you were outside . were you just trying to get away from all the bodies in the players ' lounge ?
i was n't stalking you , but ...
you 're a veteran . after all this time ...
i 'm sorry . after all this time , what motivates you ?
novak is having a great year . can you comment about his year from a players ' standpoint ? do you see anyone on the women 's side being able to do what he 's done , for instance ?
is there anything you 've learned from watching him over the last year ?
are we going to see you together in mixed doubles maybe ?
would you say you had fun today ?
can you talk a bit about the difficulties of playing a lefty .
can you elaborate on that . what was so difficult about what she showed today ?
did you recognize a bit of yourself in her , playing completely without fear ?
she was causing more problems for you with her left-handed serve than you were causing for her with your serve .
what did you make of your performance today ?
you did n't have that much trouble breaking her four times , five times , whatever it was , but on your own service games you were n't doing what you wanted to do . talk a little bit about that .
what , if anything , surprised you about her today in terms of being on the stage of the wimbledon final for the first time , something you experienced before , and how she performed ?
you 've played now all the members of that generation , wozniacki , azarenka , radwanska . can you talk about her strengths compared to the other ones .
looking back at your performance today , any part you would like to go back and improve upon ?
you lost five serves out of eight . once you saved a break with an ace . was n't your serve really the problem today in a way ?
also playing against someone so powerful , there was no way that you could try to change a little bit the pace ? you were hitting both so strong , and then you were missing before .
the question is if you did n't think you could change pace or do something a little different instead of just hitting hard .
we 've been going through an interesting period where the slam winners have been on the older side . do you think this in some way represents a breakthrough ? do you think that younger generation is going to finally step up to slam titles ?
would you consider this a baby step in the comeback getting to the final , or is it a big step ?
do you think you would have made it to the finals without thomas hogstedt this year ?
is it a problem that there 's so few lefties around , and how do you prepare for them ?
has today made you even more determined to win grand slams again ?
after a point , you often go to the back and seem to commune with yourself and have a quiet moment . are you actually thinking about stuff , what am i going to do now ?
so you 're not just getting zen and resting ?
if there was anything you could change about the match today , aside from the outcome , what would that be ?
do you feel like taking a vacation or getting back on court tomorrow ?
did you have any problems in the court with the mosquitoes ?
they 're little bugs .
you 're still only 24. do you consider yourself closer to the younger generation or the older ?
what are your thoughts about petra 's future ? and when the tour is at full strength with kim clijsters and the williams sisters back , where do you think she might fit in ?
obviously there was a lot of excitement at seeing a brand-new champion . did you sense the goodwill there was towards you after the whole injury thing to come back and complete the whole fairytale ?
can you tell us something about fulnek ? what do people do there ? are they farmers ? what is it like ?
how would you describe what you did today and how you pressed the game against sharapova ?
your father seemed to enjoy it . does he always get that excited watching you ?
tell us your feelings at the moment , being a wimbledon champion .
today we feel almost a star is born . are there many grand slams coming your way ?
you looked very quiet and concentrated in this final . how did you prepare for this match yesterday and this morning ?
can you tell us what your plan was going in , what you wanted to do to her , how you wanted to serve to her , go forehand , backhand ?
it looked like you went to the body quite a bit with the serve . is that accurate ?
did you win today for yourself , for your country , for your family , or for everything ?
quite a difference between last year in the semis and this year .
have you spoken to martina or jana yet ?
it meant a lot to you to meet them after the final ?
your match point , you 're 78 feet away from her , looking down at her , what are you thinking ? jeez , i 'm going to be champion ? i better not double-fault ?
what was that feeling when that ace was complete ?
did you sleep well last night ? were you nervous ?
did your father sleep well ?
you 're only the third female champion at wimbledon who is left-handed . can you give us your thoughts about that . does it give you a huge advantage to be a left-hander ?
it 's an advantage purely in the serve or the slice ?
how will you celebrate ? is there any treat you want to buy yourself with the prize money ?
how long will you celebrate for ?
will you go home ?
are you ready for the wimbledon ball , the dress , the makeup ?
will you be dancing a lot ?
what sort of reception do you expect when you go back home ?
i 'm sure they 'll be pleased to see you .
will you be watching the men 's final , and who will you support tomorrow ?
what do you expect from that match ?
what do you think were the biggest reasons that you won today ?
how much of your success today do you think was about your mental stability on the big points and throughout , even though you 're much younger than your opponent - three years - and you do n't have as much experience in these big matches ?
what do you want to do to improve your game ?
we saw a lot of people in your box , father , friends , brothers . there was also boyfriend ?
what is he doing ?
your game suits all kinds of surfaces . you can win on clay , hard court , grass . this is your first grand slam , but not the last , or how do you see this ?
what does your father do , and your family ?
the mayor .
how does it feel to be back in the wimbledon final ?
your start was n't very good .
how much confidence does it give you to be able to come back from that ? looking into the final , do you feel like you have one hand on the trophy after coming back so strong ?
does that give you a lot of confidence going into the final now , turning that game around ?
shoulder surgery is such a scary prospect for tennis players . how difficult of a decision was it for you to have it ? how many opinions did you seek before you decided on it ? did you feel like you had no choice ; it was the last resort ?
what do you remember about your first final here ? is it a blur or can you remember everything quite clearly ?
and how is this feeling different this time ?
your mother was actually on a flight during that final , if i remember . obviously you had trouble getting hold of her .
is she going to come over here to watch ?
sasha is a good free-throw shooter , and sometimes people will say there 's similarities between serving and free-throw shooting .
has he ever offered any advice ?
has he offered you any advice on any tennis stroke , your serve or anything ?
obviously you served quite a few double-faults today . did you worry about them or just think they were going to come and get on with the next point ?
you 're obviously favored to win wimbledon . does that add an extra pressure ?
talk about the quality of experience . how is that an asset ? does it give you a sense of calm ?
did you have any doubt during these three years after your surgery about your comeback ?
do you think you might appreciate it a bit more ? sometimes there 's a danger of taking things for granted .
were you ever at any point close to giving up ?
or did you always think you would be back on top ?
was getting back into this final and winning this title again one of the things that kept you through the dark days ?
you have n't dropped a set in the whole tournament . does that give you a feeling it 's going to be your year again ?
on the flights between l.a. and phoenix , did you ever envision the green lawns here and the possibility of reaching the final ?
yes .
sometimes when you come to a press conference , do you have fun , or you would always like to avoid it ?
what do you expect from your final opponent ?
how much can you take it easy on yourself in matches mentally if you 're not playing well ?
you 're in a match , not playing well , not going well on the day . are you thinking that you ca n't believe you 're playing so bad ? are you kicking your own butt mentally ?
when you give up your serve on a double-fault in the semifinal and then you do it again and then you do it again , potentially that 's a very dispiriting experience . what is the mental process you go through to override that each time ?
how , if at all , has your relationship with your dad changed now that he 's just your dad and not also your coach ?
you said a moment ago that experience is an asset .
i 'm wondering , you won here in 2004 in your first final . can inexperience be an asset , as well ?
when you play , do you find yourself playing for yourself or for your country or your family ? where do you get your inspiration ?
what did you find today was the difference between you and maria ?
do you feel your more to your form you were before you came on crutches ? do you feel you 're nearing your form again ?
what were you most proud of your performance today ?
is this the best of your tennis life so far ?
when do you remember first thinking about wimbledon , and what were your thoughts as a child perhaps ?
what did it make you think about yourself ?
perhaps dreaming of being here yourself one day .
martina won many times . do you remember when ?
how much has martina meant to you ? has she helped you over the years ?
is this the first time you met , just here ?
will you go to her for advice now , how to cope with the pressure of being in a final at wimbledon ?
will you go and ask her some advice , how to cope with it ?
yes .
you are focused on this tournament , on tennis , on now winning the final . is there anything you can tell us about you as a person away from tennis , what your passions are ?
what kind of books do you like ?
when you started the championships , were you confident that you could win wimbledon at the very beginning ?
so this is a surprise for you to be in the final of wimbledon ?
what distracted you more in the first set ? was it the alarm that went off or your opponent 's grunting and groaning ?
what about the alarm that went off ? i think you were just about to serve .
i remember you playing in italy in fed cup . you looked so , so young compared to this girl here going to a final in wimbledon . have you changed something in your culture ? you are more mature now .
what are your thoughts about maria sharapova as a player and her experience coming into a possible final ?
could you tell us a little bit about your serve . you 're left-handed and not afraid to come to the net . is this something you specifically work on as a weapon for yourself or just something that happened because you have a good serve ?
does it give you an advantage today when so many women play from the baseline ? victoria came to the net once or twice during the match . do you feel you have an advantage style-wise today at wimbledon ?
do you work very hard on your serve or is it natural ?
you said that maria has more experience ; she has a win over you . what are you going to have to do on court in the final against her ?
do you think you have any advantages stroke-wise against sharapova ?
what have you enjoyed in watching her over the years ?
are you a natural left-handed , do everything with your left ?
when you 're not playing tennis , what are your hobbies in prague or wherever you live ?
you go to a cinema ? you like dancing ? shopping ? what do you do ? you do n't play tennis , you have three days , what do you do ?
when did your serve get good and how did it get good ?
yes . you said before that your serve was n't so good and you worked a lot on it . when did you do your most work on it and what did you do to make it better ?
what was that ? when did you suddenly develop a good serve ?
are you distracted when you play against noisy opponents ?
how do you block it out ?
did your coach give you a very hard time about your serve ? it strikes me when you were smiling about your serve , you seem to have gone through a lot of agony on your serve . was your coach hard on you ?
on saturday afternoon , what would it mean to you to lift the trophy ?
the three other semifinalists all are from europe but have moved to the united states . you obviously have stayed at home . why have you done that ? did you have any interest at all in moving or are you happy staying put in czech republic ?
did you have any interest at all in moving , as the other three have done ?
to the united states .
as the highest seeded player left in the draw , did you feel a bit of added pressure to get through to the final and win ?
you seem to have turned the match around in the second set . what happened in the third ?
you lost at the french open to the winner of the tournament . do you feel like you 're having bad luck running into women who are playing particularly well at this time ?
is that hard to deal with psychologically for you ?
do you think you 've lost to the winner this time as well ?
do you think she can beat whoever ?
did any of her game surprise you ?
serving while behind for a place in a wimbledon final , is it a difficult assignment ? were you nervous in that last game ?
did the noise of the alarm going off in the first set , did that have an effect on you ?
having gotten so close to the final , you do n't seem particularly disappointed . what are you feeling right now ?
what would your grandmother say to you after a match like this ?
you won your first wta title after several finals . maybe it 's just your way to go to the majors , step by step . what do you think about that ?
does it make it a bit more agonizing , the fact that you got into your first slam semifinal and you were so close to getting into your first final ? does this make it a bit harder to take than any of the defeats before ?
what in your mind was the difference in the match ? and what 's missing in your game from taking it all the way at a big tournament like this ?
as quarterfinals go , that was a pretty impressive performance from you .
six service breaks is pretty remarkable .
how much of your service action do you think you 've got back since the surgery ? in terms of percentage , where would you say you are ?
do you feel completely free with it now ?
sabine has been a surprise package of this tournament . you 'll need to be at full throttle to beat her in the semis , wo n't you ?
do you feel as if you just have gotten better every match ? how much better can you play than you did today ?
does it help having been to the later stages before ? does it feel like a long time ago when you did it ?
you have been at this stage the last two slams . on clay does it still feel like an experiment when you 're out there , and here it feels like this is where you expect to be ?
here how do you feel ?
you 've been at this stage .

has it been a growth process for you ?
what is the difference between a coach and a father ? you have been through both .
the williams have a father ; bartoli has a father ; lisicki has a father ; dementieva has a father ; capriati , father ...
you are the only one that changed recently from a father to a coach . can you tell us what is the difference , and was it your choice or your father 's choice ?
but if they do n't know tennis ...
you 've had years of experience . do you think lifting a grand slam trophy would somehow have more meaning or a different meaning than the ones before ?
what 's it like to walk into this club as a former champion ? any special treatments ?
coming off the shoulder surgery , you talked about the difficulties and wondering about playing tennis level and playing at a top level . how long did those doubts linger for you ? can you point to a moment when you said , here i am again ?
sabine has a terrific serve . your groundstrokes today were crisp and flat . do you expect the semis will be a question of power more than finesse ?
looking back at the french open semifinal , any thoughts about it after a while , thinking about what happened ?
that was a powerful performance . you must have felt like all the pieces came together today .
what were you feeling at the end of the second set ? did you feel like maybe you had missed your chance ?
were you getting any problems from your leg or ankle ? the tv mentioned it looked like you were tightening up a bit .
what did you tell yourself at the end of the second ? you hit a rough patch . are you thinking you really have to go after her aggressively ? did you expect her level to drop a little ? she must have felt pretty elevated after winning the second .

can you talk a little bit about that , what it actually was , what you were told it was . did that set you back ?
how many months do you think it set you back ?
how do you see the next round , the semifinal ?
it 's a big opponent , previous winner .
it just finished .
forgetting your opponents , what do you think you 'll need to do to win here in terms of feeling comfortable , that if i do this , i 've done everything i can ?
do you remember where you were when maria won wimbledon in 2004 ? did you watch it ?
so can you just talk about your impressions of her as a player .
has steffi graf offered any kind of tips or advice over the months you 've known her that 's helped you to get to where you are now ?
how difficult was it to concentrate out there with all the thunder ?
do you think a game like that - the crowd got involved - might mean they might be more minded to support you on thursday as you 're a new face to them , that they might have taken you to their hearts a little bit because of the way you battled away ?
did you expect that from english fans , to get behind you ?
could you talk about how it feels , the freedom of being a wild card , how that actually sort of makes your game different .
is there added enjoyment because you 're a wild card with no expectations at all ?

what are your thoughts on the way that game went ?
why did you become nervous in that second set ?
having got through that match , are you confident you can reach the final this year ?

what do you think you 'll learn the most from last year that will help you this year ?
do you think inside you can lift the trophy on saturday ?
your opponent said if she beat you she hoped to make the news in bulgaria . how will news of your victory here be greeted back in the czech republic ?

do you feel it would have been any different with the roof open ?
how difficult was it to concentrate when you had the thunder , the rain so loud ? the umpire had to shout at some point to be heard .
how important is it to hear the sound in a match ? have you ever played in a situation like this where there was so much noise from the elements ?
do you feel like the amount she used the dropshot in the match , which was unusually high , did that play a part in you losing energy a little bit as the match wore on ?
you said you hate even losing a game of monopoly to your brother . how will you be tonight ? what is your mood going to be tonight ?
do you get upset when people say the women 's game does n't have many stars , because that was an excellent game ? do you feel there 's a lot of talent in the women 's gave perhaps not being recognized at the moment ?
during your run to the final here a while back , you had that great win over justine ; the other day you beat serena . how would you compare those two wins ? which was more special ?
you talk about running out of gas . you were always on the moving from place to place and whacking your racquet . did that slow you down or was that pumping yourself up ?
after serena yesterday , did you see yourself as going all the way to the finals ?
do you think sabine 's game plan was in a certain way in that direction , exhausting you , making you run , making you move a lot on the court ?

would you say that 's the best tennis you 've played so far ?
how was it coping with moving from court 1 to centre ?
how did you feel yourself today , change of conditions ? yesterday was too hot ; now it 's a little colder . you had some problems in the last years with health in hot weather .

what are the qualities of tamira 's game ?
are you surprised this is the best you 've done at a grand slam ?
you lost the last two games against kvitova . is it important before the semifinals ?
how much involvement did your parents have in your tennis ?
so when you were young , is she the one who took you to tournaments , to practice , and all of that ?
at what point were they comfortable saying you could go to a coach , you can go to america ? a lot of parents wo n't do that .
last year you got knocked out by kvitova and then you went on and reached more quarterfinals in slams . do you feel a lot more confident now that you can beat her ?
if you were to obviously get through to the final , what would that mean to you ?
do you like playing lefties or not ?
does the grunting give you a good feeling on the exhalation ? does it give you a rhythm ? a fight ? how does it help you ?
seles was once sort of pressurized into holding back her grunt during a final here and lost and regretted that . have you ever tried to repress it ? does it affect the way you play ?
when you were 12 and your mother sent you away , how hard was that on you ?
is it more difficult to play kvitova on grass than other surfaces ?
yes .
do you think the grass became slower than last years ?
what changed in march ? you said you 've taken a different approach since then .
what triggered that ?
looks very quiet during this tournament . no nervous . no something on court , emotion . it 's a new style of your play or something else ?
what did your grandmother say to you ?
more interesting .
what was she doing when she was working ?
you said your mother laughed when you told her you were going to study ?
how come ?
she could tell with your mood that you were basically just in a place where you were saying you were frustrated but a week or two you were going to go back to what you really love ?
first set was obviously great . what happened after that ?
is that how you see it , you let it slip and get away from you ?
what was the effect of the heat out there ? there were a lot of long rallies . you seemed to be getting winded . was the heat a factor ?
is she an awkward opponent for you to play ? you played her several times before with a good record .
you say you should have taken advantage of your chances . what do you feel held you back from that today ?
anytime the no.1 loses before the semis and finals , people start talking about what it means . how do you sort of see that in terms of where you are at the top and what it means for you going forward ?
is there anything in particular you 're going to be working on over the next couple months after you 've had a rest ?
it was almost a game of two phases .
were you surprised at the second set , comparatively easy , get out of the heat ?
where do you place your form and fitness now ? what level are you ?
given the fact that thomas worked with our national team in china for a few years , do you think you might have some advantage in terms of preparation ?
was something being said to you in her box ? was someone heckling ? the tall man , you looked right at him after the match .
you had talked about the advantage of sasha being a pro athlete . is it really manifest on match days , that he knows you need to be so focused , almost be a different person than you are on off days ? maybe someone who is n't in sports would n't appreciate the personality change that happens ?
could you just talk about movement . it looks like now or the last few months you 're moving about as well as you ever had . you 're getting to balls that you did n't used to and doing something with it .
is there something happening with your right leg ?
have you got any superstitions before a match ? do you put one trainer on before the other one , anything like that ?
when vladimir got to the semis here a decade or so ago , he watched gladiator before every match . he has n't got you watching the same film ?
with the embolism that serena had , there 's talk of she 's just lucky to be alive .
i know you 've spoken to your family about chernobyl , getting out of there . do you ever reflect on that that you were lucky to emerge from there ?
all this by hitting a yellow ball ?
you talked about your team being stable , sasha here , your movement . is this the best you 've felt at this stage of the tournament since like 2006 , would you say ?
is anything less than a title here a satisfying result for you ?
what do you feel you need to focus on to improve for the next match ?
can you describe a little bit more what the challenge is when you play her . you have n't played yet on grass , but you have a pretty even head-to-head so far , and she 's taken a couple against you on hard courts recently .
how would you describe the difference , obviously it 's a pronounced one , in your styles and in your games ?
you played a lot of steady players and have beaten them before . is she just more steady ? does she run faster ? is she deceptively good in certain areas ? what makes her a no.1-type player without overwhelming weapons ?
you 're not surprised ? it 's easy for you to beat venus williams all the time ?
what is the difference with the other wins ? were you more prepared mentally to do it , also because she is not in the best shape or not ?
how do you explain the fact you had won only four matches in the circuit this year ? why do you suddenly start playing so well ?
you were not injured before ?
sometimes players get the idea of how other players play . is something like that happen between you and venus ?
last year i met some of your relatives in wimbledon . you had a lot of family around . how many people are there this year ?
do you all still live in plovdiv ?
can you tell us something about that city and the relationship with tennis . who else has ever been a tennis player from plovdiv , men or women ?
who is coaching you ?
do you think this is very normal ? bartoli has the father . a lot of players , especially women , have the father as coach . the williams have a father who does n't play tennis . your father was a tennis player ?
do n't you think it 's a bit strange , all these fathers becoming international coaches , the daughters become extraordinary athletes and champions ? it means you do n't need to be so technically prepared to become a good coach . because even in the past , seles , graf ...
so you do n't need to be a great strategist ?
all the parents ?
the beginning of the tournament it was said that serena being a favorite was an indictment of the woman 's tour because she has been away from the game so long . venus the same . have you seen her out of shape , not as good as she was last time around ? what do you think about the argument that it 's better for you that they are not going farther into the tournament ?
both of them . particularly the case was made of serena being the favorite of the tournament after 11 months away from the game .
venus today was a good as ever ?
why are there no bulgarian journalists ?
what are your thoughts about the level of your game and the opportunity that you have ahead ?
if it 's serena williams in the next round , what do you take from the match that you played here against her two years ago , and how would you describe the challenge for you ?
what 's your level of excitement to be this far at wimbledon ?
shortly after that injury , would this have seemed possible to you ?
yeah .
will you tackle sharapova in exactly the same way you did wozniacki in the second and third sets ?
you went for everything today , did n't you ? no holding back on any shot .
i think right after the second set they flashed the marion bartoli upset on the board . did you see that ? were you able to take anything from it ?
can you talk about the atmosphere ? seemed as if the crowd was behind you .
do you think it was a bit of an advantage for you that you were n't on centre court or court 1 ?
was it hot ?
wozniacki is the world no.1 . do you think she does n't have the aura of previous no.1s before , like when serena was no.1 ?
does she have less than an aura of sharapova , particularly here at wimbledon ?
i believe this is the first time in 100 years when all the women 's quarterfinalists are from europe . what do you make of that ?
will you be happy to go on centre court tomorrow ?
if you were ranking your previous victories , where would you put this one ?
having beaten the reigning champion , do you feel you can go all the way to the final now ?
you played three wonderful matches . which one have you been suffering the most and which do you think has been the best ?
those three match points ...
what do you think of serena 's level at this point considering all she 's been through in the last year ?
compared to the other top players .
what about your own serving ? it was pretty good today .
your fist pumping and bouncing were entertaining the crowd an awful lot . tell us what that does for you as motivation .
you had your problems with your parents . i heard you on the tv earlier apologize to them . what does that tell us about your personality ?
could you explain why you have these rituals before your serve and return ?
you bounce the ball four times . why not three or five ?
when you win a big match in a tournament , then win another in the same tournament , how does that affect your confidence ? does that give you more confidence and the feeling you might go deep into a tournament ?
on a scale of 1 to 10 , how would you describe how you played today ?
what do you think you can improve on ?
you have n't dropped a set yet . who needs grass court preparation ?
you have a good record on grass .
after you lost at roland garros , you said , i guarantee i 'm going to play better at wimbledon . can you just talk about why you said it , what the emotion was , then backing it up with your play ?
when you took the mental break , how were you able to turn yourself off of the tennis ?
which matches did you see of the football matches ? have you had any good-luck messages from liverpool players ?
the liverpool players are not getting in touch with you ?
which ones ?
i do n't think they 're going to be too offended .
it 's been a little while since you had that fun press conference in melbourne where you interviewed yourself . could you talk about the role of the press , what kind of job you think the media does in terms of covering tennis , interesting questions , not so interesting questions ?
if your media bosses back in monaco ask you to ask yourself a really interesting question , what would you ask caroline ?
can you talk about your next opponent , what sort of history you have .
cibulkova .
do you think this could be the big one for you here this year ?
jarmila 's game today , she was very aggressive today ?
what is your relationship with maria sharapova , and what do you think the potential might be for a rivalry on the court between the two of you ?
you 're known for being very consistent , making very few unforced errors this week . looks like you 're going for more on your serve . is that something you 're going to have to do in the second week ?
so it 's something you 're consciously doing ?
best you played here ?
just talk about the match overall , what you thought went well for you .
is your serve returning a little bit ? did it pack itself in its luggage and come today ?
did you hit a particular ace or was there a particular point ?
you talked after your first couple matches about that tight feeling . now you say you do n't feel that way today . what made the difference ?
how is your body holding up ?
so you were tight because you were worried that your game would n't come back , or you were worried you could get hurt again ?
you 've been in the spotlight for so many years . what are your feelings about the job the media does ? are they fair ? do they take things out of context ?
what are the hurdles mentally to competing after you 've not been competing for a year ? is it hard to get the mental edge in your head back , too ?
what does marion provide , challenge-wise ?
you 've been to the second week of so many slams . looking back to what happened over the past year , going into tomorrow you get the day off , probably nice you made it to this stage , huh ?
sort of like you fell off your bicycle and you 're back on . talk about that process of getting back in the groove . is it weird ? what is the process like for you ?
can you compare how you 're feeling and how you 're playing this year to maybe last year and previous years when you won ?
the local bookmakers still make you a very strong favorite . do you find that surprising ?
did you say you literally fell off a bicycle sometime in the last year ?
details , please .
this is in l.a. ?
did you really get cut ?
that did n't affect the shoulder ?
what kind of bike did you have ?
when you 're going down , what is going through your head ?
have you ridden since then ?
when you were in last time you were talking about court placement .
you were asking about whether or not there was a reason that you and venus were placed there . ever since you 've been gone , players have been talking about the idea of women not being placed on the show courts . what further thoughts have you had on it ?
when was your bike accident ?
you were riding the bike with your bad foot in october , like in a cast ?
you 're the world 's champion of tennis , the glass comes crashing down on you in germany . what did you think ? oh , my god , what 's next ?
so being put on court 2 does n't look so bad ?
you said an ambulance just happened to be going by . did you just like hail it ?
venus yesterday said she 's like a lot more confident than she was a year ago . do you see that in her ?
why do you think that happened ?
you mentioned this very bad month . what 's the single best thing that 's happened to you since then ?
you made the semis here in '05 and '06 . are you surprised that you 're the favorite to win the tournament this year ?
how would you sum up the first week ? how well do you think you 're playing ? do you feel you need to improve to get to this stage next week ?
are you satisfied with how you 've played so far ?
you 're moving on now to meet china 's peng shuai . do you think you can beat her ?
how quickly do you think the match will last ?
does every girl need a basketball player ?
on a more serious note .
it 's pretty extraordinary that your fianc is such a great athlete in a totally different sport . talk about that . you must have learned some things about basketball that have been interesting in terms of your own performance . talk about what you 've learned from being around sasha so much .
why is it harder to watch a big game ?
on the flipside of that , last year he was with the lakers , they go deep in the playoffs . this year he 's with you throughout the clay court season , here . does that help at all , the stability of it , having him there ?
with the team itself , it 's not all new , but it 's kind of stabilized . thomas you 've been with five or six months . cecil is hitting with you . the physio is with you full-time . talk about that .
talk about how much that 's helped get the team set , how comfortable you are with it . does that reflect in your play ?
how was court no.2 ? does it make any difference materially , your surroundings , to your game ?
in terms of your confidence and all the time since your injury struggles , where is it right now and how has it evolved to that point ?
you have a day off now . what do you intend to do with it ?
will you go out into wimbledon village ?
you played a left-hander yesterday . there are a few remaining in the draw . what unique challenge does that pose for you ?
with the williams sisters having been out for so long coming into this tournament , does that put extra pressure on players like yourself ?
do you have any memories of this time , going into the second week , in 2004 ? is the only thing you remember the win in the final ? do you remember what you were thinking or how you were feeling ?
what did you feel went wrong for you today ? you seemed in control at a lot of points in the game .
and in the final set ?
so you need more killer instinct , is that the bottom line ?
calmer mentally this time , though . no arguments with umpires about anything today ?
and he did it well today , right ?
you did n't seem to have too much faith in hawk-eye at one point .
you argued and said it was out even after hawk-eye , did n't you ?
looked out to us as well .
what do you make of your result today ?
was she a bit too polished today do you think for you ?
do you feel like you 're getting closer to these top 10 girls ?
what do you think it needs to get those ten points ?
do you think caroline will win wimbledon ?
how was that occasion for you today ?
is she any more difficult or easy to play against on grass ?
after that , sort of obviously you 've got doubles and other things . but the us open , how did you look to that ?
what 's next ?
how old were you when you became australian ?
yeah , like '09 .
you got a rankings goal to the end of the year ?
did anyone ever try to turn you into a right-hander since left-handedness is so rare ?
and it is your natural ?
how did you turn that around ?
were you surprised she was able to play that well on grass ? obviously with you , you 've done very well on grass , but it 's not like it 's her favorite surface .
tell us about fighting against your health .
i know your dad 's been a huge help to you in your career , but did it help when he left this time ?
i was n't there and did n't see it . did you speak to them or did you gesture ?
did you actually say anything , or was it just , go away ?
did you just want them not to be there for a particular reason ?
where did your dad watch ?
if your dad said it was the best match he ever saw you play , maybe did he then say , maybe i should watch the next one on tv ?
you know serena , and it looked like she played well today . i would think that 's going to be a step up on monday .
since tomorrow is an off day , just talk about the challenges she presents overall , what makes her so tough .
your mom does n't watch because she gets too nervous ; is that correct ?
you 're obviously the world no.1 . how do you feel about playing on court no.2 ? serena williams was n't content with it yesterday .
i suppose the fans would like to see the best on the best courts .
you would n't see nadal as men 's no.1 playing on court 2. you have been no.1 for almost the whole of the year .
on your second match point , that ball just seemingly fell from the sky . what was your vantage point on that ?
you won on the fifth match point . the four other match points , did she play too well on them ?
a slow burner for you this tournament so far . almost like you 've not been here for most of the week . how difficult has that been with the rain delays , getting postponed yesterday ?
is it hard to assess your form when you have a long gap between matches ?
how would you describe how grass is suited for your game ? we 're used to many of the big players who are very offensive taking charge on grass . how does your game fit with the grass ?
what are your thoughts on your next opponent ?
did you have any fears on court 2 with bad memories from last year ?
when you saw you were playing on court 2 , you did n't think , uh-oh ?
what are your thoughts on sabine and her success so far here ?
does grass give you the best chance of winning a slam of the four majors ?
do you feel you need to win a major to validate yourself in terms of the ranking ? consistency clearly is there . for the public to realize the quality of your game , does that need a trophy validation ?
you do n't put any extra pressure on yourself at these events because of that ?
when did you first dream of being a wimbledon champion and what were those images , if you can remember ?
did you grow up watching this tournament on the tv at home ?
do you remember which players you watched then ?
does it feel different here to other tournaments because of the grass and the tradition ? do you sense something out of ordinary ?
most men 's matches , the great champions do n't play on court 2 , but that 's because centre court , they always have two men 's matches and one women 's matches . is there much talk amongst the girls about that ?
one time .
do you feel the women should some days have two matches on centre court ?
when you were starting as a professional , which did you think would be harder to achieve , becoming no.1 or winning a major ? how have things played out in your mind at least ?
( question regarding steven gerrard and team sports . )
could you tell us a little bit about the importance of having both your father and your brother here ? when you discuss and analyze your play so far , what is your father telling you about the progress ?
was it tough playing an opponent with a tragic situation in her private life recently ? was that on your mind at all ? did you say anything to her at the end of the match ?
seemed like you came out with a plan , executed , you took away the net . just talk about how you feel about performance .
to what degree do you feel you 're progressing the way you normally do when you do well here ?
you 're saying regardless of how you play and practice for a couple days , you really have no idea how you 're going to perform in a match ?
you were saying at eastbourne you do n't feel there 's any pressure on you this year . is that right ? the only pressure you can put on is yourself ?
your sister was quite outspoken yesterday about being made to play on court 2. do you agree with her comments ?
you do n't mind playing on court 2 ?
there 's a perception that it 's the women . you 're a multiple champion , and serena is a multiple champion . you would n't get that on the men 's game .
you obviously did n't grow up on grass . but watching you move on it , sometimes it seems like you move on it much more easily than anywhere else . do you find that ?
so health-wise , it looked like a couple times today you were fiddling with your hip . was that just the dress ?
stitched it the wrong way ?
you 're known almost as well as your style choices on court . what inspires your fashion sense ?
you play pironkova in the next round . she knocked you out last year . you might not want to talk about revenge , but ...
do you feel a lot more confident as well ?
what are her biggest strengths ?
when you have n't been competing that much , do you have to force yourself to focus more ? does it not come naturally ?
you wo n't have seen it , but one of the home favorites , laura robson , she took maria sharapova close today . serena was talking yesterday that she was a big prospect . have you seen anything of her ?
there 's a perception there are going to be a lot of expectations on her . what sort of advice would you give her to make sure she blossoms into a star ?
why do n't you use hawk-eye more ? do you forget to use it ?
you use it a lot less than a lot of players .
unless you think it 's way , way out , definitively the wrong call is made , you 're going to move on ?
how are you going to relax for the next couple of days and get ready for monday ?
how is it different ? do you find it a lot different when you have two days off ?
what are your thoughts on sabine lisicki ? what are your observations of the way she plays at this point in her career ?
how do you feel you played ?
what were your overall impressions of her performance ?
what kind of potential ?
what for you is the biggest challenge on your serve right now ? what 's the difference between when it 's really on and when it 's troublesome ?
is there a technical difference that you can point us to when things are going well and the first serve is where you want it and then when it has its lapses ?
in paris you mentioned how you liked to observe as you travel around the world . could you just compare the show court crowds in the three different countries when you 've played these kids ?
and paris ?
was the match tougher than you expected today ?
you just mentioned you 're a veteran of the tour . how does it feel to be a veteran ? is there any trace of your teenage player self that you 'd like back ?
would you have one little nugget of advice for laura who is just starting out on her pro career ?
how did they compare to maria sharapova when you were 17 ?
you left europe , and now we see this continent is dominating both tours . why do you think that is ?
there were some comments made on the television about how loud you were when you were hitting the ball today .
do you think you were noticeably louder than you have been in the past , and do you think it 's off-putting for your opponent ?
you talked about learning . could you talk about how your mental toughness has evolved over the years since you were a younger player ? is that something you 've worked on ?
you 're a former champion here . do you think the williams sisters or women in general have a legitimate beef with some of the court placement ?
they 've complained about being out on court 2. maybe some of the former champions are not being placed on some of the show courts .
i 'm saying the williams sisters . in general , do you feel they have a legitimate beef about that or the women are n't getting the proper placement ?
laura robson obviously gained some experience playing you today . do you think there 's anything you 've learnt from the match ?
what are your overriding emotions after the singles match ? are you proud and encouraged by pushing her so close or whether it 's ultimately disappointment ?
she said one of the key stages in your development will be to go back to the challenger circuit and win those tight games there . is that difficult to do after having played on a stage like today ?
was there anything about her game that surprised you in terms of the pace of the ball or what there was on the ball ?
what do you feel about sharapova 's grunting ? we had a gruntometer in the court .
it is if you work for the sun . she was the loudest she 's ever been . does it put you off your game ? do you find it distracting ?
you 've now played some pretty big players . how did sharapova compare to the other big names you 've played ?
does meeting lots of different players like that help when you go back down to a lower level ?
what will your next singles tournament be ?
did maria speak to you afterwards or have any words of encouragement ?
did nerves play a part today ?
in terms of learning , how quickly can you learn ? if you were to play her again tomorrow , would you have already learnt a lot of lessons from today that you could put into practice tomorrow ?
what areas do you feel your game needs to improve in and what are you going to start working on specifically in the coming months ?
what were you thinking when it was 4-1 in the first ? were you a bit surprised to be there or were you anticipating her coming back ?
i recall last year i think you said you did n't get your hands on your prize money at all . a year on , has that changed ?
you got a raise in your pocket money ?
last year you had just finished your gcses . are you trying to combine doing the tennis full-time and a levels , or are you going to focus on the tennis at the moment ?
are you going to take a levels next year ? is that the plan ?
which ones are you hoping to take ?
can you explain the situation behind your parting with patrick ? and also , what do you plan to do now with your coaching situation ?
how much of that is confidence in yourself ?
were you homesick in paris ? did that have an effect , not seeing your siblings , mum and dad ?
what went wrong today ?
because you looked like you had it back in the second .
4-2 up third set , you must have thought you were in with a good chance .
what particularly pleased you about your performance ? some of your returning was great .
where do you think this improvement can lead you ?
as the more senior figure in british women 's tennis , what is your sense of the improved quality that we 've seen from laura and heather this week ?
in terms of their match temperament , how do you think that 's developing ?
do you feel you 're playing your best tennis ever ?
do you think you 're close to reaching your peak ?
were you able to totally blank out the laura robson and sharapova noise ?
laura proved herself well against sharapova . how good do you think she can become ?
as british no.1 , would n't it have been nice to be on centre court or no.1 ?
you had deuce in the final game . were you worried at all when you stopped then ? what was going through your head at that point ?
yes .
after a lot of points you would turn and face the outer court . was that just to collect your thoughts ?
what are those key words ?
have you been doing that for a while ?
how did that come about ? were you advised to do that ?
can you talk to us about jack marshall ?
what do you make of being put on court no.2 today ?
i remember the last couple years you 've said , okay , it 's court 2 , i 'll play .
in the first set , you seemed to have a hard time reading her serve or making any impression on her serve . what was bothering you about it in the first set and what did you figure out about it after that ?
was it frustrating to not even get a breakpoint chance in that first set ?
can you just explain what it is about court no.2 that makes playing difficult ? is it noise ? is it atmosphere ?
you have to go through the crowds , do n't you ?
this was only your fourth match total since you came back . are you playing your way into shape , feeling better each match ? or does the first set in each match drive you crazy ?
you and venus almost look at it as an insult that you 're not automatically put on centre , 1 , like djokovic , nadal .
do you think in any way it could relate to you and venus , you 're bigger than life , you speak your mind , you 're big personalities ? do you think that relates to it at all in any way ?
what is your reaction when you find out the next day 's play ? do you say , oh , no , that you 're going to be out there ?
this is a unique tournament where a lot of the players , including yourself , stay here in the village and rent people 's homes . what is the advantage and disadvantage of doing that ?
some of the houses are n't quite as modern , as we 're used to in the states with weird kind of showers or washing machines . have you had any disasters ?
a year ago , you just won the championships , you 're about to go to a big exhibition in belgium , you go to germany and you have the accident with the glass . you talked about your deepening spiritual experience . what are your thoughts on why that happened ?
do you view it as bad luck or just unfortunate or what ?
do you feel like you 're starting slowly in your matches and is that a function of not playing a lot ? how do you feel your level was by the third set ?
by the third set , how did you feel you were playing ?
what sort of appreciation do you have , maybe greater than ever , for roger federer 's streak of playing in about 12 years straight of majors without missing any , based on the struggles that you 've had with your health ?
can i ask your impressions of laura robson who won her first match at wimbledon at the age of 17 , how you dealt with the pressure at 17 coming on tour .
if you were 17 and you were going in against maria , what would your approach be ?
you have maria kirilenko best . what is the key against her ?
back to laura , how did you cope as a 17-year-old when you first came on tour ? you obviously had your family support .
how big a step is it to come from 250 into the top 50 , which is probably laura 's objective for the next year ?
you 're known for your sense of fight , mental toughness . aside from venus , whose mental toughness in tennis has impressed you ?
as you pointed out , you won a grand slam at 17. now it seems like the players are getting older when they 're doing better on the wta tour . any thoughts in your mind why that change ?
how are you feeling today ?
how do you like the new court no.3 ?
what does that mean to you after everything you 've been through ?
you certainly did it the hard way , did n't you ?
did you ever think you would get back to this kind of stage ?
what was it like , those days last year ?
accounting for the tears at the end ?
obviously your serve is such a huge weapon . do you feel that makes you a very dangerous player on grass ?
what goes through your head at that moment when you know it 's 15-40 ? are you trying to get the service winner straight off or trying to play more the percentages ?
li na 's coach said your serve was so powerful , it sort of seemed like a man 's serve . would you like to comment on that ?
do you know anything about misaki doi ?
you 're not too bothered you 've upset 1.4 billion people ?
you must be confident that you can have another sort of really good run here now ?
the french open was obviously very tough for you as well . great to come out on top of a really tight match today .
you 've been through a few dramas in the last couple weeks , the birmingham title , finding out you had a wild card . you must feel like you 've earned your wild card now .
how tired are you in your mind ?
can you tell us what went wrong .
the wrong result . you almost had it , did n't you ?
was your mental strength there , determination , your famous drive ?
has she got one of the best serves you 've faced ? your coach said to me , she serves like a man .
how different was it for you coming in here as the french open champion for the first time , as a grand slam winner , obviously a lot more attention from china ? was that a difference here playing at wimbledon ?
did the fact that your husband left halfway through the second set , did that affect you ?
years from now , back in china , when you are an old woman ...
years from now , your friends say to you , how was your trip to europe in 2011 , what will you say to them ?
what are you looking forward to at this moment ?
and tomorrow ?
you 're going back to china ?
what greeting do you want to have when you get there ?
what message are you taking back to china ?
in this country we get very excited every time andy murray plays at wimbledon . britain is a country of 60 million people . can you tell us what it is like to carry the hopes of 700 million people back in china ?
what lesson do you want the children of china to take from your adventures over the last weeks and months ?
there 's a positive message for them , is n't there ?
do you expect a good reception when you go back to the airport ?
are there lots more grand slam champions to come from china ? will you be the standard bearer for a long procession of chinese champions from now on ?
will there be lots more grand slam champions out of china in tennis now , do you think ?
why is there such a difference between the men and the chinese women ?
what 's the problem with the men ? lazy ?
are you telling the chinese men to work harder ?
what do you like to do when you 're not playing tennis ? do you like fashion ? what do you like to do ?
but do you like shopping , going to theater , see movie ?
what do you like to shop ?
how did your coach mortensen help you the most , your coach ?
will you continue to work with him or do n't you know ?
when you wake up at 3:00 in the morning and you remember this match today , are there going to be any moments where you think , if only i 'd done that ?
i hope you find your husband .
were you looking at those big black clouds and thinking , i want to get out of here before the rain comes down ?
you seem so confident on the grass . what is it about wimbledon that inspires you to play well ?
when is the last time you 've lost four games in your first two matches at a tournament ?
so why are you playing well ?
this is the first time we 've seen you with this black square-shaped racquet . can you tell us about it and why you 've chosen that ?
and unusual shape , obviously ?
who 's created the structure you 're talking about ? is that you ? you 're sort of in between coaches again . is it you , the hitting partner , or ...
did n't you say recently , though , that you were happy not to have a full-time coach ? i read a couple weeks ago that now you 're looking for a full-time coach again , or was that wrong ?
you said your racquet gave you a softer feel . could you talk a little bit more about that . is that control ?
and in the past you 've had some interesting comments on what you 've been reading . what have you been reading recently ?
what do you think of your next match against petkovic ?
which murakami book are you reading ?
have you thought about working with sven again , or is he spending too much time with caroline ?
is it kind of nice being your own boss ?
have you gotten your strength , fitness , muscle , back to where you want it now ?
so what are you bench pressing ?
i guess you 're pretty happy to be in the third round . how much have you been inspired by kimiko ?
did you have the chance to watch her match yesterday ?
was there a point in the match that you thought you would n't come off with a win ? if so , when was it ?
you seemed to be struggling with your toss a little bit . kimiko said it may have been a strategy on your part , that you were looking to see whether she was going left or right . is that at all the case out there ?
can you believe how well she did at her age ?
you never played her before . was it quite a surprise the way she plays ?
how tough is it going to be for you to recover from this in time for your next match ?
you mentioned kimiko had some luck on those let cords . can you talk a little bit about luck in our sport .
can you think of a really fortunate situation in your career where the ball bounced the right way ?
do you think that today proves if you 're fit enough and stay injury-free you can play top-level tennis at 40 ? would you like to be playing tennis at 40 ?
you 've spoken a lot about her game . what about your game today ? what were the best parts and the worst parts in your progression ?
everybody is talking about her age . back to oakland , when you entered pro tennis , which seems like a million years ago , do you ever feel your age ? do you ever think back to that first match at all ?
as both a sister and as a tennis player , what do you think serena showed to us yesterday ?
what was your reaction to her emotions that she showed publicly ? very unusual for her .
the wimbledon homepage did an online survey yesterday who was the best-looking male player who played wimbledon in history . who would have gotten your vote ?
how did you feel conditions were affected by the roof being closed ?
during serena 's toughest moments , what were your reflections ?
when you and serena were young girls , who cried the most ? can you remember any reasons why ?
what have you learned about your game in the first two rounds here , given your mostly layoff this past year ?
and how about the level of your game ? have you made any discoveries about where you are ?
andy roddick mentioned yesterday some of the greatest players of all time are that great because they hate losing so much . which kind of feeling is more powerful , is it the hate of losing or the love of winning ?
who has the quirkiest , most unusual game you 've ever faced ? kimiko , bartoli , seles ?
you came on the scene as a junior , a very interesting time in american tennis . who are some of the juniors you and serena were talking about that you lost track of them ?
you were speaking a minute ago about the emotions of winning and losing . if this turned out to be a loss , even against a tough and unusual player , what would it have meant to you ?
you mentioned your love of the olympics . today is a big day because fans find out which tickets they got in the ballots . apart from tennis , what would you like to see at the london olympics ?
looked like you were wincing on occasion . can you explain how tricky it was , your injury , out there .
so you would n't blame the injury then ?
when did you first feel it ?
but you had n't lost your serve before then , had you ? was that when you were broken for the first time ?
have you had a diagnosis ?
do you feel you would have won there had it not happened ? because you were in a pretty good place .
is it just a coincidence that until then you were probably the most powerful player on the court , and then after you were injured she became the most powerful player on the court ?
have you experienced it before ?
you 've had such a good year . did you fancy your chances beforehand ?
you must have believed in yourself even more after that first set because you played really well .
because of the way that it ended , the importance of wimbledon to you , is this sort of the hardest defeat you 've had to take since you turned professional ?
you 're very brave in the fact that you could have used the elbow as an excuse .
even though you did n't have any physical pain after whatever medication it was , are you saying it was at the back of your mind for the rest of the match ? even though you could n't feel it , your concentration was somehow distracted by it ?
so you had to play within yourself on serve then ?
you 're saying you should have been more aggressive . i do n't know if it helps you . i was sitting next to nick bollettieri , and he actually said , what a fighter . that 's something . you were proving something to your coach . if you have fight , all you need to do then is go on from there .
you proved it in the second game where you saved seven breakpoints .
if your injury has n't happened before , are you now thinking , why me ? of all the times for it to suddenly come about . are you feeling a bit , why me , at the moment ?
your body of work in the past month , you must feel like you feel in the top 100 , top 50 ?
i suspect your mom put her arm around you and told you not to be too hard on yourself ?
and said not to worry too much ?
what happens now ? if the injury is not too bad , presumably it 's full steam ahead for the us open , is it ?
i know it might be a scant consolation . but rio ferdinand has been tweeting about you , saying he was impressed with the guts that you showed . what 's your reaction to that ?
you 're not a manchester united supporter ?
that 's cheered you up .
a big smile .
what do you think made the difference out there today ?
you showed a lot of guts in difficult situations , did n't you ?
did the injury break in the third set knock you off your stride a little bit ?
no real form coming in here , no coach . what on earth has happened to you ?
what actually is the coaching situation ?
how do you feel physically ? you shot up so much . you 've had growing pains to go with that ?
how tall are you ?
and what were you five months ago ?
talk us through the last 12 months in terms of the niggles you 've had , your form . how would you assess it all ?
when did you last feel you hit the ball as consistently well in a competitive match as you did today ?
was there any frustration that you took out on your opponent today because you had to wait so long yesterday and never got on court and then changed courts today ? was there any frustration being unleashed ?
did the intimate atmosphere help you ?
do you know who they are ?
how important will it be to completely forget about this match today in terms of the very difficult one you have tomorrow ?
good account of yourself her in the past against jankovic and hantuchova . any reason you should n't give sharapova at least a run for her money tomorrow ?
but you played well in both those matches .
this is only your third grand slam main draw match . do you think even without all the difficulties you 've had this year you would still consider that a reasonably good success rate , to win your third main draw grand slam match ?
will it be nice to be back on court no.1 where you won the junior title three years ago ?
do you think you can beat sharapova ?
it was long time ago now , but do you have any memories of her winning the title here ? can you remember watching it ?
i think you misunderstood . the day maria won the women 's title here , were you here or watching ?
thinking about your game plan , you 're playing a girl 248 places above you in the world rankings , the fifth seed . what sort of game plan do you take against that sort of opposition ?
you 've grown physically . i think a lot of people will be pleased with how you 've grown in stature mentally . you 're sounding very confident . your supporters will be pleased with that . do you feel that ?
bad luck , bethanie .
you came back , and then seemed to just slip away at the end .
we heard on the tv or something , were you questioning that last point ?
is that why you chose not to shake the umpire 's hand ?
can i ask what might happen to the jacket now ?
was it leather ?
there was a lot of photographers around when you arrived on court . do you think that made you lose a bit of focus at the beginning ?
at the beginning we heard you say , oh , do n't worry , i 'm going to take it off . i 'm not going to play with it . do you think there were people that were actually worried you would play with that jacket on ?
did you realize she was going to be that good ?
does it feel different coming in as a seed this time ? i know that was a pretty big change .
is it a hard act to do all the outside stuff - the promos and the clothes and stuff - and keep your tennis where you want to it to be , knowing you have to take advantage of your moments both publicity-wise and tennis-wise ?
was it hard to wait , to start out so late in the tournament when everybody else has almost played a match or two ?
talking about style and what you bring to the court , you talked about how monolithic it is otherwise . what do you think the tour misses like when the williamses are n't around ?
if could take a step back and try and describe her outfit , how would you describe it ?
you 've had some interesting sleeves . have you ever seen sleeves like that in a tennis outfit ?
is wimbledon the most special of the four slams , do you think ? it 's the only one on grass , and everybody still wants to be here . what about it for you makes it ?
are you into tennis history ?
just wondering , you know , you 've worked your way back up this year and then you 're seeded coming in here , if this one stings a little bit more than other losses ? seems like you want to put it behind you pretty quickly .
did you think your last shot went in ?
did you ask the chair umpire about ...
do you think a particular style fits in on grass ? probably more on the women 's tour than on the men 's you find these sort of crazy upsets . is it just because of the short season , or is there a particular type of player that fits the mold more than others ?
earlier this week , mcenroe apparently suggested that it would be good to do away with warmup before the match starts . on the surface of it , it does seem a rather quirky thing to tennis that you help warm up the person that 's going to try to beat your brains out . can you just talk about that ? do you ever think , this is kind of weird ? or is it just so second nature that you ca n't imagine not having that ritual ?
if the tennis gods could chose between wimbledon and the us open playing the big match , either one or the other , which would you choose ?
have you started to plan your outfit for the us open yet ?
well done today ?
how did you feel that match went ? was it as perfect as it looked from the scoreboard ?
does did it feel like 2009 yet ? are you that comfortable just yet ?
what effect did that title and victory in birmingham have on you for your confidence ? what did you take from that ?
tell us how difficult that sort of ranks in terms of the matches you 've played here .
you had a breakpoint , did n't you , in the second game . did you think that was maybe a turning point ?
she hits it hard , does n't she , from the back of the court and moves around pretty quick as well .
do you think she could go on and have potential to get to the final ?
in terms of you said yesterday that you 're playing as if it could have been your last wimbledon . do you think you 'll be back here next year ?
does looking at people like kimiko when she comes back and takes venus almost nearly all the way , does that give you fresh inspiration ?
you said you would carry on even though your knees were knackered . you said that would n't prove a barrier . do you feel all right , that you can carry on physically ?
and the fire inside you , there 's still the desire to play ?
you mentioned ranking . obviously a positive thing for wimbledon this year is a first-round win means that you go up in the rankings . can you talk about the work that you do all year around to maintain that ranking which perhaps the british public do n't know about ?
and assuming that you have a good year fitness- and injury-wise , what would be a good year between now and coming here next year for you ?
it 's a little bit further ahead , but has it been explained how the british sports will work out for the olympics ?
is that big motivation ?
can you explain the setup ?
let me ask you finally about laura and heather . laura made it through ; heather lost . is that good indication for the state of the game ?
you looked fairly comfortable . did you feel in control from the start ?
what do you know about your potential opponents in the next round ?
i think it 's finished . it 's johansson .
can i just ask what you thought of bethanie 's outfit today , the jacket with the tennis balls on it ?
would you ever consider wearing something like that on the tennis court ?
was that the best win of your career ?
first time you 've played at wimbledon ; were you nervous ?
you were leading in the second set and in the third set and was broken back . did you think then that you had lost , that she would n't be able to go on and win at that point ?
this year , is this the first time you 've played on grass ?
li na being the first asian grand slam winner , has that been an inspiration to you ?
have you spoken to li na at all for advice ?
kimiko , has she spoken to her ?
do you know anything about zheng jie ?
what were your emotions at the end of that match ?
what made your decision to come here ?
do you feel like you appreciate it more now , the tennis ? maybe you took it a little bit for granted before ?
did you feel anything different today heading out there , or was it more that it really hit you at the end of the match ?
would you say you played better or much better than you expected ? she was a tough cookie today .
you 've talked about the road you 've been on . maybe monica has had a near-death experience like you describe . must be pretty daunting . what have you learned from that experience ?
how does it compare to some of the other experiences you 've had in kenya or at the port in ghana ?
of all the times you 've gotten emotional after a match in your whole career , how would you compare today ?
what did you prove to yourself today ?
you had a strap on your back .
do you hold the restaurant where the incident took place culpable ?
you come from a litigious culture . you 've lost $ 6.5 million potentially that you could have earned as the result of the negligence . i mean , what was the restaurant called ?
you said before the match that your mother was worried about your health . can you relieve her now ?
you said before the game you felt better than ever . how do you feel right now physically ? how much do you think it 's taken out of you ?
are you a contender for this title ?
after what you faced off the court , is there anything on the court that can faze you ?
you looked very stylish today in your outfit . last year at wimbledon it was strawberries and cream inspired . what was the thinking behind today ?
and the black pom-poms ?
when you fly now on the airline , do you have to take any precautions before you fly after the illness you had ?
injection , too ?
were you nervous going out ? you lost those first two games kind of quickly . was that nerves as much as anything or rust ?
do you have a cold ?
you recently said during this struggle at your low moments you cried , were very depressed . in your book you were very open how when you were upset before , when you were coming back from your surgery , you went to outside counseling . how did you overcome your depression ?
this was a very unusual day that you described . how do you think you 'll look back at today ?
between you and venus , who is in better physical shape right now ?
have you always been spiritual ?
what american athlete would you compare , attention-wise , to the attention that andy murray draws these two weeks here ? would it be like a-rod ?
that could be seen as negative .
what is your take on lebron ?
do you think there 's something about this venue that caused this in you ? do you think this could have happened in australia or new york ? do you think it 's centre court , coming out , the defending champion ?
how did it feel to be back on the grass ?
it was all russian once again . in the past you 've talked about russian tennis . you 've said there 's not too many alternatives . also talk about some of the other elements , the toughness of the culture , the roles of kournikova , yeltsin , the olympics , if you would .
obviously your father is an incredible man . comes to america , puts you on a bicycle taking you to the tennis lessons . how does he express the russian culture with that determination ?
inside yourself , so many years in l.a. , do you feel more like a russian than an american internally ?
you 've talked about how you feel that everything is more meaningful to you now after coming back from your injury . how important is it to you at this point to win another grand slam ?
you said you spoke russian , ate russian food .
we are going to see wozniacki on the court 1 now . of course we do n't know your next opponent , but could you tell us a little about if you 're having caroline in the next round what kind of opponent would that be for you ?
match point , yes .
this is the first match you 've won since your fiancee passed away . you 've played three . did it seem easier on the court ? how were you feeling ?
do you think it 's better for you that you have the distraction of playing tennis right now ?
if you 're going to meet caroline wozniacki , you know what kind of game you will to have come up with to beat her ?
must have been nice to get back to winning ways at wimbledon .
serve was quite big at the start . how was it coping with how fast she was serving ?
second round for the third time . you 're up against a top-10 seed again . do you feel you 're unlucky with the draw ?
as the match developed , you seemed to be really enjoying it again after quite a tough few months .
you know as well as anyone what it 's like for british players to come here , the expectations . is there anything that you 've learned over the years how to prepare for this ? is there anything you did differently this year ?
have you done anything differently this year ?
was it like stepping back into a nightmare again going back onto that court ?
did you sense , because of everybody going out in the first round last year , did you feel that put a lot more pressure on you given that you were expected to win ?
what did you think when you saw the order of play and saw the court you were on ?
it did n't concern you , did n't make you think , oh , no , not again ?
katie was talking yesterday about the financial pressures when you 're outside the top 100. it 's made her consider a future in the past and it 's making her do so now . a win like that must really reinvigorate you after having similar feelings yourself after australia ?
you 're working with jeremy now , who had to shoulder the british thing pre-tim and greg . has he been a help getting your mind right for wimbledon ?
do you think because of what you 've been through over the last couple of years with injuries and form , things like that , do you think if you might have lost today , that could have possibly been your last time here ?
you 'll go into petra full of confidence in a couple days ' time ?
it 's always good to see your brother james around at the same tournaments . do you ever have chats regarding each other 's matches ?
the british men in particular are coming from a lot of stick in the recent past . can you tell us briefly what you think the state of the game is as far as british women are concerned ?
we do n't actually have any girl players in the itf top 100 juniors . are you saying there are others out there perhaps that we do n't know about or are n't on the radar ?
is it an ambition of yours to play in the olympics here next year ?
tell us what your feelings are after that .
what did you think went wrong ? you started well serving .
i guess it 's quite hard to prepare yourself for your first time at wimbledon . was the experience kind of what you thought it would be ?
when you say you were emotional , because you had family there , or just because it 's a dream thing ?
did the emotion thing work against you ?
now you want to come back again ?
you 've been getting some good results and your ranking has come up gradually . are you happy with how your career is developing outside of the lta structure ?
anne said you and her get on well off the court . do you feel , because of your situation with the lta , are you a bit of an outsider ? with the other girls , is it almost like your status is the same ?
do you feel a lot of pressure coming through as a youngster in a country that 's struggled for so long for a tennis champion ? do you feel pressure as one of the juniors , younger players , coming through ?
i presume , given the lack of financial support that a lot of the other british players enjoy , this was quite a big deal for you financially ?
you do n't use the lta money . can you explain that ?
your sister came down from manchester today . was that a daughter with her ?
could n't get courtside ?
will she be your water dispenser next year ?
how satisfying a win was that ?
what did you do to defeat those demons ?
specifically in the second set when it might have gotten difficult , what did you tell yourself to refocus ?
seemed a bit like you channeled your aggression .
you were kind of fist pumping , kind of out-psyched her at key points in the match .
this is the fourth grand slam in a row you 've got past the first round . does that show the progression you 've made particularly the last two years ?
last year was a car crash obviously . is there a great sense of relief , i 'm in on my merit , through to the second round , we can push that car crash stuff to one side ?
you say drawing a qualifier is more preferable than a seed . that does put more pressure on you , does n't it ?
is that the mindset you developed since last year ?
john mcenroe was saying yesterday we should get rid of the prematch warmup on court . how important is that to you ?
just on court with your opponent .
and to get used to the court ?
did you see or hear about serena 's tears on court and can you understand the emotion of a first big win after an illness ?
can you recall feeling that emotion yourself in the past ?
venus , how did you feel out there playing ? this is your country , you 've won it a few times .
were there any nerves at all today ?
you mentioned expectations . what are they ?
when you and serena are not playing , which was the case for a lot of the last year , what is the void on the women 's tour , do you think ?
did you get bored or ...
what did you do ?
how long have you been studying this ?
where was the school ? where did you go to ?
you mentioned you missed being on the tour . how would you describe what you think the tour misses when you and your sister are not able to play ?
when you are playing , it 's a williams family affair . do you think your dad and your mom and sisters missed being out here as well ?
you rushed a bit getting back in australia . this time around , did you have to tell yourself , whatever happens , i 'm coming back at a hundred percent this time ?
how much faith do you have that your body could go a year without getting hurt again ?
what do you call the outfit you wore today ?
the back ?
is there anything you ca n't do on the court now that you could do five years ago ?
were you disappointed you did n't start on centre or court no.1 today ?
when you returned to play , when was that exactly that you came back for a full practice ? end of march , april ? when would that have been ?
you can hit the ball normally in a practice , do a full session .
i know your mom is worried about serena . how worried are you about serena playing here ?
do you bring a consciousness in your mind when you come to an event like this that , i do n't really need a lot of matches under my belt to play well and win ?
when you think about how long you 've been on the tour , you and your sister , are you disappointed at all that you have n't seen more minorities come up the ranks in the u.s. ?
you 've been out here a long time , 12 , 15 years . it 's not recently we 've seen what you might expect .
what do you think about kimiko ?
did you and serena decide you wanted to come back at the same time or is that a fluke how it worked out ?
given how long you 've been playing now , is it fair to call you an 'old school player ' ?
you mentioned the u.s. players , not as many coming up . why do you think that is ?
how did the break play out , the break for rain ? what effect do you think it had on the game ?
he told you to work more on moving her around ?
were you impressed by jelena ? do you think she can make it back into the top 30 ?
were you surprised how much a test she gave to you ?
how did you find it under the roof ?
they used it last year .
actually , it was the fourth time .
is there any effect underfoot with the roof on ?
are you happy with your form ?
you played against li na in the french open final . what do you think the impact of her victory has had in her country and around the world ?
sort of got away , did n't it , that first set ? by the time you started fighting in the second , time was running out , was n't it ?
was it the fact that she was just so good in the first set , or you had a slow start ?
katie , are you quite low on confidence at the moment ?
did you get to a point where anne got where she just said , whoa , i 'm struggling to the point where i might need to take a break from all this ?
so over the next few months , what do you think you 'll do ? anything you need to change ?
what do you do now ? go home and kick the cat ? analyze what you should do ? how do you get over this disappointment ?
was it a surprise to be put on that first-ever match on that new court ?
how did it feel as a court ? it did look pretty high . is there anything else different about it at all ?
you talk about the sort of mental toughness of being on the tour , but how is it financially as well for someone that perhaps bounces around between 100 and 200 in the world ?
are you sponsored ?
the problem is with wimbledon people look at what you may get for a first-round defeat forgetting how much your travel every year must cost , hotels , and everything else . it 's actually a fortune , is n't it ?
with that in mind , obviously wimbledon i presume is one of the big ones or `` the '' big one in your mind or in your . how agonizing is it to have your hopes up and then to be a couple hours into the tournament and as you say you 're having to deal with this disappointment ?
you 're a very nice person . do you think sometimes you do n't deserve these kind of knock backs ?
like you said , with the royal coming down and opening the court and all the people watching , do you think that affected you at all , all the ceremony of it ?
can we expect to see you back for a ninth wimbledon if you 're invited ?
you been doing a degree on the side ?
when you have something like this happen , do you sometimes think , is it worth it ?
you mentioned you have to be in absolute paramount physical shape . do you think you are at the moment ?
do you feel the pressure out there , katie ? the british public crave british success at wimbledon . can you sense that longing from the crowd when you 're on the court ?
so should that pressure be a burden or a motivation ?
court 3 , what sort of atmosphere was it ? what was your impression of it as a court ?
how disappointing was that , given the way you were playing before the rain delay and also afterwards ?
is it a loss of momentum or more a change of conditions ?
what effect did the break have on your ankle ? did you get some treatment ?
is it frustrating , particularly this sort of loss when you 've done so well this year and you 've got back to centre court ?
looking forward , does today convince you you can continue your way up the rankings the way you have been ?
is your movement one of the things you 'd be keen to work on ?
you said you did n't know how you 'd feel walking onto centre court . was it an emotional feeling walking back out there ?
do you have a goal rankings-wise that you think you can get back to ?
are you available for the next fed cup ?
could you expand a little bit on the things you need to learn from this match today .
have you studied the life of houdini ?
have you surprised yourself with the way you 've managed to fight through these matches this week ?
when she had five match points and she did n't put any of them away , did you start to think this could be your day ?
shortly afterwards you had your ankle strapped , and it was getting bigger by the minute .
in the beginning , you were almost down 4love . why the slow start ?
how is your ankle now ?
have you allowed yourself any thoughts about wimbledon yet ?
you 've got some family connections in eastbourne . how special was it to win in eastbourne for you ?
is this the best week of your tennis life ?
what other family did you have here apart from your father and your godparents ?
that 's it ?
what will this do for your career now , you think ?
a lot of people might look at your firstround match now as one of the most exciting now .
what 's your headtohead with caroline ?
you must feel that 's the match that got away from you ?
you had five match points . that must be very disappointing that you could n't ...
you said it 's a practice week . in terms of that , you must be delighted that you 've managed to get to the final ?
how difficult were the conditions ?
you said you wanted to get the tournament out of the way . now your focus is on wimbledon . what are your thoughts on the tournament ?
would you expect to have a big , long run in the competition ?
yes .
so how were the conditions out there ?
is it difficult not to get frustrated ?
down a set and 4love . what happened ?
how does it feel to be in a final of a big tournament like this ?
you had a great wimbledon . what is it about grass that an austrian likes ?
what does it do for the confidence , obviously ahead of such a big tournament like wimbledon next week , as well . puts you into such a big spotlight now .
looks like you will be playing angelique . what do you make of that ?
how long have you been working with andrei ?
not long , but what has he managed to help you with ?
how did you link up with him ?
what were your injuries ?
first of all , how is the leg ?
how was she able to come back so well against you ?
how disappointing is it for you to have got this far and not to be in the final tomorrow ?
on a positive note , though , this must give you a lot of confidence going into wimbledon next week .
how hard is it to keep your focus in conditions like that when you 're having to set yourself two or three times for one serve ?
yet another semifinal this year .
how much of a distraction was it to have to stop when you did for the long break ?
how difficult was the court ? how slippery was it ?
when you came back out to play , it was a little bit difficult for you ? you faced those break points . were you worried at that stage you would n't be able to continue the momentum ?
do you have a special thing that you do when there are rain breaks like this ?
get it off your mind , basically ?
and you were the only player playing today that 's won a title this year . does that give you a lot of confidence going into the semifinals ?
do you find this is good preparation for wimbledon ?
have you sampled english fish and chips here ?
you seem to be getting better and better this week .
your serve is usually a very good weapon , but it was even better today . you dropped i think two points on your serve in the second set ?
what sort of form do you feel you 're in compared to this time last year when you went on to win eastbourne ? where do you think you 're at ?
you did n't seem to have any trouble with your footing today , but was it at all slippery out there ?
that was my point , yeah . is the thought in the back of your mind that you have to be careful ?
is it ever a worry that by doing so well this week that you might go to wimbledon with little rest ?
on a day like this when you know that sort of rain is threatened , does that put more pressure ? do you feel more pressure to try to get things done quickly ? does it help or hurt your focus at all ?
when you come on grass , what 's the first thing that you focus on on kind of changing ? the tactics ? is it footwork ? getting low ?
when you go against top seeds , do you think , great , or do you think actually it would be nice to have that test going into wimbledon ?
have any of the other players kind of come up to you obviously the olympics drama and all that sort of stuff to kind of offer their commiserations or anything about the whole situation ?
great match for the first set , was n't it ?
in the tiebreak 41 , you should have won it from there , should n't you ?
good learning experience , though , for you ?
how was the thai meal last night ?
that 's not thai food .
it tasted good . that 's what counts ?
a lot of confidence going into wimbledon ?
at this stage of the season , what would you like to achieve in the next six months ?
what do you think is the main difference between someone like lucie and someone like yourself ? look at that first set . it was very , very close . what do you think the main difference is ?
is that something you try to extra work on , focus on big points and mentality on the big points ?
must be disappointing for you .
okay . what are your thoughts on the match ?
do you think you 're closing the gap on these people now ?
if you think back a couple of years , and you had expectations then , do you think you 've achieved those expectations or not reached them or exceeded them ?
this is a sport where you have to try and be patient and take your time with things . are you a patient person , or are you wanting to get so ahead quickly and as a result maybe all those results that you might have wanted or people expect of you are not necessarily coming as frequently or as fast as you 'd like ?
going into wimbledon next week , looks like you 'll be in top 100. it 's disappointing today to lose , obviously , but it must be quite nice for you to know you 've achieved that goal .
it 's a solid five matches that you had here . what 's the biggest positive takeaway that you have ?
that was a pretty comfortable match for you , was n't it ?
do you think it was better than the performance last year during the final ?
the wimbledon seeds came out today . for the men they apply a pretty strict equation to kind of reseed . for the women it 's a little bit more arbitrary . there is n't an actual formula . would you like to see for example , last year you did well here . that is n't necessarily taken into account for the seedings this year .
she 's not .
neither venus nor clijsters is seeded this year .
you hope it 's not you , or is that a big challenge for you ?
in recent years the grand slam winners have been getting a bit older in age . does that give you hope that you can go to an event like wimbledon next week and really contend ?
what are your thoughts on that ?
how much of a setback would wimbledon be without the match practices that you wanted ?
are you at all surprised that the top three yourself , agnieszka , and petra have lost today , or does that show that grass is such a difficult surface to adjust to ?
can you talk a little bit about some of the changes in your serve that you have employed ? looks like you 're moving your right foot back a little bit more . can you talk about that ?
do you think that it would enhance wimbledon and make it easier for players like you if there was a threeweek gap between the french open and wimbledon and you had more time to really properly prepare rather than this kind of dashed , lastminute dash that everybody has to do at the moment ?
obviously both yourself and your boyfriend have incredibly demanding schedules at the moment . i know he was here again today . is there any difficulty for either of you in kind of seeing as much of each other as you 're able to devote to your practice time in terms of balancing your sort of personal and professional commitments ?
good day for the brits , is n't it ?
how are you finding eastbourne ? have you explored the town ?
so what is he cooking for dinner ?
you said you were slightly nervous throughout that match . does that come from playing in front of the home crowd and a greater sense of expectation ?
how important is it to get more match practice on the grass this week ahead of wimbledon ?
you had a big doubles win as well yesterday with laura . talk about your partnership a little bit . is it just for the olympics , or do you guys kind of want to continue playing together , you know , after that ?
you must be well pleased with that ?
she 's a an old campaigner . to beat someone like that on the grass court is a good feather in the cap ?
what have you been doing on your serve ? it seemed to be particularly well today .
did momentum coming through qualifying really help ?
have you seen some of the other results today ? there 's quite a few upsets .
how do you feel ? do you get a special buzz as wimbledon gets nearer ? do you kind of get swept up in it , excited with it ?
is it difficult perhaps to really get totally into the tournament when you ca n't go home ? usually when you 're at a tournament you 're at a hotel and totally immersed in the tournament .
do you cook for your dogs ?
you 're going to be inside the top 100 .
well , according to your website , you are .
no ?
where would you , in your own rankings of matches and victories , where would you place today ?
much was made of your wimbledon campaign , the match with sharapova last year . how much of a different player do you feel you are 12 months on and the progress you 've made ?
you just love eastbourne , do n't you ?
what was the secret of your success today ?
what did you think when you got that draw ? it was incredible , really , wimbledon champion on grass .
what are your thoughts on that ?
how many days were you able to practice before the match today on grass ?
how damaging is it to only have one game , one match going into wimbledon ?
how do you feel physically ? i know you were struggling with a bunch of injuries through the clay season . how are you feeling now ?
what do you think of your serving today ?
last year you had a series of titles , a bunch of titles through this point in time . this year you have n't had that , but you made two slam semifinals . going into wimbledon , how much confidence does that give you kind of knowing that you do n't need to rack up the titles in order to go far ?
when you broke her serve when she was serving for the match , did you think you 'd kind of got out of trouble there ?
yes .
you said yesterday that winning wimbledon changed your life . can you give us a few examples of what happened to you in that respect ?
did you enjoy being famous , or was it at times a bit of a setback ?
this is a serious question : why are you winning and the other top players are not ?
you do n't seem to have any difficulty adapting and changing to grass .
with the top three seeds out , do you feel you have an even better chance of defending your title ?
a lot of the top players are going to be going into wimbledon with little match practice on the grass . how important do you think it is to have those competitive matches before wimbledon ?
must be nice to be back on the grass ?
how are you feeling about your game at the moment ?
it 's more than just a couple of months , is n't it ? you have been playing well for six or eight months now .
why the difference ?
can you talk a bit about how much you like grass and how you have to change your game for it ? it 's such a short season .
it always seems to me that you kind of have a real challenge when you play some of the really big power hitters , because you 're physically somewhat smaller and you play a lot with precision . there have been some great players , hingis and henin , who have managed to play well , but do you find it a particular challenge and how do you think about it ?
actually , a couple of years ago , petrova , i asked her who had the best hands of anybody , of the active players she played . she first mentioned henin , and then she said she was retired . then she mentioned you . i wondered , is that something you came by naturally or is it something that you think can be coached ?
are you enjoying eastbourne ?
have you seen any parts of the town apart from the tennis areas ?
polishitalian ?
because you 've won so much this year , you 're probably playing a lot more matches than you 're used to . is that difficult to adjust to , or is that actually beneficial to your game ?
it 's like not having enough garage space for your yacht .
is there on an old chinese saying , if you lose in sydney you must win in melbourne ?
where did it go wrong tonight , where in the last set ?
perth and here you had a lot of matches . are you in as good a state as you can be going to melbourne ?
and for this week , does it feel like it 's wide open , the australian open , that there are a lot of real contendere for it down there ?
in that last game there was someone who yelled out a couple times and it certainly bothered you . did you think about asking for a let at that point ? it was a weird exchange there .
it happened to you in melbourne , too . do you think that eventually they will stop yelling ?
what did your coach say after the first set ?
early in the third set , i think you were 1love down , seemed like all the momentum was against you . how did you turn that around ?
from a player 's point of view , it 's very hard when you can feel the crowd behind her , she 's the defending champion , there is a large chinese community in sydney .
how does a player deal with that when you feel like the crowd is on the other side ?
with 9 of the top 10 women here , it 's a virtual kind grand slam field . what does that mean for you to win here going to melbourne ?
is there something in your week here that you think , you know what , that 's an improvement from last year or something i 've done better than i 've done before ?
something in your tennis ?
when did you fit in the dances ? was that part of your rehab , recovery ?
no yoga , you prefer to dance ? some players do yoga .
is there a better way to start a season than winning a title ? must be the best thing you can do . must feel really good .
is that what this was at the end , a bit of celebration dancing for the crowd ?
who would you say is favored for melbourne , if you had to nominate someone ?
nice answer .
last year in istanbul you said the top 3 would dominate women 's tennis for a long time . do you think it 's going to be the case there this year in the australian open ?
looking at the level li played today , do you think she 's going to be a dangerous player to watch in the australian open ?
yes .
a lot of threeset matches here in general this week for the women . do you think that suggests that it 's pretty open down in melbourne in terms of who can win it ?
today was obviously not the result you wanted , but it 's been a good tournament . looking forwards to next week there will be more positive than negatives .
4:30 this morning is when you got to bed .
what happened in the four hours after the match ?
does it feel like the tournament in melbourne is very open , like there could be eight , nine , ten women who could win it ?
at the start of the week you said when you drew your sister you were obviously in the too happy about that . with the draw in melbourne tomorrow , are you a bit nervous about what might happen ?
if it does work out like that , what would be your reaction ?
rock , scissors , paper .
take us through what happened after the first set . you seemed to be in control and it slipped away .
you looked to be tiring out there towards the end . you 've had lots of tennis in the last week or so . probably getting a bit much . need a break .
do you still think it 's been good preparation the last couple weeks for the open ?
are there any things that were the same between today and last night ? both matches you won the first set very easy , and in the second set your opponent came back .
when you say it 's too high , it has to come down , do you mean the intensity ?
do you think the reason you lost today is because you did n't play your best or she was playing better ? talk about li 's play today .
if you would like to give some names that are top contenders in the open , will li be one of them ?
good way to start the new season . how do you feel ?
coming back from a set down make the win feel more special ?
li na played a great match , as you did today . you guys played three times last year and you split those . what do you think of her going into the final ?
do you have any memory of playing her at the australian open last year ?
would it have been nice to have a rematch with petra ? do you ever prepare for someone else ?
you won brisbane in 2009 ; you 've got a good relationship with australia . where do you think you made your improvements ?
what 's the one thing about li na that sets her apart from other players ?
do you think the way you played her last year in istanbul and the week you had will help your confidence coming to this match tomorrow ?
your wrist obviously had treatment . it was strapped and everything else . how serious or not serious is it ?
did it play a big part until the third set ? as the third set went on , was there a lot of pain ?
it just came on during the match , the wrist injury ?
you 've had five matches now since the start of perth . how to you feel going into next week ?
you 've been denied the chance to kind of stop kvitova in the final . you were on course to possibly meet her there and save your no.1 ranking . is that something you 're disappointed about or you 're not fazed ?
what did you take from tonight as a learning curve ? are you going to take positives ? what will you work on over the next few days ?
another day , another win . how does it feel today ?
how does it feel to be back in the semifinals ?
you 're on your way to defending your title . you won last year and went to the final of the australian open . do you feel you 're on track to do just as well or better ?
any thoughts on the possible semifinal matchup ? kvitova or hantuchova . few thoughts on both players ?
nice to play a lefty if you have to play petra , right ? there are not too many on the women 's tour .
when was the last time you feel your tennis was at this level ?
were you surprised when she challenged you so much in the second set ?
we have n't asked you about your husband . how is it going ?
still working well , obviously .
and the coach ?
so when you 're listening to him , are you doing what he 's telling you or sometimes you 're saying you are but you 're actually not ?
apart from the tennis , very bizarre day . windy , and then the lights go out .
was it a distraction at all for your tennis ?
you tested marion a fair bit today .
is that encouraging to you this early in the season that you could play at such a high level ? you guys were playing some really good tennis out there .
there is so much talk about caroline and petra going for no.1 , no.2 , that whole thing . you 're no.3 , not far away . you 're probably not getting the same kind of attention . does that help you not having that kind of spotlight on ?
did you think you would be so happy at love4 down in the third set ?
what 's the most satisfying coming back like that when you 've lost the last two firstround games you 've had here and she beat you twice last year . what 's the most satisfying about that win ?
when li na was in here , she said one of your great attributes is just how you fight for every point , every situation . i imagine that held you in good stead today in the third set .
what makes you not give up , because at love4 you could have maybe gone to melbourne and had a week . what makes you keep fighting ?
how big was that double fault in the game with the break point ?
you were at 41 , and then she double faulted to give you a break to get back to 42 .
did you sense that she was struggling because you were getting momentum back when her coach came on court ?
do you feel like the stars are aligning a little bit ? you and petra are 1 and 2. whoever wins here will take the no.1 ranking . do you feel like there is a lot riding on this tournament ?
i wanted to ask you one more about venus . she 's pulled out of the australian open . i know you played doubles with her a couple years ago . she says she 's coming back in february . of course you want her to come back healthy .
if you at your best is ten out of ten , where are you at the moment ?
three sets in the heat . probably not what you wanted this early in tournament , but you need it because this is australia .
she played serena last week in brisbane . did you see any of that match ? did you know much about her before ?
tell us about the fitness training . you mentioned last week you were in munich .
tell us what you did in the offseason .
did that standard you in good stead today into the third set ?
sam stosur has been eliminated yesterday , so you have n't got an opportunity to compete her before australian open . it 's pitiful for you ?
sam stosur was defeated yesterday , so you have n't got any opportunity to compete her just before australian open . do you think it 's a pity ?
especially since last year , you 've been on stadium court constantly . is it nice to kind of be on a smaller court and feel the crowd again and have that interaction ?
you 're defending champion this year . obviously a little bit different for you . how is it different ? do you feel extra pressure ? people now you now , i suppose . what you did in the australian open as well .
how much of a burden on caroline do you think it is that she has n't won a major ? it comes up every time she gives an interview .
the media makes a big deal of not winning a grand slam . do the players care if another player has a grand slam or not ? does she have as much respect because she 's no.1 if she would if she had won a grand slam ?
yesterday sam stosur said she had trouble dealing with the expectations . how do you deal with expectations and pressure ? what advice would you have for her ?
a few tough threesetters from some of the top seeds today . was it hard work out there ?
you played her twice before . you played her last year twice and lost to her at the us open . does that help a little bit coming from indoors to outdoors ? did it help that you knew your opponent ?
why did you want to play sydney ? you played hopman cup and could have gone to melbourne . why did you come do sydney ?
what did you find tough about the conditions ? you indicated that maybe adjusting from perth to sydney was difficult .
what sort of things do you do for recovery ?
do you normally find the heat difficult , or is it just because you 're coming back and it 's a new season ?
you won fed cup , hopman cup . how much of a lift do you get from that ?
did you feel like you did anything particularly well on the court today that you 're happy with and you can take into your next match ?
good glimpses in the second set . you almost wish it would 've gone three sets ?
was that carryover from yesterday ? i saw your left thigh was strapped , but you 've had that for a while .
what do you put that down to ? you 're such an experienced campaigner , to freeze is a bit usual .
what can you do for the next match in case that happens again ? are you worried about it many coming back ?
it 's probably pretty obvious , but having an injuryfree year would be nice for you after the last few years with the stop start .
does it encourage you the longevity in the game today ? it seems it has changed from when you were first on the tour and then ten , twenty years before that when most of the players that were dominating were very young . now you see players going through their late 20s , 30s , like the williams sisters .
apart from a being able to string a few matches and get a few tournaments , what would you like to see yourself do this year ?
what did you discuss with the trainer out there today ?
with the trainer , with the coach .
was what your game plan going into the match ?
when was the last time you felt those kind of nerves ?
not in australia before ?
are you confident you can get on top of the nerves before next week ?
very convincing scoreline obviously . did it feel more tight than that , or did you feel in control all the way through ?
must be hard to play against her never knowing if she 's going to club a winner or miss by a mile .
is that because of expectations here ? is that why you say it 's not easy to play here ? there are a lot people watching .
do you think that was something you could maybe capitalize on drawing her first up ?
did you think that would be in your advantage that she would be under a lot pressure playing here in australia ?
is that the mindset you have to adopt against sam because you know she 's going to be so aggressive ?
great start to your tournament here . what pleased you most about that performance ?
you were out after beijing because of your knee . is that all okay now ?
what happened to the petko dance ? i did n't see it .
( question regarding basketball . )
what 's his name ?
your dad told me . i saw it , but i ca n't remember it .
how long have you done that ?
the petko dance , were there any superstitions about that ?
your father also said there were a few people finding the dance a bit too full on ; is that right ?
will the dance come back ?
were you a little bit surprised by the way the match went ? she a really great player . seemed like you handled things well and were pretty seamless .
i know you 've been asked this question before , but how do you explain the success of german women 's tennis right now ?
do you think that there is any other group of girls like yours on tour ?
in perth you got better as the week went on . was today another step on the road for next week ?
preparation for next week . was today another good step towards it ?
which parts of your game are you happy with at the moment and which ones do you still feel need work ?
what 's the secret to your success and strengths and areas you need to improve ?
was there moment in the second set that you got a little bit worried ? she fought back and you had to work a little harder . is that nice to have a little bit of a challenge in the second set ?
how well do you think you 're playing compared to this time last year ?
an event like this when there are so many of the top 10 here , do you keep an eye on the other people in the top 10 to see how they 're doing as well , or are you just focused on what you 're doing ?
how is the knee ?
what 's the goal for london games ? do you go for gold ?
what pleased you most about that performance ?

you had a slow start today . it was just kind of a tough day for you on the court .
where does australia rank for you ?
you said everyone is pleased to see each other . do you miss being on tour ?
your emotions at the end of the match seemed to show that this just meant a fair bit to you , this opportunity .
that last win here seems a long time ago . how different are you from now till then ?
how daunting will be it be for azarenka going into her first grand slam final . how do you think she will be feeling ?
what do you think is different today compared to that wimbledon final ? what do you think you did better ?
that challenge you made at 4all in the third it was love30 , would have been love40 how sure were you of that call , and how much of a turning point do you think that was ? seemed the momentum totally changed in the end after that .
did that change momentum ?
you had some trouble with your serve . you had the 10 double faults and everything . what was going on there ?
you won a title so early in your career . do you get the sense you can appreciate the opportunity a little bit more now ?
has it been frustrating at times to not get back to that grand slam title after having that success earlier ?
did you ever consider you would n't get back to your best ?
do you feel better than ever now ?
how long did it actually take you to find a serve that you were comfortable with once you came back to the game ?
victoria has beaten you in two finals before ?
so is there a really aggressive mindset that you need , too ?
is it tough to play an opponent that has such a similar game to you ?
well , victoria i think might have a more similar game to you than petra does .
this is going to be a headtohead battle for no.1 ranking . does that add anything to it , do you think ?
you seemed to get some momentum in that second set . how did the third set play out to maria 's advantage , do you think ?
was that the difference ? she took advantage of her break point opportunities ?
there was a challenge at 4all in the third set that would have given you love40 . do you think that was a big turning point in the end of the match ?
can you talk about how you feel overall ? are you disappointed not to get through today ?
are you going to the laureusin london . how do you see your chances there ?
how do you see your chances there ?
were there any big changes in her performance in this match compared to the wimbledon final ?
do you still have some meanings on that no.1 ? i mean , in the future , you can get it , as well .
are you going to hang around here to watch adam ?
what 's the overriding emotion after all that for you ?
what about walking off , leaving it behind ?
were you losing focus ? what was going on in the third ?
given what happened to your ankle , are you more encouraged how far you got despite that ?
the ankle today , how much of an issue was it for you ?
if it had n't been this tournament , this occasion , would you have stayed in the tournament ?
has it always been important to you to keep competing like you are at the top level ?
( indiscernible . )
what will you do now ? give your ankle a rest for a couple of weeks ?
you mentioned azarenka 's movement being much improved . what else in her game have you seen has really come along in the past year ?
what was going through your mind at the late stages of the match ? is it better not to have anything there or are all kinds of thoughts crowding in ?
this time next year do you imagine you 'll be sitting watching on television or will tennis be very much in the past for you ?
how much of a goal is it for you to do well at the french open this year ? is that your next big target ?
how proud are you that you ended the third set so well ?
what were your thoughts when you won that last point ?
it 's been a long time you 've waited for this moment . how are you going to turn this around and make sure you get back on the job , not let those emotions overtake you ?
how badly have you wanted this opportunity ?
that 's got to be the biggest win of your career , beating a fourtime grand slam champion in the semifinals , no ?
was that the toughest match in your career to end it up ? you mentioned on the court you were nervous . was that maybe the toughest one ?
what did you think after the second set when kim was so dominant ?
how much do you think the fitness work you did in the postseason contributed to coming out tougher in the end ?
almost every player will say , i believe in myself , i believe in my game . but sometimes , especially when they 're younger , maybe they do n't really understand the circumstances . is there a difference now when you say , yes , i believe that i can go beat someone like kim , than maybe like a couple years ago ?
can you talk about facing sharapova or kvitova in the final ?
do you feel better playing against each one ?
do you remember your first itf events in israel in 2003 ?
yes .
you must have been really small then , huh ?
what were you doing over there at such a young age ? most of the kids are playing juniors then .
in a sense , you 're still very young . but you 've been on the tour almost 10 years now . can we call you a veteran ?
is there any extra satisfaction knowing that you 've knocked out the defending champion here ?
the legs thing that your manager is tweeting at you , what is that all about ?
pretty commanding performance .
a bit of impatience and excitement to put it away at the end ?
how do you feel going up against kvitova in the next match ?
out of that wimbledon final , what do you take from that ?
i guess before playing your match you did n't have the time to watch the other match . did you see little pieces of that and what was your impression of both errani and kvitova in that match ?
how is your fitness ? do you feel confident in your body , being able to get around the court ?
roger federer said yesterday he was quite surprised to see how intense the women are during their matches , a lot of fist pumping . you 've always done a bit of that . do you sense that the women are expressing themselves a bit more or is that an indication of how competitive it is at the moment ?
what is your reaction to the fact that errani is only 10 days younger than you and they say is a newcomer , and you 're not a newcomer ? they almost call you a veteran . two different ways to be 24 years old . how do you see it ?
i remember a few years ago you said you did n't see yourself able to play until 30 years old or so . have you changed your mind ?
jimmy connors stopped at 40 years old .
physically how do you feel compared to wimbledon coming into this match against petra ?
a bunch of players this week have made comments talking about how they think the noise that you and azarenka in particular make is excessive .
radwanska was one player that said she thinks the noise you and azarenka make is excessive and she 'd like to see the wta change the rules to prohibit that .
yes .
after she lost her quarterfinal .
if there was a rule change , how do you think it would affect you if you had to stop ?
with the no.1 spot up for grabs this week , how much of a motivation is that for you ?
tougher day today compared to your match against serena . could you talk us through it .
did you go into the match with a game plan ? you 'd played once before .
was it hard emotionally after such a big win in the fourth round over somebody who has won so many grand slams ? was it hard to come back mentally ?
whereabouts was your game compared with where it was against serena ?
being a fellow russian player , do you know maria very well off the court ?
have you ever practiced together , hit together ?
from what you saw today , do you think she can win here ?
after you beat serena the other day , did you go out and have a nice dinner , mark the occasion , or treat it like any match ?
any goals for the rest of the year ? are you looking at top 20 now ?
you .
a win is a win , and you 're back in the semifinals . but it looks like it was a bit of a struggle out there . what were your sensations today ?
today how were you feeling on the court ?
talk about your comeback in the second set . you were down 41 .
you have a pretty good chance to be no.1 . can you talk about that .
would that be something special for you ?
did you change your racquet when you were 24 down ?
different from playing with makarova in the next round , the semifinal or sharapova ?
what has being the wimbledon champion given to you ? what are the positives ? has there been anything negative from it ?
do you feel more confidence because you are a wimbledon champion ?
how do you compare your level now and your wimbledon level ? in wimbledon you beat sharapova .
can you talk about your experiences with maria and ekaterina previously .
why do you think you were able to come back today ? what did you do well ?
on a lighter note , there 's been a lot of talk about the birds that have been in rod laver arena at this tournament . have you noticed them ? have they been a distraction at all to players ?
you had tape on your left leg today . is it something old or you got it in the last match ?
what is the significance of the towel that you put on your head at the change of ends ?
would you prefer officials to do something about the birds ?
try to get an eagle in to scare them away .
tough loss in the singles . how did you manage to pick yourself up for the doubles ?
did your partner say anything to you to try to lift you ?
were you pleased with your performance against petra ?
do you think you can carry on this form for the rest of the season ?
what do you think about the way the match unfolded ?
were you feeling that maybe at the end of the second set you were taking a bit maybe physically the lead over her ?
what do you take out of the tournament ? how do you sort of view the tournament ?
what does it mean for you to lose the no.1 spot ?
you have made it this far in slams a number of times and you 've gone beyond . are you still convinced that you 'll have that breakthrough and get that first victory at a grand slam ?
will you try to change your strategy in any way going forward against some of these players who you lost to now ?
you played kim three times now . you were close each time . what do you miss for this last little step ?
did you have the impression she was a little bit less strong at the end of the second set ? that you could make it , if you won the second set you could make it to a third one ?
what 's your program in the next sort of four to six weeks ?
do you have to reproach yourself anything in this tiebreak ? because you had all first serves in the tiebreak . you had a very good tiebreak , and yet ...
learning from what kim has done , is it something you can learn from now despite the fact you 're no.1 in the world and she 's done what she 's done that you still feel like you can learn a lot from her ?
you started well . can you talk a little bit about that first set .
after that tiebreak , you must have been going into that change of ends before the second set feeling confident .
was the heat much of a factor ?
what do you think azarenka 's chances are of going all the way ?
there 's been a lot made of the noise of some of the female players . what are your thoughts on that ?
the wta is looking at it . they 're possibly going to review their rules . do you think they should ?
what do you think they should do about it ?
are you amazed they do it every point ?
that they do it every single shot .
after a tough match like that in terms of the heat and the temperature , what do you do physically to help you recover ? have you been in the ice bath ?
you looked in control on the start of the match and suddenly it got tougher at the end of the second set . how were you feeling in the tiebreak ?
do you feel you were 100 % after what happened last match ?
can you give us an idea about , say , the last 48 hours how much you had to do to get ready and whether it was a lot more complicated than other times you had to get yourself ready for a match ?
is there any ancient belgian recipe or snake oil that you used , something that you swallowed or rubbed into it or something ? ( laughing . )
when you hit that big forehand that took you to match point , you looked really relieved , almost emotional . what was going through your mind then when you got to those two match points ? you hit that enormous forehand .
can you explain lack of match practice , i guess , a little injured , where does that unbelievable belief come , the selfbelief come from ?
does that give you a sense of destiny what happened against li a little bit when you saved four match points and win a match like that ?
does stress ever really go away in big matches ? completely where you 're out there and you have zero stress at all ?
your ankle in the third set against li and compared to the second set today , does it feel the same ? does it feel worse better now two days later ?
sometimes it 's forgotten that after you first became no.1 it took you more than two years for you to actually win your first slam . now caroline has been going through it for a long time . she was actually no.1 a lot more weeks than you were . can you kind of relate how tough it is for her to come out every single slam and not win it and people are saying , oh , you 're not a legitimate no.1 ?
she 's never beaten players like yourself or serena . did you feel today , maybe especially in the end of the second set , that she 's getting closer ?
each of the matches you 've played so far when you 're standing in the tunnel waiting to come out , is there ever a thought this could be the last time i 'm coming out onto the court of the australian open ?
did you get a scan on the ankle ? what is it exactly ?
few thoughts on azarenka , semifinal match coming up ?
congratulations .
what is your reaction to this win , first ? and to what martina say yesterday , she say that in her opinion wozniacki is not the true no.1 , but is either you or kvitova .
martina navratilova .
what 's yours ?
two years ago in the quarterfinals you 're up a set and 40 against serena and playing great . today you get down a set and manage to pick your level up again . talk about maybe the different player and person you were two years ago to now .
that kind of thing can take a long time to learn , huh ? it 's a lot easier said than done to put things in the past if you 're not playing that well .
there is a lot being made in discussion points about the noise from yourself and maria . what 's your take on it ? i know it 's been brought up previously and again now . what 's your understanding or your point of view on it ?
so you started as a child ?
the wta is looking at it and obviously assessing their options . do you think they need to be acting on it ?
is there anything else they should be looking at ?
martina spoke about you quite a lot yesterday , and said she thought you had an ahha moment when you were speaking to your grandmother about all the jobs that she used to do . is that true ? what can you tell us about that ?
that helped you to get a sense of proportion about the things that were worrying you in your tennis ?
what did your grandmother do as an occupation ?
what motivates you more , becoming no.12001 or winning a grand slam ?
do you know how to relax , or during the offseason when you 're supposed to relax do you find yourself getting up and doing chores all the time ?
what would you point out as the biggest difference between belarusian and russian ?
yes .
can you elaborate a little bit ?
where do you feel at home now ? you spend a lot time in the states and you 've now got the place in montecarlo , still obviously very belarusian . where do you feel at home ?
talk about playing caroline or kim . obviously played them both a lot . big challenges both ways .
i remember you talking about the wimbledon semifinal , and petra obviously had a great tournament . but i think you mentioned you thought in the third set there were maybe a couple chances where you could have done a couple things differently . will that teach you anything about the next match if you get into a third set maybe ?
is it right that you live in the same block as novak in montecarlo and then maybe somebody else ?
do you ever see them ? ever hit with them ?
what are your thoughts on that ?
you looked sluggish out there , like you were having difficulty moving . was it the heat ? anything wrong ?
were you having particular problems moving to your left during the match ?
servingwise you had a couple decent games . for you that many doubles is real inconsistent .
is that because you were n't getting a push off the ankle ?
was it just a bad day at the office or were you not really a hundred percent ?
what was your first sort of response when you think back through it ? anything that stands out ? what is your initial response to the loss ?
is there any one thing that you put it down to today ?
you said she played well against you . what gave you the most problems with her ?
you 've had some incredible comebacks here . azarenka a couple years ago , you were down a set and 40. was there any point in the second set where you felt your game was going to come back , or were you just thinking it was n't going to happen for you today ?
did you have any sense this was coming in practice ? were you feeling okay before the match ?
we 've seen you play your way into tournaments pretty often . does this lack of matches make you more susceptible to having an off day like this ?
if this was n't a slam , would you have played ?
when do you think you 'll play next ?
you can play on clay in acapulco .
how important are the olympics to you this year ?
do you get there 's a sense of a buzz amongst the players , that they all want to get there ?
have you and andy definitely decided you 're playing mixed together there or not ?
decent chance venus plays fed cup with you ?
are you surprised by how you feel right now ? we 've seen you come in after defeats and not project like you are now . are you surprised by how you 're feeling ?
seems like there 's perspective here . seems like you 're motivated to go back out there . i think if you compare this to other press conferences after defeats , you 'd agree that they 're a little different .
what percentage would you say the ankle is ?
you 're obviously happy to advance in the tournament , but how happy were you with your game tonight ?
what part of her game gave you the most trouble tonight ?
how much do you think your experience counted out there tonight ?
must be hard to get a read on her game because she 's slapping at the ball pretty hard the whole time .
did you think just in the second set to play more rally balls , but in a sense you have to dictate , too , because if you do n't she 's going to clock a winner from anywhere ?
i do n't want to beat a dead horse , but movementwise you 're looking pretty good out there . you got balls back with something on them .
just talk about that , because that 's not a part of your game that 's discussed very often .
did you watch serena 's match today ?
were you happy to see her get out of your path here ?
how do you approach a match against someone like her ?
you beat her what , madrid , rome last year ? madrid was fairly close , but rome you got her pretty good . did you see her make a big jump from there to today 's tournament ?
is it becoming more difficult to make you smile at the press conferences now , to find a way to have a cheerful answer ?
what do you consider your age is when you look at yourself ?
your age .
do you feel yourself you are young or so many years on tennis that maybe you 're older than your age ? in relationship with what you have done in the tennis ...
why would it be the highest note of your career when you were 17 ?
you were asked a question about being cheerful . when you hit a great winner , you do the fist pump , do you feel happy or is it just satisfaction ?
russian tennis is destroying american tennis . are you surprised and how much ?
can you talk about hard courts . i think they 're your favorite surface .
watching you play , it sounds strange that you 're only no.56 in the world . can you explain if it 's a mistake .
looking at other russian girls , there were some more than the others that inspired you or you would like to imitate , or there 's none ?
you mentioned the last six tournaments last year you went out in the first round . how can you explain that to what 's happened this week ? such a change .
how did you feel going into the match ? were you nervous to play serena or were you feeling quite comfortable out on the court from the first point ?
was there some change mentally ? people say tennis happens in the head very much .
does your last name mean anything ? sounds a little bit like macaroni in italian .
you do n't like the macaroni or ...
can you talk a little bit about closing out that first set . you had a few set points . were you a little nervous at that point ?
what about those three match points , when you lost those ?
you look a little bit like gwyneth paltrow . do you know her ?
can you talk about your next round , either lisicki or sharapova .
what did you feel was n't working so well out there tonight ? was it just consistency ?
how important do you think that third game in the third set was ?
do you have a goal to reach the top 10 ? you 're very close now .
do you have a date set ?
how were you feeling today ?
were you distracted by the smash you missed at 53 ? is it why you lost a bit of momentum at the end of the second set ?
martina navratilova was in here earlier and spoke in glowing terms about you , thought it could be a real breakthrough for you . what does that mean to you ?
have you spoken to her at all , crossed paths ?
the missed shot , was that the worst miss you 've made in your career ?
the other day you walked onto the grounds past a big line of fans . you just had your bag on . you seemed very relaxed . are you able to keep that aura about your camp when you 're on your way to being no.1 and perhaps winning here ?
what is a balance for you ? is it always talking about the tennis and going back to the practice court , or do you kind of leave that once you leave the grounds ? are you able to kind of do some relaxing things , too ?
i know you said you 're not thinking about it so much , but what would it mean to you to become no.1 ? is this a major goal of yours in your career ?
what book are you reading right now ?
i 'm wondering if you watched li na 's game yesterday . do you know what happened in the tiebreak ? according to your experience , how can she improve so that does n't happen again ?
how hard is it for a player to refocus on the game , to play normal after losing such a great chance ?
thoughts on that ?
how did you try and get back into that match ? mentally how did you find that rhythm ?
do you think she was thrown off by missing the overhead towards the end of the second set ?
her power off the ground , does it compare to the biggest hitters in the game : serena , kim ?
she 's probably going to take over the no.1 at some point in the near future . what advice would you give her having climbed that mountain yourself ?
i know you 've worked on your serve recently and seems like you did serve really well in this tournament . are you happy with that part of your game ?
you had a pretty solid result here this week . how are you feeling generally about your game and where it was compared to three , four years ago ?
( question off mic . )
you ever talk to caroline about dating a golfer ?
no , dating a golfer .
can you talk about your game plan today . it worked so well .
did you change anything with your doubles partner before this match ? did she give you any advice ?
can you talk about how does it feel to be into the quarters for the first time in a grand slam .
you have to be fairly happy with that effort , i would think .
what were you thinking at 5all ? you were up 41. you seemed to be in control . then she made a pretty big push back . she was coming to the net a lot , hitting the line . so when she gets to 55 , what are you thinking ?
maybe that 's why you hit the forehand into the net . ( laughing . )
strategywise , it looked like you changed it up a little bit against her . you were playing her forehand a lot .
did you get any particular advice on playing her from richie , because obviously he knows her game very well ?
next match could be a big step up . kim 's , she got out of jail kind of today . she 's defending champion . she 's won grand slams and you 've had a hard time against her . maybe you might even have to play better than you did today , huh ?
at what point did you think she was out ?
do you think you will step in the same trap as li na did , the mental trap ?
how are you planning on trying to take advantage of her injury ? she still could be moving not as well as usual .
what about your wrist problems ?
how much are you looking forward to the challenge of playing her , you know , on the big court , grand slam champion , your being no.1 , a lot of people will be anticipating it .
would you like a daylight match instead of the bugtime ?
are they more dangerous than kangaroos ?
how did you find the experience out there today ?
was it unnerving or unsettling for you , the publicity surrounding your brother ?
how do you think you handled the whole situation in your game ?
did you get some support from bernard today ?
did he give you any tips before the match ?
do you have big hopes and dreams like bernard ?
what do you think at this stage is your biggest strength in your game ?
and have you got a particular goal that you want to achieve for this year ?
will you be watching the match tonight ?
what are you expecting ?
you and bernard 's girlfriend sit side by side in the box . what do you girls talk about while he is playing ?
so you feel like whenever you watch him you 're learning ?
is bernard an inspiration to you ?
do you get to hit much with him ?
how tall are you ?
are you expecting to grow some more ?
obviously your father has had a big say in your career , and i would assume a dominant figure in the initial teaching .
you are also coached by johnny on the gold coast ?
so they both sort of advise you ?
do you want to be no.1 in the world , as well ?
just wanted to clarify that .
it was quite hot out there .
relative to bernard , you seem quite talkative .
and you enjoy media , is it ?
do you get nervous coming in here talking to all of us ?
that looked pretty easy for you today .
were you surprised at her performance as well ?
this is a tournament where you 've done well . it 's the first place you reached a grand slam quarterfinal . is this a particularly favorite place for you to play ?
what did you learn from the match in sydney ?
can you compare where you were last year when you came here off the injury , right , did n't know if you were going to play , pulled out that crazy win against date , to where you are now gamewise and personally ?
if you look from wimbledon to now , you probably had maybe one result that you did n't like so much against kerber , right ? played pretty well every single tournament . why do you think that is ?
how about personally for you ? how much has your coaching change helped your turnaround ?
you 've never made the semi of slam before . how much would making your first one soon mean to you ?
aga , do you feel like your game and victoria 's have changed over the last ten years a lot , or is it almost like playing the juniors again ?
do you remember your first match against victoria as a junior ?
any of them ?
no ?
but there is no secrets between you two , so when you go on court it 's not like you can fool her , right ?
aside from the tennis , how difficult is it for you to play a friend ? obviously you 're a professional . do you have to approach the match differently , think about it differently ?
what will you do for the next day and a half in preparation ?
anything to relax ?
can i ask you about caroline . if she loses tonight i think she loses no.1 . i know she 's one of your best friends . do you think it might be better for her for a couple months not to have to deal with the whole , are you a legitimate no.1 ? should you have won a grand slam ? it might be easier on her emotionally ?
bad luck . how did kim 's injury affect you ? how did it affect your game ?
can you say anything about how you played at the end ? because you nearly came back in the third set . you got very close .
can you talk about the tiebreak ? on the fourth match point she lobbed you , but you did n't really try and run for it , even though i think you may have been able to get to it .
do you believe in the year of dragon ? do you think the year of dragon will be more auspicious for you ?
last year you had the same with wickmayer in dubai .
is there an explanation for it ?
is it a matter of nerves ?
were you affected by the heat today ?
in the tiebreak , at one point you seemed to take your finger to your mouth towards the crowd . was someone in the crowd bothering during the tiebreak ?
i thought i saw you on television do that .
what happened at the beginning of the third set ? was the loss of the tiebreaker and the match points still in your head ?
have you ever had a match where you had four match points that you did n't take ?
against kim last year in sydney , you turned 05 , at 5love down in the first set , you turned it around . is it easier to play against an opponent when you 're down , when you have nothing to lose anymore ?
this the first grand slam of the year . the whole year is in front of you . would you like to change your game against a particular opponent like kim , or do you think you 'll continue with the same strategy and same type of game ?
what do you think you 'll take away from the match today going forward ?
are you going to head back to china ?
did you think kim was at her best level after a couple of games coming back after her injury ?
was there anything about caroline 's game tonight that surprised you ?
i have seen you had tissues at a lot of your matches here . is this something that just started recently or it 's been going on ?
now you have some time to focus on winning a second mixed doubles grand slam title .
i do n't know . i have n't looked .
have you already made up your mind about next week , fed cup in belgium ? are you gon na play ?
how about your win of the mixed doubles ?
what happened out there ? seemed like you were a little bit out of sorts .
did you feel well or have any problems ? i know you had a virus last week .
just could n't find your momentum ?
keep the leg elevated for now ?
how close were you to pulling out with the ankle ?
you mentioned on court that it played on your mind that this is your last australian open . how important was that in your decision to stay out there ?
what was going through your mind in the tiebreak when li had all those match points ?
and when you were 52 , what was going through your mind then ?
were you exhausted after the last point really , or could you play another game ? how did you play ?
you mentioned this is your last australian open . would you like to devote this particular australian open to anybody ? to your kids or your husband or your whole family ?
in tough moments of the game , do you draw inspiration from your family , close your eyes , or something like that ?
what do you think about li na 's performance today ?
do you have any advice to give to li na ?
did you sense li na 's frustration after the match ? have you got a chance to talk to her in the locker room ?
sometimes an ankle can get worse in the hours and days afterwards , so do you have any doubt that you 're going to be able to compete in the next rounds ? what 's the treatment from here on out ? what 's the prognosis ?
after the initial pain , it seemed that it went away . you were doing some splits and things like that towards the end of the match . did you lose consciousness of it as the match went on , or were you aware of it ?
nine years ago you were in a similar situation against serena . i 'm sorry to bring the memory back , but ...
no . actually what you did to get the frustration out of you and came back strong .
sorry . nine years ago you were in a similar situation against serena . you had a few match points but your loss . so after the match , what did you do to get the frustration out of you ?
you had match points .
this was the third time you played in the first match of the day in the morning .
are you getting used to these early starts or is it difficult to get going ?
do you feel like you 're flying under the radar here a little bit at the tournament ? there 's focus on other players . do you feel like you play better when there 's not so much attention on you or does it matter at all ?
have you ever felt better at a grand slam playingwise ? seems like you ca n't miss a ball .
meaning it 's helping defensive points when you 're not dictating at the beginning ?
did you do anything different in the offseason conditioning , fitnesswise ?

sixth time in the quarterfinals of a grand slam . you 've been to the semis once . what are your expectations now for the next couple matches ? are you feeling good enough to go to the semis or beyond ?
you have a pretty long history with radwanska , played her in sydney . you know her really well . you 're friends . she 's a whole different type of player stylewise . talk about that .
could you talk a little bit about your coach , sam , and the relationship you have with him .
is he tough ?
how is it for you when he 's really brutal one day and the next day you need support emotionally ? how does that kind of work ?
but you 'll argue with him . i assume you 're not the type of person if someone says something to you to do everything this way , you think another way , i 'm sure you express your opinion a little bit ?
you have n't been very much tested since the beginning of the tournament . is it a good point because you keep energy , or bad because you would like to have a big fight to prepare for the big moments ?

could you sense her getting frustrated during the match ?
monday is chinese new year . obviously , you 're playing sara errani . how will you celebrate ?
how did your week in auckland help you prepare for the australian open ?
you did a great video in auckland where you dressed up like jayz . have you started listening to any more rap music ?

greta said it was an honor to play you . how does it make you feel when people say things like that ?
you said you were n't quite at your best tonight . where do you think you need to improve ?
you missed the smash in the first set . can you talk us through that one .
you 've come through this tournament quite easily in your first three matches . other grand slams you 've had battles in the opening rounds . do you think you need one of those really tough matches in the early rounds to help you , or are you happy progressing simply ?
you won 61 , 61 tonight . before the match you said you were jokey smurf . what would the serious smurf 's scoreline look like ?
you 're the last remaining american in the tournament . are you aware of that ?
john was eliminated yesterday , mentioned his disappointment how americans had performed here . how do you sum it up ?
when you say you fly the flag , does that weigh on your mind or do you think about that a little bit , alone representing the states ?

what course is this ?
two ?

pretty good . first three matches , lost five games .
yesterday bernard tomic said during a match there 's 15,000 people making noise , he does n't hear anything during the point . is that something that comes naturally to you since you were young ?
kim said last night , she has n't played as much as you , over the last year when she came back on tour after her retirement she pretty much felt like she knew how to play . once she got back on court she could read things better because she was n't such a young player anymore , so there was no panic . do you feel the same way ?
even playing sporadically , not having any warmup matches coming in here , hitting the ground running .
she also said it 's an accumulation , meaning she understands her own game much better . i assume from 2004 wimbledon till now you have a much better understanding of what you can and ca n't do .
given you have n't played much since october , would you have preferred to have been tested a little bit more than you have done in the first week ?

are you glad he 's not here today ?
it 's a good book . pretty heavy .
today when maria had the medical timeout you had your head in a towel . you obviously were on a massive roll and could n't make a mistake . what were you thinking when your head was in the towel ?
did you feel like you were particularly in the zone today ? she was n't moving that well obviously , but you were striking the ball so cleanly .
do you feel like you kind of go into a certain place or certain zone out on the court ? you put on such a different demeanor . you have your game face of sorts .
in matches like the one against carla where you sort of lose your way , you have a streaky set , how do you pull yourself back into the match mentally ?
how important is the olympics you to this year ? obviously grand slams are the pinnacle of tennis , but the olympics is a worldwide event .
how much have you been paying attention to other players ' results here so far ?
were you happy with the way you closed it out ?
tell us about calling the doctor , what you were feeling at that time .
been a while since you made it to the quarterfinals of a grand slam . how much does winning that next match mean to you ?
how much do you credit your form here to spending so much time in australia beforehand ?
is there something about your preparation this time that 's made you go well ?

anyone in particular you think should give modeling a go ?
you did n't get to play in the beijing olympics because of an injury . how much are the london games this summer a goal for you ?
can you tell us how valuable nigel 's experience in the women 's game is to you ?
why did you choose him and how long before you actually hooked up together did you identify him as a coach you wanted to work with ?
did you have a specific goal here for the australian open when you sat down with him ?
can you give us an idea of what areas of your game nigel has helped you the most with ?
you just spoke about defending the colors of your country . will you be on the fed cup team in two weeks ?
it depends on what happens next week ?
talk about what happened out there today .
was it her speed or the angles she was getting ?
this obviously is n't the australian open you wanted . you 've been down here a long time in australia training . you seemed happy with your form before in perth and sydney . how do you rate this month as a whole for you ?
does this make the loss easier to accept , that she played so well today ?
is there any advice you would give her future opponents ? if she keeps playing the way she is , is she unbeatable ?
you mentioned errani . how much had you looked ahead in your draw ?
how did you feel out there ?
did the score in the first set look easier than it actually was ?
do you think at all about the whole no.1 situation , or just not in your mind ?
you seem to come in quite a few times during this match , more than we normally see you do . are you starting to feel more comfortable at the net ?
change for more reach ?
how difficult was it to restart the match after you knew that she was quite injured ?
for you now , momentum , what do you do tomorrow ? have a hit up ? try and get a couple of hours out of yourself ? was n't really a full match tonight , obviously .
next round is against kim in a replay of last year 's final . how does that prospect feel ?
you 've been training in munich , i think .
was it with mllerwohlfahrt ?
it was not with a doctor ?
what do you think you have to do against clijsters to beat her ?
what did you learn from the last final here ?
if i remember well , last year you forget about your wedding anniversary .
you are going to remember this time ?
you are a player who enjoys the stage a lot . were you happy of the upgrade to laver ?
do you think you play better on big courts than you do on small courts ?
what can you take from a match like that ? it was a big win . can you get anything out of it ?
now you 're facing caroline wozniacki in the next round . it 's a big challenge . what are your thoughts on that ?
the coach that caroline has now , ricardo sanchez , the coach you had last year , how did that change happen , and you do you want any revenge on him ?
there 's a big matchup with a former no.1 against the current no.1 . does that add anything to it for you , this chance to knock off a no.1 in at slam ?
before your match against caroline you have mixed doubles tomorrow with bernard . what are you looking for in that ?
do you feel like you expect , you know , a lot of pressure playing with him ?
there was a mixup where bernard said he forget to sign you up . what happened there ?
the tournament helped you out and saved you there .
did you have a chance to give him a hard time or yell at him about forgetting ?
you beat caroline in your first four meetings , and she beat you in the latest three here . is there anything that shifted the balance between you , something you can think of ?
what do you think caroline 's weaknesses are ? how will you try to exploit them ?
every time caroline comes in here , she gets asked about being no.1 and not winning a grand slam title . can yousympathize with the extra pressure that that brings ?
a bit of a patchy performance tonight .
the unforced errors , pretty high rate tonight .
did you closely watch the match tonight between the other two girls ?
regarding the opponent you faced tonight and the one you have to face in the next round , do you think you got a pretty tough draw ?
do you think match play is overrated for veteran players ? you and maria and serena all come in with very little and you 're all winning .
so since obviously this year is probably going to be your last year , do you think to yourself when you 're on court , i pretty much hit any top level , or do you think maybe if i played another year i can improve more ? is there more tennis left in you or was last year , australian open and maybe this year , as good as it will ever get for you ?
no problem with the hip ?
do you think li na is a different player compared to last year mentally , considering she 's a grand slam winner right now ?
how did you see the match ?
you seemed quite wound up toward the end , almost angry . can you tell us what was going on ?
is that something you 're conscious of doing , playing on emotion ?
what are your bad emotions ?
did you have your coffee this morning ?
we did n't see you the other night after the dellacqua match . how did you feel about the crowd when they were mimicking you ?
do you hear it ?
so not distracting at all ? never been distracted by any of that ?
how better equipped are you to maybe go on and win a slam at the start of this year than you were 12 months ago ?
the physical improvement is down to the team you have around you at the moment ?
where did you do the work in the offseason ?
but the real hard work was where , dubai ?
you have your headphones on when you come on court . what songs are getting you going ?
is that part of getting you into the match mode ?
what can you say about the next match ?
sum up your progress in with grand slams so far ? are you happy with the progress you 've made ? could you have done better ?
tougher in the second set . how did you see it ?
the ankle is okay after the tumble ?
did you twist the ankle to go down or were you just off balance ? any extra pain ?
it was n't any great concern ?
you still got a good ankle ?
there 's been a lot made of your physical wellbeing . do you feel that 's your biggest opponent at the moment ?
have you seen your mixed doubles draw ?
you two been talking strategy at all yet ?
have you picked ?
do you feel your forehand is stronger than his ?
where did you beat him ?
he going to serve first ?
plan any celebrations when you win a match ?
500 wins , that 's a huge number . does it feel that way to you ?
do you remember the first win ?
do you remember your first win here in '98 ?
was that a bit of a revenge match for the family ?
you said you like to emulate venus , getting to 500 after she got to 500. she has a lot more than that now . is that the next target for you ?
would venus have been awake watching ?
have you texted her or been in touch with her since then ?
did you have a wta mentor when you came on tour ?
do you ever think you would want to have more of a role in nurturing the young americans ?
is there anything you miss about being 16 ?
there 's a youtube video of you attempting the roger federer trick shot . the guy has the bottle on his head . you went quite low . what happened there ?
any thoughts about players breaking their racquets on the court ? do you think that helps out ?
baghdatis broke four racquets in one minute last night .
do you draw a lot of satisfaction from a match like that ?
it 's not a real test for you .
can you tell yet where your level is or you need to be pushed and tested more ? can you feel how you 're hitting the ball at this point or not yet ?
how do you feel on court ? how do you feel you 're striking the ball ?
and that approach is working for you , better to feel fit and strong rather than having a lot of matches under your belt ?
with the time change , your schedule , sasha 's schedule , do days go by where you have no contact with him ?
you get it done ?
after the events of last night , baghdatis breaking his racquet , how do you feel about breaking your racquet on court ?
serena williams was afraid of the bugs out on center court . just wondering , are you afraid of insects or anything like that ?
i am actually a little bit .
do you have any phobias like that ?
it 's been pointed out that a fifth of the women 's matches in the last several days have opponents winning one or two games . today you had a pretty good run . serena just bageled her opponent , as well . what is your comment about the depth of the women 's tour at the moment ?
not stronger or weaker than necessarily any other time in your career ?
what keeps you going ? those next grand slam opportunities ?
yes .
do you have any mixed doubles aspirations ?
who could you see yourself playing with ?
have you talked to alex , dmitry , any of those guys ?
they say the world is going to end this year . what would you like to do or achieve before the world blows up ?
sorry , it 's just our show .
the mayan calendar predicts it . there 's no real proof .
did you have a mentor when you came on tour , someone assigned to you ?
what do you mean ? how so ?
was there anybody that was playing that helped break you into the tour when you came on , an older player ?
have you talked to them about being on tour or have they talked to you ?
she gave you quite a good fight out there .
is she a tough opponent to get to go away ? she just seems to always be there .
is it good for you to have a test ?
and the next match ?
when you go through those streaks where you 're making a lot of mistakes , what is going through your mind when that 's happening ?
have you gotten used to being the wimbledon champion ? you seemed , particularly there , more of a private person . you do n't care much about the notoriety , you care about the tennis .
i 've heard you say before you do n't like to look at rankings too much . after all the success you 've had , it must be nice to look at rankings now .
would you give any thought to the fact that you could be one of the players that leaves here with the no.1 ranking ?
seems to be quite an easy win for you . was it like that ?
were you afraid of her service because when it worked you had a lot of pressure ?
it seems the game you are playing suits the surface well .
you seem much more sure of yourself and calm compared to last year against makarova .
is part of that making the game plan a little more simple than complicated ?
can you hear what the fans are saying in the crowd ? if so , what are they saying to you ?
caroline has been trying a little bit of golf . she 's had a good teacher . how about you ?
is adam going to be able to come and watch you ?
what is he like at tennis ?
serena got a bit scared of the insects out on court . are you afraid of bugs at all ?
so you played on a court with snakes ?
here in australia ?
you swim in australia , but you 're still afraid of sharks ?
marcos baghdatis smashed four racquets last night in one minute . when is the last time you smashed a racquet , and have you ever smashed that many ?
the crowd last night when azarenka was playing , they were imitating her constantly every point , the grunt . have you ever been in a situation where the crowd was so on you that you got uncomfortable ?
on your team , which you 've changed at times . i know you 're comfortable now with nigel . is part of the reason why you changed the team is because you 're a little bit impatient with them helping you to get further ?
do you like being the boss or do you let your mom make the big decisions about that ?
in brisbane , nigel came onto the court a lot to discuss tactics with you midset . he ca n't do that in a grand slam . does that affect you at all that you do n't have that interaction with him during the match ?
they say the world is going to end this year . what would you like to do before the world explodes ?
must be a little frustrating . feel like you take a couple of steps forward and then a couple steps back . how did you see it ?
i suppose you did n't shake off that 2009 quarterfinal ?
the other day when you were in here you talked about staying positive , chilling out . can you still stay positive after tonight ?
the nerves were n't a factor at all for you ?
where are you heading off to next ?
what do you feel let you down tonight ?
off the topic of tonight 's match , how much did tennis play a role in helping you find your place as an australian when you first came ?
first came to australia .
but later on when you started playing , turned professional , was that a major factor in feeling at home here in australia ?
do you have any sort of feelings towards the way some of the greek supporters and serbian supporters get a little overenthusiastic during the tennis ?
could you tell us what happened ? what was wrong with your game ? thoughts on the game ?
what was wrong with your game ? was it not working ?
what was the toughest out there ?
what do you think you 've been able to learn from it in a positive way that shows you what you have to do to step up ?
you were having trouble with the ball toss .
how do you feel you 're progressing ?
she 's a grand slam winner . what does she have that you have n't at the moment ?
did you watch her final last year ?
is it possible to put into words to watch someone on the tv and then actually be on the other side of the net playing them ?
the biggest match of your life so far . did you sleep okay last night ?
apart from the result , did you enjoy the experience of being out there ?
what 's ahead for you ? how are you structuring your schedule ?
is able to travel with you ?
staying up to watch her tonight ?
do you have a ranking goal ?
how was the match for you today ? it looked very straightforward .
does it give you a good feeling to be back on this court where you did so well last year ?
you looked like you 've become a lot stronger since last year . do you spend a lot of time in the gym ?
extra work ?
so was it nice to be away from all the attention in germany ? it was quiet over there ?
how is the knee ?
your thoughts on the match .
looked like you were trying to stay aggressive in it . must have been frustrating you could n't quite make a difference because she was hitting it so well , was n't she ?
can that sort of game give you a bit of a drive for what you need to do for the rest of the year ?
do you feel like playing fed cup again ? do you want that opportunity ?
do you feel like you 've come a long way ? do you feel like you have come a long way from where you were ?
do you know your program after here ?
what is your next trick with the fans ? what are you going to ask them to do next ?
it was all fairly comfortable today .
do you take much notice of rankings ?
does n't mean anything ?
have you ever ?
2003 is a long time ago , when you first became no.1 , and did so without having won a major . what is your memory of it ? was it a burden ?
a few players have followed in the same vein who have n't won a major . have you spoken to caroline , jelena , about not winning a grand slam and being no.1 ?
are you a type of player who looks at the draw before the tournament starts ? if so , did you look at yours ? what do you think of it ?
have you seen the latest tin tin movie , and do you think it 's belgian enough ?
are you a fan ?
moved pretty well , hit fairly well . assess how you felt out there .
talk about coming off the injury .
you were n't favoring the ankle at all ?
was it a good match to have from that point of view ?
does the leg start to bother you ?
were the bugs a bit of a distraction ?
one game where you did n't have to move a lot was when you hit four aces in 60 seconds . have you done that before ?
was the way you had your leg taped differently to the way you 've had it done in the past ?
if you ever lose a firstround match at a slam , is that time to retire ?
the streak goes on and on .
did you ever get an answer to your twitter question ?
you and andy have n't signed up for mixed yet officially . are you planning on doing that ?
there 's more doubt now ?
that was a nasty sprain in brisbane , pretty extreme . are you surprised you 're able to move as well as you did tonight ? how hard was it to get yourself to this stage ?
you do n't talk about your injuries too much . what did you do that was unusual ?
in terms of therapy ?
must be a lot of ice ?
basically sleeping in an ice bath ?
what are your thoughts , sam ?
when did you feel like it was slipping away ? was it the tiebreaker ?
how much do the expectations play a part ?
is it almost a physical burden ? you looked tight in the shoulders . do n't look like yourself .
what do you tell your fans when they ask , what happened in brisbane , sydney , melbourne ?
when you are struggling , how many competing voices do you have in your head ? your coach , your own views , people in the locker room . how crowded does it get in there in terms of the advice ?
do you think there was n't enough time to turn it around mentally after sydney ?
when do you start to lose faith it will happen for you here ?
what do you feel like doing over the next two weeks ? getting back out there in the gym and ripping in or stepping away and having a bit of a break ?
how anxious were you beforehand ? did you wake up in the middle of the night worrying about it or were you quite calm ?
will you pay attention to what 's going on now that you 're out of it ?
yesterday , did you see anything of tomic 's match ? did you hear what happened ? did you read the press ? was there more pressure on you in a way because of the enthusiasm that he created , you wanted to do the same ?
when you talk about needing to take control in a match , be more aggressive , work on the mental side , what can you do to turn that around ? that 's not something you can hit the gym and go out and hit the court to improve . what can you do to change that ?
this question may sound cruel , but when you get such a big disappointment like tonight , do you get close to crying or you make an effort not to ?
there 's been a trend of players on the women 's side who win a grand slam having almost a hangover at the next one . do you feel that 's a factor for you ?
the other night on tv , your us open final was on . you played unbelievably well . reminded everyone how good you could play . coming back here , is it just trying too hard to show australia how good you could play ? you were a different player today .
this morning , jarmila was critical the way her game is perceived . having seen what she went through at hopman cup , do you get together with her and have a chat ? she 's obviously struggling a bit .
people say she plays crap . she ca n't win . she hits 40 unforced errors .
do you want to break it down ? it 's been a while since you played . talk about how you struck the ball , movement , all that .
did you have fear of the ankle ?
or when you went out , did you feel you practiced hard enough ?
it was pretty hot out there . how did it affect you ?
i know she beat you at wimbledon . you played exhibitions with her . is that familiarity level , you kind of know what 's coming ?
walking on the court , talk about what kind of feeling do you get ? is the excitement still there ? you ca n't wait to start ?
back to what you said before , you 've been on the tour now a while . do you feel like you need a lot of matches going into tournaments , or are you experienced enough now and you 've obviously hit enough balls in training where you feel you can go out there and it does n't matter as much ?
i 'm guessing you do n't know much about your next opponent .
your thoughts on the match ?
did you find it hard to shake her in some of those close ones ?
how did you find the conditions , the weather ?
but you were happy when you realized you were scheduled for a morning game on such a hot day ?
it was n't too tough , the conditions ? you were okay ?
nice way to start the tournament .
you 've had a lot of tough first rounds in the slams . how do you avoid going out there and getting nervous and losing control of your game ?
i read a lot about what you said about the offseason . took a tough loss to kim , maybe did n't play the week later . coming into the tournament , do you really feel like your game is close to where you want it to be ?
have you set yourself any targets for this year ?
building blocks , consistency is important . the last couple years you 've had some good times and then go down .
so being much more patient , you 're saying that you do n't need to hit the winner in two shots , you can go five or six shots every point ?
you 've been here two months now ?
how is it not to be home at all during the holidays ? that must have been strange .
fitnesswise , was the emphasis strength or speed or endurance ?
could you be happy if you did n't get back to the top ? do you need to get back to close to no.1 to be a happy person ?
you served really well today . is that something you 've been working on ? you did n't face a breakpoint the entire match .
talk us through that match .
how frustrating is it when you know you 're good enough and could n't put it together ?
can you put your finger on why you find it so hard to win here ?
where to now ? what can you do ? do you get away from tennis for a while ? what do you want to do ?
you do n't see any reason to try to maybe become 10 % more conservative in your play ?
how tough is it when everyone questions the way you play ?
how much does that play on your mind when you go into the game ?
is there someone that you can talk to ?
talk about maybe trying to change the way you go into a game .
why do you think there 's that lack of support ? pretty emotional year . do you think all that 's related ?
is your confidence in yourself still at the same level ?
do you think you take too much notice of what everyone else thinks ? is it a matter of not watching the tv , the papers , doing your own thing ?
how did you find the conditions today ?
happy to be playing in the morning rather than the afternoon ?
fantastic win . you must be thrilled .
significantly easier than the other time you met her . did it surprise you ?
have you set yourself any targets for this year ?
you lost heavily in sydney , but seem to have turned those things around pretty quickly .
you looked so in control of those nerves today .
what has louise been bringing to the table ?
you mentioned staying positive . is that something you 've got better at , in life and even in matches ?
you sound like you 're in a good place .
is it nice to fly under the radar ?
you spoke briefly on the conditions . was it a combination of heat and wind ?
were you disturbed by your hair ? you have beautiful long hair . sometimes this caused a little problem or not ?
how big a win is this for you ?
when you 're on the other side of the net , can you tell when an opponent is really struggling mentally or with their confidence as opposed to just their physical game ?
you know that sam is loved here in australia . do you think she was stressed today ?
what did you find the crowd like ?
what was your plan ?
when you speak about a coach , you had an italian . do you have a new one ?
not the beautiful man with brown hair who was very happy when you scored a point ? that 's not the coach ?
you were talking about the wind . you would think with center court it would be quite shielded from the wind . when you were down there , was it gusting and blowing ?
is it more difficult to come from romania and become a tennis player , or the past champions like tiriac and nastase somehow helped the tennis to grow ? do you have any help in your country by the federation or someone else ?
your parents are not a customer of the tiriac bank ?
anne keothavong tweeted to you , congratulations , you do n't need big muscles to spank the ball like her . what do you think that means ?
what was your reaction when you found out that you are going to play stosur in the first round ?
there 's a lot of focus on german players . there 's other players from romania . what do you think that means for romanian tennis ? do you work together well ?
is there a reason why there are no men from romania apart from hanescu on the tennis courts ?
no one seems to be playing like the other one ?
there is not a school ?
how did you feel about your form today ? got off to a slower start , then really dominated in the second set .
you seemed to be distracted by something in the stands near the end of the first set .
is there any added pressure for you playing another french player ?
so you think it was emotional to come back after the injury that happened last year ?
it was almost a perfect way to start the tournament .
this is about the second or third time you played second in a night session at a slam . does that sound about right ? the other time you did it was at the us open . is it something when you get started that late you have an incentive to get home ?
who are players who you see before you in the schedule and you know someone is going to take a long time ?
do you have any other plans for your night now that you 're done ?
what is that ?
any problems with the wrist at all ?
it seemed to get stronger as the match went on .
can you talk about some of the improvements you made to your game in the past year ?
have you been working on mixing in some different types of shots ?
how hard were the conditions out there today ?
in the second set , did you sense she was struggling a bit with the heat ?
what were you most happy with in regards to your game today ?
how much confidence did you bring in from your win last week ?
do you have any extra confidence being a returning finalist ? do you feel as good this year as you did last year playing in the tournament ?
was there anything last year off the court that you did that you 're trying to replicate here to have similar success ?
no superstition ?
did you have some trouble concentrating today at certain points in the match ? i know you had some breakpoints that you did not win . did you have some troubles with concentration at all ?
today .
relief ? satisfaction ? pleasure ? what does it feel like ?
anything different from her game at brisbane ?
you look in great shape . would you say you 're the fittest you 've ever been ?
the periods you spent out of the game the last couple years , what did you do to keep yourself occupied ?
changed your hair color since brisbane ?
did anybody recognize you when you came in the players ' lounge ?
do you do it better now after the classes ?
big prospect next round , no.3 in the world .
did that feel like a nice way to start the tournament ?
did you have nerves going out on the court ?
did you watch videotapes of your opponent or talk to someone who played her ?
how is your hip ?
what was the problem , looking back ? was it a serious issue that made you pull out ?
you 've had injuries before . how do you go out there saying you 're going to play a hundred percent , not worry about an injury ?
when you went on court , are you thinking about third set of the final last year , raising the trophy ? what came back into your mind ?
today .
do you have any particular ways of coping when there 's a long match before your own ?
is your serve to the point where you 're happy with it ? you were talking last year about not being too pleased . and are you comfortable hitting all your shots yet or are you thinking match by match you 'll be comfortable with everything ?
you fought hard in the second set . does it give you a lot of hope how close you are to getting what you want ?
did you have any nerves at the very start ?
what do you think is the biggest thing you 'll take out of this match going forward ?
what is your schedule now after the australian open ?
you 're playing juniors here , too ?
when will you know ? what is stopping it , the doubles schedule ?
your form is obviously good . is it a bit difficult with a match like that when you perhaps could have used something a bit more testing ?
you had sort of a strange 2011. in a way , it 's been your best year , but also had a lot of injuries and some withdrawals . any of these injuries concerning , longterm , or things that come up and can be fixed ?
the confidence from the year , the mental side of things , the way you played last year has obviously helped give you a lot of confidence , i imagine .
what did you think of your opponent today ? she had one very good game , and then you rather dominated her . did you think she looked like a decent prospect ?
is 2012 a year where you think you should say to yourself , now it 's time to take the next step and consistently challenge for grand slam finals ?
is the no.1 ranking one of your goals as well ?
with your results last week and then the way you played this morning , do you think this is your best chance to finally crack a grand slam ?
you 're striking the ball consistently well the last couple weeks . that must give you a lot of confidence .
how did you feel today ? sleepy ? awake ? energetic ?
want to talk about the match ? she seems pretty consistent . it 's kind of hard to execute against her . she does n't seem to be missing as much as maybe a year or so ago .
was there any time during the match where you felt like , okay , now i 'm in here ? you made a bit of a push there in the second set . she seemed to respond pretty well .
when you are playing someone who is so solid and you talk about making too many errors , do you try to be more aggressive or try to shorten points or hang in longer rallies ? do you have to choose one or the other ?
is there any weakness you can spot at all ?
let 's face it , you 're known for very good reason for your pride . is it fair to say in terms of victoria now , four straight tournaments , 23 straight matches , some really big wins , does the wta now finally have a dominant player , or is it too early to say that ?
you talked about her confidence and movement and so forth . what do you think the reason is she 's sort of stepped up early in the year now in her play ?
you had some downs during the tournament , big comebacks , did n't get the result you wanted today , but how do you feel about your game going into miami ?
when you were at the top and pretty much beating everyone let 's just say when you were at the top did you feel like you had to beat every single other player to feel like you were dominant ? for example , azarenka has n't played , serena this year , she has n't played kvitova , she has n't played wozniacki . or do you just measure yourself , this is what 's in front of me ?
that trophy looks very heavy .
almost perfect match again for you ; few unforced errors ; you dictated pretty much ; did n't let her into the match . seems like you get in these big spots now and you ca n't seem to lose .
we were talking in the press room , and no one can figure out how anybody can beat you . how do you think anybody can ever beat you the way you 're playing now ?
it 's no secret that many players atop the wta rankings in recent years have struggled either to stay there or to win slams . you 've won a slam and now you seem to be staying there and using no.1 as a springboard in a very confident way . why do you think you 've been able to handle being no.1 , or it seems that way , in comparison with others ?
talk about just being no.1 . is that something that you 're comfortable with , that feels good , or ...
what were the conditions out there in the second set ? as you 're trying to wrap it up , it 's getting cloudier and darker . were you trying to get it in before the rain comes ? were you thinking about that at all ?
this time last year at this tournament you were forced to retire against caroline . you win miami , and from time pretty much to here you 've kind of gotten rid of the retirements and a lot of the injuries . talk about that . because 20092010 was n't so easy for you physically . now that you 're healthy , seems like you 're able to winch more consistently now .
obviously you 've been winning a lot . there are a few players you do n't have winning records against : caroline , venus , kvitova . do you want to face those players and challenge yourself ?
specifically what did you learn from that tough go with serena at the open ? how will you play against her the next time you face her ?
you say being no.1 is just a number . what 's the nicest thing about being no.1 ?
you have handled maria and she 's a tough opponent , but in finals before you 've handled her and you were able to move her side to side pretty effectively . is that a matchup , because of your mobility , that you relish that moment with her ?
your winning streak has been compared to novak 's last year . one of the questions with novak last year was going into the clay where he had never done that great as to whether or not he could sustain it ; he did all the way up through roland garros . with you , you 've been a great hard court player , maybe not done so well on clay . can you talk about the challenge of playing in clay and winning big tournaments on clay ?
what tournament will you play on clay before the french open ?
three ?
earlier in the week you were asked whether you were going to go undefeated this year , and you laughed . so are you ready now to do it ?
you seem very happy these days . is this really a lot of fun for you , the winning , the no.1 , the undefeated ? does it improve you , you know , sort of as a person , mood , all of that ?
she kind of came out firing a bit .
took you a while to get back in there . there was that real critical game in the second set , and seemed like after you got that things switched again .
when she was called for that hindrance on that one point , tapping her racquet , did you notice that ? was that annoying to you ?
that also meant , maria , did you notice when she hit the racquet on the ground three times ?
oh , you did ?
but did it really bother you , or did you just notice she did it and got ready again ?
did you think at one time that you were going to lose the game ?
both today and during your fourth round match , it took you a while to get into the game . the first few games you missed all the shots and so on . have you thought about it ? do you think there is a particular reason , environment , you 're more warmed up now ?
you go 42 in the second , and all of a sudden you 're 55 and are able to get up to 75 and then pretty much take over . what 's your mindset after you lose those two and then you get ahead to finish out the second set ?
with all you 've gone through coming back from an injury that maybe no one else has in the sport , what would it mean to you to become no.1 again , maria ?
where do you think your shot is ? do you think you have a pretty good chance now ?
ivanovic says that what she remembers of the aussie open final last time you played was crying on a bad dropshot she had . want to talk about some of your memories which are obviously more positive than that ?
she was laughing , too .
on a very serious topic , what 's happening with the candy , sugapova ?
yeah .
what kind of candy is it ?
is that cool ? is it gon na be cutting edge design ? are you going to be on the packages ?
what 's the timetable for it to debut ?
are you gon na share it with the press corps or not ?
were you talking to the chair ump about the spider cam ?
it does n't remind you of big brother or anything ?
you seemed unusually subdued on court even when you won . is it just kind of an allbusiness attitude ?
even when you were getting on a roll there you seemed businesslike . is it just ...
nothing is weighing on you or anything like that ?
i wondered , for you , what was the biggest change that enabled you to ultimately take control of the match ?
is it of concern you played for three hours ? you seem pretty fresh .
so physically ...
in between the second and third set ?
playing the same player so many times all these different tournaments , how much of a motivating factor can revenge be for you ?
her and in general .
are you conscious about it being a factor on your opponent 's side , as well ? you and ivanovic have n't played since the australian open final .
you must be very pleased . can you tell us what you particularly liked with your game today ?
before you broke her game you talked to your coach . what kind of magic words did he give to you ?
when you have so much success early in your career and then when you start kind of on this way back , how difficult is it mentally to realize that you 've got the potential to get back to where you were ?
you talked about revenge for both wozniacki earlier this year and bartoli last year . how much do you think about that when you 're preparing for the match or when you 're on the court ?
is the reason her ball is faster than it looks because her technique is so unusual ?
when bartoli took that timeout in the second set , did she explain what was going on ? what did you understand of the situation ?
there have been times over the last few years when you 've talked about playing aggressive , and you actually have played aggressive but the balls were n't staying in the court necessarily . so what 's the difference now when you 're playing aggressive and actually keeping them inside ?
what did he do specifically with your forehand ? he said what , bend lower or you 're not following through enough or what ?
is there anybody else you want revenge on in the near future ?
how many people do you have in your team now ? how many people are traveling with you ?
is that it ?
are you comfortable with some kind of smaller team ?
are you still talking to that doctor in australia , the woman orthopedist ?
does she give you a program of what you need to do ?
so what are you doing during the tournaments ?
you were mentioning the other day the infidel , the book you 're reading . can you tell us a little bit more about how you select your reading material ? do you get recommendations from friends ? book reviews ? wander around the bookstore looking at things ? and also , do you try to alternate between serious and more entertaining stuff ? infidel is pretty heavy .
it 's incredible , if you think about it , that you have n't play sharapova since the australian open final four years ago .
given that you 've both been on tour a while and you 're grand slam champions , do you want to talk about specifically your feelings towards her and how her game has evolved and if you play her what you think you have to do ?
what do you remember from that australian open final ? it 's been a while now .
it was on the break point ?
so you still have nightmares about thatshot ?
in a respectful way though do you remember the semifinal with the squeaky shoes ?
on purpose ?
sorry to hear you 're not feeling well . can you just tell me a bit about what happened in the match ?
do you have a temperature right now ?
after having such a good tournament here and great results again at indian wells , it must be a frustrating way for it to end .
are you sick or did she just play great and you did n't play quite how you would have liked ?
so was there ways you thought you could get into the match and she just got every ball in the court ?
how big a difference was it for you to get those two games ? you seemed very excited .
that 's what you were thinking at 60 , 50 ?
you played her now four times this year . in those matches against vika , is she getting better ? are you seeing that her game is actually improving as the year goes along , or it 's just kind of the same level and kind of depends on your level more ?
were you close to crying ?
you 've only lost four matches all year but all to the same player ; is that frustrating for you ?
for any good player , just hearing the ball come off the racquet is important . you learn a lot just from hearing the sound . in melbourne i think you said her sounds were just too loud . do you think that in any way that 's a hindrance , and do you think anything should be done about it ?
so you do n't think it 's a hindrance ? is that what you 're saying ? or you 're just dealing with it ?
this match feel more personal to you today than before ?
because you two had disagreements about what happened in doha .
are you positive that you can close the gap between you and her ?
can you find a way to get back to where you 're playing her even ?
you said you can laugh or cry when things are n't going your way . tennis is such a mental game . you 're out there with yourself . what goes through your mind when you 're having a real tough situation ? what kind of talk ? what kind of talk to yourself goes through your head ?
she 's undefeated this year . i mean , can you say anything that 's separating her from the other players right now ? what do you think she 's doing that 's keeping her above ?
is there anyone on tour right now who you think can beat her if she plays her best ?
even though today was not a great day for you , next ranking you move up to no.4 . is that your highest career ranking ? does that keep you feeling good about where you 're headed ?
do you feel bad that you passed caroline ?
tough one , caroline . want to talk about it ?
just talk about ...
just talk about how you felt and all that .
how much better was her level today than it was doha ? her level .
you looked pretty upset . is it because you were unable to push yourself forward the way you wanted to when you knew she was playing at a certain level ?
can i ask , at the beginning of the tournament you were saying that you were willing to take the things in practice that were new and try to bring them into matches . at times during this tournament you looked like it , but at other times looked like you were kind of hesitating and going back to things that maybe were n't working for you .
any changes to the schedule coming up , or are you going to stick with the same thing ?
what did your dad say after the match ?
yeah .
you 're probably more upset with yourself than he was .
could have been dicey , but you seemed to control the match pretty well .
during practice coming into the tournament , you obviously hit the ball well in australia up until the final . then maybe not so well a little bit after that . but what were you working on ? do you feel you have a rhythm and feel and all that ?
you had a situation in the previous match where everything was flowing so easily , and then suddenly you got a bit tight toward the end of the second set . when you get into the next round , a match like today where it 's going so easily , do you think back , wow , got a little tight in the previous one ; when i 'm in this situation i 've really got to knuckle down and focus or do what ? i do n't know .
dancing with the stars , how do you think martina navratilova will do ?
you think ?
would you ever go on a show like that if you were asked to ?
did lack of fitness actually hurt you in australia ? because you played pretty well , great win over kvitova . or were you thinking in the final the footwork was n't there ? you were n't quick enough ? did you feel yourself getting tired ?
when was the first time you met kirilenko ?
when you guys were playing against each other or were on a team or something ?
so you guys becamefriends ? you might play her in the next round . so you became friends pretty quickly ?
i think you 're exactly the same age , 24 .
are you planning to play more fed cup this year ?
after the olympics , if russia makes the final , would you play ?
you know , both petrova and kirilenko very well ; you have had a lot of matches with them .
can there be anything new in a match , or do you know each other so well it 's basically going to be all execution ?
did you finish 1984 ?
thoughts ?
you did n't expect that , huh ?
but you liked it ?
today was obviously a tough match with jamie . what are your thoughts about your game and her game and how they matched up ?
what about her game kind of troubled you in that second set ?
did you see her cramp , or what were your thoughts when you noticed that she had fallen to the court ?
has that ever happened to you , someone playing you or you had surrendered two games just to get a medical timeout ?
looking ahead , what are you going to work on as the road gets tougher ahead , especially after a tough match like this ? how are you preparing for your next match ?
have you looked to see who you 're playing yet ?
they have relatively similar game styles , hard hitting from the baseline . what are you going to do to combat that ?
must be nice to get this far . i know you 've struggled at this tournament in the past . must be nice to get to the quarterfinals now .
why do you think you 're having more success here this year than you have in past years ?
i happened to go by your practice session yesterday , and it looked like you were hitting a lot of serves . were you unhappy with the way you served in the first serve , or were you just looking for some more power in the next few rounds ?
any thoughts about your next round ?
an unusual question . we know in tennis there is lots of luck : let cord , the draw , the weather , schedule . in your life , do you consider yourself a lucky person ?
do you feel that you were lucky to be born in your culture , what is it , 29 years ago ?
that was the fake question .
do you do things to bring yourself good luck ? do you light off fireworks on chinese new year ? do you do things to bring yourself good luck ? do you light off fireworks at chinese new year ?
it is the most relaxed competition this time ?
it 's very easy for you , i think .
which match during this time do you think is most difficult for you ?
how about you and zheng jie the 11th , the day before yesterday ?
two days ago you have match with zheng jie , right ?
how about that match ?
if you could , for the fun of it , go back and play anybody in the history of the game , who would you choose to have a match with who you have not played ?
there is a virus that 's been here that people have been getting sick . have you taken any precautions to make sure you did n't get sick like the other players ?
there 's a dancing competition in america called dancing with the stars .
monica seles danced there and starting monday martina navratilova .
would you ever consider going on tv and being in a dancing competition ?
yes .
question about the future : do you think that the olympics this year coming after wimbledon , will you feel less pressure than you did in beijing or will the surface make the olympics as difficult as beijing but for different reasons maybe ?
there was an incident last week regarding a french tennis player saying some things to some asian fans in the crowd . have you heard about it ? do you have any reaction about it ?
on a more fun note , been covering tennis for a long time , more than 29 years . there are many funny people , goran ivanisevic , marat safin . you 're so funny . have you always had the sense of humor ? why do you have this sense of humor ? why are you so funny ?
do you think you can carry this winning record forward this year like djokovic did last year on the men 's side ?
have there been any words on your side about the illness , because petra had to pull out yesterday ? what kind of precautions have you taken ?
so you 're the one who brought it here , victoria ? ( laughter . )
did you get it in dubai or when you came to the states ?
so mainly the women had it then ? the women had it before the tournament as opposed to the men then ?
looking back , do you think that had any effect on you , your first match in the tournament ?
what are your thoughts on playing agnieszka again for the fourth time already this year ?
when you 're playing this well and you get on the practice court , are you working on any new things or are you just trying to keep your game , you know , maintain the level that you have ?
why would you try to do things better when you 're undefeated ? seems to me like you 're tampering with perfection .
have you got a chance to talk with agnieszka about what happened in doha ? are you guys still friends ?
a lot of players , when they 're really young , like 16 , 17 , 18 , will say , i just want to play aggressive . if i play aggressive , i 'm going to win . but now at your stage of your career do you see the value in playing great defense , too ?
agnieszka is considered one of the smartest players out there . it seems like you 've kind of figured her out . is that because you 're a betterthinking player ? i do n't mean betterthinking player i 'm just wondering , are there things you have a figured out yourself about her game that you can exploit and then win ?
how many of these different tshirts do you have ? seems like every time i see you you have a different message on your tshirt . `` i got this '' ?
which is ?
do you have a tshirt for each match or each day ?
yeah , because it 's been a different one every time you have been in the media room .
does the `` i got this '' mean you pay the bill at every restaurant ?
what does your tshirt say ? we ca n't see it .
with your perfect record this year , is there one part of your game which has improved more than any other , do you think ?
with all your success in the shorts era , are you ever going to wear a skirt on court again , do you think ?
even if you had won 30 straight matches in the shorts you would stop wearing them ?
want to talk about the second set ?
is that hard to check yourself ? you say you were hitting it really well ...
when you are hitting that well you want to keep going but ...
can you talk about chelsea lately . everybody was talking about it . it was a huge hit . i thought the best part of it was about the sample size . are you guys friends ? have you met her before ?
personally and professionally everything seems to be going well for you . there is an ease about you . can you talk about that ? anything you want to share with us that we do n't know ?
i know your dad has taken a back seat , but he 's on the court with you sometimes . when you 're here , does he call you after matches and check in with you ?
what does he say ?
watch your footwork ?
would your mother have any insights at all about your tennis game ?
do you like that she does n't really know so much about tennis ? is that a nice buffer ?
speaking of hoopla , i believe you just went to maybe a vanity fair party . you have been living in los angeles . how would you compare the hoopla and pizazz in the entertainment world versus our little world of tennis with our own hangerson ?
there is a great player who came from siberia to florida without much money and worked her tail off and then won wimbledon as a teen . who would you like to play maria sharapova in the movies ?
how much chatter is there about this virus sweeping the area in the locker room ?
are you taking precautions of any kind ?
have you ever seen so many players go down from a single virus ?
when you write your book , which i 'm sure will be darn good , what 's going to be the most interesting chapter for us to read ?
will it be agassilike or spadealike ?
would you write beyond autobiography ? have you ever considered beyond the playing days of maybe writing other things ?
the matchup with vinci ? she seems to be playing pretty good ball .
what 's your assessment of the match ? what happened ?
you do n't feel well ?
are you sick like you 've been throwing up ?
seemed like after the first set the speed on your serve , on your first serve went way down . was it your back or shoulder , or you just did n't have energy and power ?
and in the forehand you could n't move your legs very well ; is that it ?
how much have you been able to train since getting the virus ? how many days have you been able to get back to practice ?
is it your achilles still ? is your leg okay , your achilles injury ?
she gets a lot of balls back ; she moves well ; what 's challenging about playing her ?
the sickness you got , is it related to your stomach like the players are getting here , or is it a different type of sickness ?
but when you were at home was it your stomach or just head ?
you won the biggest title in our sport . since then , what has been the single either most fun or most surprising thing that 's happened to you ?
yes , i do .
i know that mchale is not so tall , but did you feel that her groundstrokes or ball was pretty hard and pretty good ?
are you frustrated by your results in the u.s. hard courts ?
no problem with your breathing today ?
you seemed to be able to get out of trouble every time you were down a break . is that the case ?
can you look ahead to one of the next two that you play , azarenka or kuznetsova ?
if it 's azarenka , is there any kind of special motivation now that she 's no.1 and is on a streak to beat her ?
your countrywoman , petkovic , which i 'm probably mispronouncing , seems to have developed problems with her back from practicing too much . is that something you 're trying to avoid ?
how good a prospect do you think barthel is ?
mona .
i probably mispronounced it .
how old were you two when you started playing each other ?
does it go way back ?
we were talking to mona here the other day , and she said she thinks it 's coincidence that all of you german women are big women . is it ? one can think that germany has encouraged big girls to play tennis .
you 're not little .
you have n't played her in a while , but you did have a 14 record against her . this match , was it completely different ?
have you thought of possibly having an unbeaten season ?
you laugh , but in 1983 , martina navratilova was 861 ; in 1989 steffi graf was 862. just think , you could be the first one possibly to avoid defeat .
you know that they were amazing players .
it 's also possible to note that the depth of women 's tennis was n't what it was then as it is now , so do you think if you would put up a comparable record it would be a greater accomplishment ?
can you talk about playing this week how you 're enjoying the tournament at indian wells in general ?
you said your first match was not great , but do you think the match kind of brings the best out of you to help you to play better the next round ?
you were saying that you think that confidence is overrated . you said that before . can you talk about that a little bit ? because i think from a lot of us we are used to players saying that confidence is everything for them .
do you think belief is a better word ?
what word would you use to replace confidence ? but you 've already given us the answer .
if there have been instances where you were doing everything correctly , where you had the discipline and you did n't win the match , something went wrong , internally what do you attribute that to ?
can you talk about some of the development and a lot of the hard work you have been putting into and you 've always been one of the hard workers off the court anyway but can you talk about kind of your development , what 's changed ? what have you kind of been able to be more professional about maybe more so now than you were before ?
so we have our world no.1 and no.2 playing doubles together this week . everybody talk about rivalry between you two . is that possible that you pick up information between each other , like what does she like to do on the court ?
no , no , no , no . we are not professional players , so maybe it 's a stupid question . but is that possible , to get something helpful to your singles when you play each other ?
do you feel like today was a little bit of revenge for you from the french ?
it 's not that often you get quick victories where you 're only losing a few games . shows you 're in control almost the whole time .
how important are the olympics to you , especially given the fact that you got hurt right before the last one ?
when you were a little girl , did you look at the olympics the same way you looked at majors , or was it something totally separate ?
you did well in indian wells last year . is there something in the air here for you ?
do you know how many events you 'll play at the olympics ?
yeah .
you would n't play doubles with jelena or something ?
are you adjusting your schedule at all to kind of account for the extra tournament ?
a while ago you said you felt so old being 24. yet it does n't really seem to make sense . could you talk about that ?
how important is fed cup to you this year , because serbia is in the semifinals ? you did n't play the first round . are you making that a priority this year to give serbia a chance to win ?
it sounds like you 're not going to make a decision until after miami .
playing on clay ?
you won the french open . if you can just give one memory , what is your best moment in paris ?
do you know what you 're playing between olympics and the us open ?
you were talking at the beginning of the year about sort of changing the fitness idea where you were working on keeping healthy , right ?
making sure not to get hurt . is there a point now where you 're thinking , i have to get stronger or faster ? it looks like you 're moving very well , but maybe musclewise you 're not where you used to be ?
when you 're on the court , i 'm curious , how much energy do you draw from the crowd and the cheering that you hear while you 're also focusing on winning ?
with fed cup , if you were to go on to win it , how big a deal would that be when you look at what happened a couple years ago with the davis cup side ?
you have had some great wins , some real triumphs , but also some setbacks and tough stretches . if you go back in your career and change one or two things , ana , what would that be ?
do you blame anyone else for that , giving you the wrong advice , or do you think , i was just young and that was my fault and i was pushing myself too hard ?
you enjoyed a very comfortable victory today . have you given any thought towards your next potential encounter potentially against peng shuai ? you enjoyed a comfortable victory over her in carlsbad last year . any thoughts to that ?
just one of those bad days , jelena ?
have you had that problem here before of feeling kind of deadlegged ?
you sound like you have a cold or something .
you took a late wildcard into kuala lumpur and then obviously had to get over here . was that any effect on kind of your ability to transition ?
how much did you know about her going into the match ?
are you happy with your year so far ?
what is the status of that palatial mansion you were having constructed in rancho santa fe ?
your house .
have you considered maybe playing a reduced schedule this year ? you 're still playing a lot playing , almost every week , you know .
do you feel like you have to play fed cup ? meaning that your country is depending on you , so even if you 're not feeling great you 're going to go anyways ?
just a little off the match , what did you know about nick bollettieri before you went to bradenton , and what were your first impressions of him ? what had you heard about him before you went there , and when you first met him what were your impressions ?
do you want ana to play fed cup ?
why do n't you just ask her to play , to help out ?
did you set any goals at the beginning of the year ? are you rethinking them ?
now that he 's not working with caroline anymore , have you talked to ricardo sanchez about possibly working with him as a coach again ?
i 'm assuming this is kind of your biggest win on a stage like this .
how did that happen ? can you take us through the match a little bit ?
you were ?
how do you know you 're nervous ? what is evidence of that ?
after you won the first set and were ahead in the second , did the nerves come back or did you find yourself able to not think about what you might be about to do ?
first time backtoback wins on wta , two good players . have you felt an advance in your game over the last month or so ?
what is that plan ?
is that hard to do or you natural inclination ?
to go forward ?
you played a lot of quallies to get into the main draws . is there a blessing and a curse to having to go that route ?
you do n't find you get tired at this stage ?
you like having matches under your belt ?
looking back on the matches that you played , would you say there are many matches where you played better than this today , or is this the best you 've played ?
do you have any specific rankings goals or anything this year ?
at what point did you not want to throw up on court ?
easier said than done . so when you start striking the ball , do the nerves naturally go ...
very much a hard game with obviously movement and retrieving defense , and she said that she did n't feel you know , she could n't move today for some reason . did you sense that maybe she was n't at the top of her game ?
she says you did that very well . you took advantage of all your opportunities and everything .
did you feel like you like played above your level today ? were you in the zone or you played within yourself today ?
if you were to describe your game to somebody who has n't seen you before in a sentence or two , how would you describe your tennis ? not just today , but in general .
not a lot of people do that . do you feel like you play patiently enough ?
how many times has sweet home alabama played after you won ?
i know you 're good friends with melanie oudin . right now you 're moving different directions . have you talked to her at all about what she 's struggling with or anything you can do to help her ?
are you still based in alabama or are you mostly in boca ?
how much time do you actually spend in alabama ?
in atlanta ?
do you hit with robert ever ?
did he ever offer to take you mountain biking ?
alabama is not known as a tennis hotbed . where did you get the inspiration to play and actually , you know , push your game up to a level where you can actually become a pro ?
but it 's still not easy to get from playing pretty well to playing top juniors and the pro . how did you manage to make that jump to becoming a good junior and moving on ?
so you watched on tv . who inspired you ?
any women ?
are you a war eagle or roll tide ?
never beento any college football game or any football game period ?
mona , did you have some nerves at the end ? was it trying to serve out the match twice ? was that a new experience and one that 's hard to get through a little bit ?
you 've played her three times now this year . this was a much , much closer match than the last one you played her . were you able to make this one much more competitive and really give yourself a chance to pull off this big one ?
when you were down in that second set 51 , what kind of things were you doing to try to get the match turned around ?
did you discover anything against victoria that was working that maybe did n't previously work ?
which part of your game were you most pleased with today ?
you have a pretty big rise the last nine months or so . what was going on before that ?
how do you explain that so many girls from germany are playing so well now ?
it looks like it 's something else other than coincidence . all you german women are big women , good players . you almost think that germany has acted to encourage big girls to be good tennis players .
no one has beaten azarenka this year , but you 've come closer than anybody pretty much . if you had to give the rest of the field in this tournament or anyone advice on how you beat azarenka , what would you say is the key ?
a long time at the net at the end of the match . what did she tell you ?
what are the goals you want to achieve this year ?
when you talk about school , did you finish college or is it the same ...
do you remember this point : you were leading 54 in the third set and you were serving with a 3015 lead . on the next point , you had what looked like an excellent serve and they called a let on it . without that let you likely would have had a 4015 lead and two match points . do you remember that point ?
on those long rallies you seemed to really raise your game on the big points when the big points came up . is that just part of the evolution of your game this year ?
at the end of the second set , was it your mother who came and sat beside you ?
what did she tell you ?
all about survival , huh ?
what happened to the serve , especially in the game with the three doubles ? can you even figure out what happened in that game ?
is this the most difficult match you won this year ?
you have played her a couple times this year and your level maybe was n't at its best , but do you feel like she 's improved or improving or ...
you were up 51 and then i think two points away in the second set .
she did something differently or you did differently ?
were you mad at yourself for having to play a third set after the second set got away ?
is it fair to say maybe even at this time last year that 's not a match you would have been able to pull out ?
you probably have been asked this a billion times , but ...
could you just recount the moment when you encountered your grandmother and going through great struggles and she gave you advice and told you to get with it . could you talk about that , please ?
and what did she say to you ?
for somebody who used to have a temper , you , and would get frustrated , in the third set today can you actually enjoy the battle or do you find yourself still getting frustrated ?
being no.1 , do you feel like a greater responsibility to win these matches because you 're no.1 ? you do n't want to be the no.1 ranked player who lost her first match here ? does that make a difference ?
your next match . you 're playing svetlana .
irina falconi was talking to us here yesterday , and she said azarenka is the only one who is winning a lot of matches . she seemed to set you apart from all the other women . do you feel that 's an accurate summation of where you are at the moment ?
can you remember being on the other side of the equation , like a young player against a top player and serving for the match , can you remember what that kind of felt like ?
obviously a match like today is not only physically but mentally taxing . after going through something like that , do you feel like you are mentally stronger now ?
you 're obviously known for your intensity on court , and yet at the final of the australian open when you finally won , there was this incredible moment when you seemed to be saying , oh , my god , and there was this photo of you i do n't know if you can see it one of the great photos in tennis recently . could you just reflect on that moment when you finally won ?
do you think you 'll remember that moment for the rest of your life ?
can you talk about the doubles partnership with petra and how it came about ?
was there any strategy ?
can you make comments on your performance today ? compared with your performance with li na yesterday , it seems that li na has similar mistakes as you did today . is that correct ?
some spectators believe that you have more unforced errors than the previous matches . what might be the reasons for that ? the second question is how are you going to make comments on your overall performance in china open this year ?
one thing i noticed tonight was that she had these wrist bands that were the exact same color , same bright , you know , neon color as a tennis ball . did that cross your mind at all , and if so , did it bother you ?
so looking ahead , how are you going to prepare for the championships ?
you looked really tired today . your physical condition actually looks like you 're not as good as yesterday . is it because of the tough game with li na yesterday ?
i 'm just wondering , i know it 's kind of a fact of this kind of lifestyle , but obviously there is some political unrest going on between turkey and syria . do you ever think of those things when you go to places like that , or do you just put it out of your mind and say , hopefully everything is going to be okay ?
in the beginning of this season you lost in melbourne , the final . did you try to make a difference in preparation before today 's game and why it did n't work ?
if you can list one particular moment as your best memory in china open this year , what will it be ?
we know that sugarpova will be in australia next year , so when can we buy sugarpova in china ?
after the competition , will you stay more in beijing ? if you will , where will you go , great wall or other place of interest ?
going back to the match tonight , you mentioned you had a lot of errors . what is it about azarenka 's return and her serve that makes it difficult for you to finish those rallies ?
when would you launch sugarpova in the middle east ? maybe in dubai .
what do you think would be the single largest reason for you to win the match today ?
first of all , congratulations for your title . can you make a summary of your journey in china open ? you have already played five matches . which one impressed you the most , today 's match or the other matches ?
you have achieved a lot this year . what would you like to achieve in the final few weeks of the season ?
after this win , we know that you have made two histories . one is that you are the one who can win two premier mandatory titles in one season in recent years , and the other one is you are a totally new champion of china open . so what do you think of this historic moment ?
so tonight after you won , you mentioned the fans , and there have been a lot of fans who have had the same posters at every match and have been watching you practice . can you reflect on that interaction while you 're been in beijing ?
i 'm just wondering , obviously i 'm sure you 're aware there is a little bit of a scuffle going on between turkey and syria . do you have any concerns at all for going over to istanbul , or do you feel like they 'll make sure it 's safe ?
i 'm just wondering , i know it 's still the rest of the year , but have you started to give any thought about what it might feel like to go into a grand slam as a defending champion ?
going back to the match tonight , maria was making a lot of errors and you really were n't . how do you keep your mental edge when she kind of started to turn things around in the first set and started to win some games ? how do you make sure that you shut that door and not let her come back ?
maria made some comments , i guess it was last week , coming out in favor of the wta ban on grunting . where do you stand on that issue ?
after four wins against maria , hard court this year , do you feel like upper hand to play her right now ?
you 've mentioned that you 're excited for vacation towards the end of the year . do you have any plans ?
are you going to take an instagram picture of the trophy for facebook ?
do you think whoever win istanbul later this month between you and serena will decide who is the better player this season ?
first of all , congratulations for your victory . this is first time for you to enter final of china open . can you share with us , how did you make adjustment in second set ? because first set you did not take lead but after which you start to take the lead and eventually win .
first of all , congratulations for entering the final . so who do you expect to be your final opponent ?
my question is not related to the tournament . we all believe that you are a pretty girl no matter on the court or off the court . you are representative of fashion . you carry this bag to the court and to this press conference . can you tell me what might be the secret inside your bag ?
can you tell me what kind of strategy does your coach give to you ? when thomas started to coach you , i think your performance is very much good . what kind of help does thomas bring to you ? did thomas give you specific guidance about playing against li na because he knows her game really well ?
two years ago you have very much suffered from injury . did you recover to what you were preinjury ?
did you make any subtle changes to your serve following those runs of double faults early on in the first set ?
four of your eleven previous meetings were on hard courts , and your won all four of them and never lost one set . you did it again today . so do you think you have a thing to work it out every time facing li na on hard court ?
you have drawn a lot of big crowds to your matches all throughout the tournament , and they 've mainly been cheering for you . today the crowd was decidedly against you and for li na . do you think you felt that in the first set ? do you think you were feeling jitters early and that 's why you were n't performing quite as well as you were later in the match where you got more used to it ?
it seems you can always turn tough matches around . we all remember what happened in rome and same today . my question is where does a player get that mental toughness ? you are you born with it or it 's trainable or you get it from your growingup experience ?
can you make comments on your performance of this match ? there is a big difference between set 1 and set 2. what might be the reasons for that ?
in the very beginning i watched the match , but i am influenced by the spectators . are you influenced by the spectators , as well ?
i feel that actually in the first set your balls are very much even in terms of the performance . at your last service game , something goes wrong . can you talk about your last service game ? recently you have been making an adjustment to your service gesture or motion . does that influence your service in that game ?
can you tell me what might have been the arrangement for your coach before you participate into the match . what 's your relationship with your excoach , thomas ? can you make a comparison in terms of coaching staff between thomas and carlos ?
after the match today , you 're ready to prepare for wta final . what kind of a plan do you have in this regard ?
when you prepare for wta final , i 'm not sure whether wta has already given you the options for you to choose your dress .
yes .
since we are talking about the dressing style of the wta final , you have already participated in wta final twice before . so which dress in the past do you think suits you , suits your personality pretty well ?
so this season is really long . in that case , you do n't have much time to have a break . so what kind of a plan do you have for next season ?
you 're turning 31 soon . andy roddick just retired , and he 's 30 , 31. do you have any plans to maybe retire or are you going to keep going strong ?
no , i 'm just asking .
getting to the semifinal is a huge achievement , but do you think the chinese media will be critical of you because you failed to give them a home winner ?
i want to ask , you are almost to be eligible for the wta final , but eventually li na is eligible to participate in wta finals . can you make comments on this , on li na 's performance ?
in miami this year , you handed azarenka her first loss . what kind of adjustment do you think azarenka has made to win this victory today ?
you have already entered the quarterfinal in china open . are you satisfied with your performance in china open for the past two years ?
i think in the second set you did n't hold any service game , and especially when you were 400 , 4015 , you do n't have break from azarenka . what happened ?
can you talk about , is it possible for you to play fed cup tomorrow for france ?
i 'm so sorry . next year , i 'm so sorry . is it possible for you to play fed cup next year for france ? because amlie was appointed as the new captain . is there any new talk between you and the french tennis federation ?
are you thinking about this ?
there are a few points you got tonight that were on calls that were overturned . did you feel like there was a problem tonight with having to challenge calls ?
i understand that you 're also a painter . have you had any chances in beijing to do any painting ?
it looks like you 're going to play your next tournament at moscow . so are you still going to try to make more points so you can be ahead of sam stosur on the alternate position for the championships so in case someone pulls out of the championships you can get in in the last minute ?
i have heard that you are a big fan of 007. so skyfall , are you planning to watch it ?
you 're not positive with a lot of errors . are you going to try to improve your performance later on ? second question , in wta there were some female players who have achieved the no.1 spot on both singles and doubles . will this be the goal for you in the next season ?
regarding doubles , are you going to strive for no.1 ?
actually in china open this year you have a very good performance . in the past , you withdraw from the match quite a lot , but in this year , you did n't withdraw and you have a very good performance . what kind of change did you have physically and mentally ?
i want to ask that in us open you played versus sharapova , which is very much excellent . this final , you 're supposed to play against her again . what 's your comment on the final ? the second question is : no players have already got two titles of the crown events since 2009. do you think you have the potential to break this record ?
ever since 2009 no player has ever got two titles or above in the crownlevel tournament . so the potential ...
so this year was very , very lucky for you . so you have the grand slam and win the olympics in mixed doubles , and now you 're making so good here in china open . what will be your motivation for the next year ? what do you want to achieve next year , next season on court and maybe out of court ?
it 's kind of an awkward period for the whole tennis season right now , because we have four grand slams finished but the season keeps going . so i 'm wondering how you players manage to keep the momentum going in this period . you said you 're looking forward to vacation .
marion said earlier that she considers your serve return is one of the best on tour . actually , she says you are the best on tour . do you consider it 's your biggest weapon on court ?
so during the us open you were pretty tight with redfoo from lmfao . what was your response to them breaking up ?
the band broke up .
in the previous two big stages matches between you and maria this season , the australian open and also the us open , you won twice . so what would you attribute to those victories ? how much help did you gain from those previous victories to help you get ready for the final here ?
congratulations . next match you might fight against either li na or radwanska . what 's your comments on the next opponent ? and also , today kerber was injured . you also suffer from injury before . so as a player , how are you going to try to avoid injury either on the court or off the court ? what are you supposed to do to avoid injury ?
so you did n't really have any sense during the match that something might be a little bit off with her ? i mean , i know that she beat you earlier this year in paris , and i think she played you pretty close last time , as well . for you to come out and dominate this time ...
is there anything that you noticed in particular that was different playing against her today than maybe like in paris when she got you ?
can you tell us a little about your candy line , sugarpova ? are you carrying any bags of candy with you ?
all this talk about prize money and stuff like that , i 'm just wondering , from a personal point of view , do you feel like players are really underpaid ? i mean , they seem like `` poor little me , '' like they make a lot of money .
yeah .
we know that next round you have a big possibility to meet li na . could you just talk about li na , maybe what is your advantage and her advantage , especially when this tournament was held in china ?
are there times as a tennis player where the scoreline can kind of dictate your decision of whether to stay in a match or retire from a match if you kind of have a nagging injury ?
you have already beat radwanska for three matches , so in that case , it 's very much easy for you to win opponent like radwanska ?
so your last press conference , when the match ended , it 's about 11:30. physical fitness is really important . what kind of preparation did you have for this match ?
wta has confirmed that you are eligible to play for wta finals .
so through a victory today you have already be very much qualified to wta . you took control of this match . you do n't have to wait for others to fail so you can qualify . are you pleased ? last year you were not in good form at yearend championships , so this year since you are more in form , are you really looking forward for wta final this year ?
you have already doublechecked with us whether you 're qualified to play the wta final . it seems that you 're very much looking forward to that . when looking back on the experience of participating in wta final for many years , did you feel that you are getting more and more comfortable to play wta final because for a player like your level which became higher , you have a different feeling to play in the wta final ?
after the termination of china open , what kind of preparation do you have for wta final ? are you going to try to train here in china or will you travel to germany to have physical fitness and play in germany before going to istanbul ?
li na , i want to ask , do you have already confirmed your schedule or plan to participate in the tournament before australian open ?
compared with your double fault statistics , you have improved in terms of double faults . did you make any changes ?
for players that are very much into participating in the tournament organized in your home , you have already win four matches in a row , and all your opponent are very much competent . you show your best side of yourself .
i will say that in the first several rounds in china open you have a very relaxed performance and the singlelargest opponent of williams did n't participate in china open . now do you have much more confidence to win the title in china open ?
so looking ahead , you have n't played a seeded player yet . how do you keep your focus in the tournament when it has n't been as much of a test ?
bartoli or navarro .
is it hard at this time of the year to kind of still stay focused on tennis ? all the grand slams are done and stuff . you do n't think about the end line and vacation ?
can you talk more about bartoli who might be your next opponent in the semis ? i think you guys have a little bit history with each other because she beat you in istanbul last year and again in miami this year , which is your first loss of this season . are you ready to have your revenge , something like that , this time ?
also , it is reported that the women 's players council will have a meeting in istanbul later this month to discuss about the prize money increase for next year grand slams . do you know actually about this ?
if it turns out to be marion , how difficult is she to play ? besides her game is unorthodox , she does all those shadow strokes and jumping around in between points . is it hard to like not see that and just to do your own thing ?
going back to the match today , i saw at the end of the game you applauded oprandi at the net . what do you think of her game today ? she kind of gave you a little bit of a challenge late in the first set .
as the world no.1 , do you have a general idea about what needs to be done with the prize money stuff and what things you would like to see with the changes for next year ?
last question should be a fun question for you .
so you 're having a good week here in beijing . are you making any progress on your chinese ?
got it . thank you .
can you translate the word ?
you have played three matches in three days . you have yet to lose a set . is everything going to plan ? are you happy with your performance here so far ?
do you feel tired at all , having played three matches in three days ?
in the last few years you suffered several injuries . this year you seem pretty well . do you have some new plan for your recovery ?
can you talk about the fun side of combined events ? do you actually watch some men 's matches , or do you have lunch together in players ' restaurant , or do you socialize a little bit in the players ' lounge ?
just like this one , you had three very easy wins to push you into round 4 of this year 's tournament . what 's the key to your wellrounded performance ?
in the past few days you have answered a few questions about sugarpova . my question is : among all the business opportunities you had , why you choose candy to start your own business ?
have you ever been to russian district in beijing ? if you have been there , what 's your opinion about it ?
starting from the third set , i noticed that you cover your face with towel . do you cry ? or problem with injury has already influenced your performance here today ?
i think for today 's match , chinese audiences will be very much excited and happy . just now even li na said you both try your best and are very much familiar with each other , which make the match much more fierce and tough . do you think , too ?
today we noticed that you have large range of footwork , and also the strategy you have already introduced start to work efficiently , as well . so that is to say you have very good service return , and then you 're going to work out a different strategy to fight against li na ; is that right ?
i would like to talk something which is more relaxed . i personally believe that you deserved the title here today . unfortunately you lose the match . yeah , we really believe it 's a regret for you . psychologically i 'm on your side . i support you . that 's a really , really excellent match today . the question i want to ask is : although the match is really excellent today , the atmosphere is destroyed by the audiences because a lot of people say , come on li na , come on , peng shuai . this will never ever happen in the other countries , so what kind of suggestion do you have to the chinese audiences on the court when they 're watching the performance so in that case our media will have the coverage in this regard to educate audiences .
after the match what does alan say to you to comfort you ?
this is the ninth year for china open . in the past nine years you have already participated in all china open . you started to be professional player from 2004. every year you have a very good performance in china open . can you make comments on your relationship to china open ?
i always feel that you are a very shy girl no matter win or lose . when you answer the questions from journalists you are very much calm , but i tell easily you started to cry just now . why is that ?
i was wondering if you and li na had spoken in either the days leading up to the match or after the match and what you guys might have said to each other .
just to each other , about the match or anything .
i want to know next time when you match chinese player again , will you be tough or you will be milder like this one ?
first , congratulations . actually , today it 's a really tough match , especially for your service . you have a lot of double faults . also , you also have a large quantity of unforced errors . my question is : can you tell me whether you feel a little bit impatient or rushed during the match ?
i think the audiences today are very much excited and happy , because they can feel that for the two highly competent female players in china who are very much , you know , concentrate on the match . so do you think when will china see the next generation , i mean , the junior generation come up and then to play the match as you are ? for example , zhang shuai is yet to decide when to play as an individual player . did you take a long time to consider whether you 're going to take the professional career as an individual player ?
it seems like you work out that decision easily and very much fast .
i think this is very important tough competition in professional career because you have a competition with another chinese player . some people say that if you can make through this match , you are gon na have next milestone in your professional career . actually today we noticed carlos did n't go to the court to talk to you during the match . will you bother to give us explanation why ? even you have very tough competition , you did n't ask carlos to go to the court to discuss with you .
if bartoli fail to be champion in china open , definitely you will be qualifying to play for wta final . so can you share with us your expectation for your preparation for wta final ?
every time when we talk about the young or junior players you are not very much confidant for them . today ze zhang is competing with gasquet . will you bother to make comments on the significance of this match ? because in china it 's not easy first to have excellent , you know , chinese male player as you are in top 10 .
before you participate in this match , does your coach give you specific guidance to be prepared for peng shuai , or does peng shuai give you some unexpected things during the match ?
my question is following the previous question . zhang shuai wanted to take the professional player and play as individual player . i want to ask you that . you know , everybody knows zhang shuai 's personality . for the other players like zhang shuai , if they 're going to try to play as individual player , do you think how much opportunity will be given , what kind of practice will be given to zhang shuai ?
today we know that peng shuai has a strong will and she is patient . we noticed from the statistics you have over 20 winners . does that mean that you want to be more aggressive and try to finish the match as soon as possible ? for the crownlevel match , we have two chinese female players . does that mean that actually this will help us to improve the brand for chinese players ?
( off microphone . )
some people say that when you are trying to do some homework prior to the competition it 's very much easy for you to lose because you ca n't get enough information from the opponent . is that simply because you do n't know the opponent before ? does your coach carlos help you to change you in this regard ? you will stick to what you planned in advance even if you are not so familiar with your opponent ?
tomorrow you 're going to fight against radwanska . in north america this year you have already defeated her twice . so can you talk about it ?
are you going to make any changes with how you approach service tomorrow ?
did you and peng shuai exchange any words after the match ?
in the first set it 's very much easy to win , but in the second set you lose it . did you ever try to think what had happened ? the next question is : what 's your preparation and expectation for the next match against sharapova ?
the wta announced today that you and other two players have been qualified to participate into the final . what kind of a preparation do you have to do before you can participate into the final ? what tournament are you supposed to participate after china open ?
recently the performance of the german players are very much good . can you make comments on the characteristics of you and your partners ?
we know that you are one of the female players who have the highest percentage of wins in matches . this is a very good achievement . last year you are top 4 in the us open , so what kind of preparation , what 's your plan for next season ?
that was the first time that you and caroline have gone to three sets . it was a longer match . what 's your plan for recovery now ?
i think you have risen from 32nd place in the rankings in the end of last year to i think 6 at the moment . what are the reasons for that ? why this year have you made a breakthrough ?
there are a couple of times during the match that your coach came out to talk to you . you were able to pull out the win in the end . what did your coach say to you ?
can you talk about vesnina 's game a little bit today .
so were there any parts of your game today that you feel you can improve for next time ?
no , for your next match .
after the match you looked pretty relieved . during the match you were getting frustrated . can you kind of express in words your emotions after the match ?
i could n't tell , but at the very end of the match , by your bench you threw something into the stands . what was that ?
right after the match , you went to your bench and you threw a couple of things into the stands .
just towels ?
can you talk about your next match in the quarters , please ?
( in chinese . ) prior to the press conference , we are told that we can only ask a question which is related to the tournament . can you tell me what had happened behind ?
prior to this press conference , all the reporters said that they can only ask the question which is related to the match . they 're not allowed to ask any question which is not relevant to the tournament . can you tell us what 's happening behind ?
actually , before the press conference , all the reporters are told that actually we can only ask a question related to the tournament .
can you comment on your performance today ? do you think what might have been the most important reason ? is that because you 're not prepared for this match ? because i have noticed you have too many unforced errors .
after china open , do you have any plan for the other tournament ? i know that you 're going to participate into the federation cup final . what kind of expectation do you have for that tournament ?
it kind of seemed like oprandi was n't really trying to win a lot of winners or hitting the ball that hard , just trying to extend rallies and waiting for you to make a mistake . did you feel that way , as well ?
she also kind of was going with the dropshot a lot . is that something that maybe surprised you or caught you offguard ?
how do you feel you served ? she broke you a few times , but it was n't like you were doublefaulting all that much .
can you make comments on your performance and especially the opponent , ms.radwanska ? it seems like you do n't get used to her way of playing tennis ; is that right ?
radwanska is as young as you are . you 're both at the same age . radwanska is no.3 in the world now in terms of ranking . so what can you learn from this match ? the second question : actually in the eighth game of the second set you have some opportunity . unfortunately you do n't seize the opportunity . do you think that if you can seize that opportunity the result might be different ?
actually , for young players , we do n't have the ones who are playing by themselves , i mean , that are becoming professional players to fight by themselves , so what is the potential worry ?
actually , you have a very good performance second set , which must have tremendously improved your confidence . if you have a chance to break to fight against an opponent like radwanska , will that improve your confidence in the future ? i also noticed that sometimes you lose some points to your opponent . it means it is because you do n't have enough practice in the court ? how are you going to address those issues ?
can you make comments on your opponent ?
you are defending champion , and last year when you win the title , you dance on the court . yesterday when we interviewed djokovic , he said he 's not minding dancing together with you . i 'm not sure whether you have the similar ideas as what he did .
the result of a tennis game can be changeable , and especially today it 's a tough game . everybody was cheering for zhang shuai . how do you make justifications in your game ?
you are the defending champion here . i assume you spend a lot of quality time in players ' area last year . the tournament upgrade the players ' lounge and the player restaurant this year . have you noticed difference ? can you have some comments on that ?
could you talk a little bit about your strategy going into the match that you just played ?
the eighth game of the second set , do you think that game is the key point that make you to win this match ? because this game last about 16 minutes . so how did you break her serve finally ? the second question : do you think that the opponent is potential player and also have some talent if she want to , like you , big achievement , what should she do to improve herself ?
you just mentioned the court here is pretty slow . do you think that if you have advantage over other players because your game use the court here pretty well ? you won last year .
actually , lisicki is a very tough opponent . based on your performance today , it 's very much easy to beat her . so can you share your thoughts on your performance here today ?
i know the opponent is very much it 's end of the season . compared with what she performed before , what 's the big difference before between her and the other opponents ?
( off microphone . )
you entered ...
it 's very much possible for wta to control the screaming made by the opponents on the court . there was an interview of sharapova by reuters , to see if she was going to agree to this control . what 's your opinion on this regulation posed by wta ?
you got the gold medal with olympics doubles . how did you keep that ? did you carry the gold medal with you or probably keep it at home ?
any thoughts on the press money for the australian open next year ?
novak said earlier that they 're not satisfied with the results , wanting more reactions from other three grand slams . so is there anything similar ongoing in the women 's tour right now , you know , they want more money as well as men 's tour ?
in the first set , especially in the first four games , you have very good performance but after which your performance failed . what might have been the reason ?
actually , we see your opponent in this game through the qualifying matches . how did you prepare the match in advance ? also , to decide to participate into the wta finals in sofia , what 's your arrangement next ?
how did you make evaluation to your rise in performance in this season ? if you happen to penetrate to top 20 or 25 , how are you going to try to make one more step forward ?
after first set , what did your coach tell to you ? li na take look at notes . do you have similar habit ?
did you feel in wta we have a lot of junior or young players that are rising ? in past , people are very much impressed by your strong will . will that be still very important power for you to move forward ?
i have two questions . the first one is in this year , are you going to participate in the sofia tournament ? second , for nextround opponent , how are you going to try to prepare for next round and what 's your evaluation for her ?
for the second set , you waste away a game point . how did you try to make a justification and come back ?
two weeks ago you got champion title in korea . does that boost your confidence ?
did you watch much of the ryder cup , and how proud are you of rory ?
was it late because you were texting or tweeting each other ?
do you have much contact with each other while you 're playing in these big events ?
throughout your entire match tonight it seemed like it was really tight between you and your opponent , but in the last set you kind of pulled away . what changed in the last set to give you that advantage ?
recently you came out with a new underwear line . why did you choose to go with underwear and not something else ?
i think it 's fair to say you slipped down in the rankings a bit recently . you seem to be enjoying some form in asia . is there something you particularly like about playing out here ?
how do you plan on carrying your success in asia through to next year ?
after a long match tonight , what 's your plan for recovery before going into the next match ?
based on your current ranking , it should be very much easy for you to defeat a opponent , but the whole procedure is not that relaxed as we expected . how are you going to make an adjustment into your fitness ?
actually for the two sets today you eventually made the win possible . the second question is : actually the audience and the court are going to cheer for you . would you bother to make an evaluation to those fans ?
actually , for one game you should have the break point . at that point audience said , maria , i love you , so would that influence you at that moment ?
after you got french open title , you got the grand slam , so i want to understand what might be your next goal .
i think in the wta ranking , actually a lot of young juniors is catching up . do you feel a lot of pressure from those junior players ? how are you going to still keep very good fitness faced with those pressures ?
there was a point in the first set where you dropped a few games and you called your coach over . after that you were able to come back and win the first set . what did your coach say to you , and how did you get the mental toughness to overcome that and win the set ?
for your opponent today , you did n't beat her for three times before , so what might have been the reasons for you to defeat her today ? for the second set , in the very beginning , you took a big lead , and unfortunately she tried to catch up but finally you made it and then win the game . what might have been the reason ?
i have two questions . after the match i know that you drew a heart when you give signature . i do n't know what that 's for . the second : we notice two statistics today . the first you have eight break point chances , but just only master four . and then the opponent have nine break point chances but she masters four . so that 's a very important indication that you have a very stable performance and you have a very good performance in handling the critical ball .
you have already participated into china open and guangzhou open . i know that you are going to go to europe to participate in the itf . i want to doublecheck whether it is the real schedule you are going to have . another part of my question is some players are very much influenced by injuries . so i really want to understand , how is your fitness right now ? this is the thing that we care most from the perspective of fans .
we know that in last season you have a very good performance . in this season , you were injured and also change the racquet . do you think this year it 's a special year for you ? you have a lot of test from god ? how do you say that ?
just now you mentioned that it 's more important to focus on the physical fitness . did you ever try to discuss with allen that for example in terms of the recovery and the physical fitness training , you will inject more energy to make yourself stronger than ever before ?
come back to this match . in the first or second set , at every match point or set point , in the first set it 's easy to guard the set point , but in the second set it 's not easy for you to keep the , you know , set point . but anyway , you win . do you have any specific plan to celebrate ?
( off microphone . )
talk a little about the dynamic about playing against your doubles partner in singles . is there incentive to win ? she obviously seemed pretty frustrated .
what are your impressions of the match ?
what are your thoughts on your secondround matchup ?
i think your performance here today is much better than what you had in tokyo tournament . in which area did you make some changes ?
it 's very much cold in the night of beijing . do you think that will influence your performance ?
do you think what will be the single largest potential opponent for you to find before you 're gon na reach the title ?
did that match go exactly how you would have wanted it to ?
did the match go exactly how you would have hoped ?
yeah . you won in straight sets , 62 , 63. is that the best start ?
before when you participated in the china open , you withdraw . china is not a lucky place for you ?
is it your first time to play in this stadium ? how do you like this court ? what might be the difference between this one and the other court you have played before ?
last year you withdraw because of injury . do you have big ambitious goal this year ? who do you think will be the big opponent , and how are you going to prepare for the match ?
was that the perfect start for you today ?
is there anything in particular you can attribute that to , just having served so well today ?
i just noticed that you have very good memories here in china open . would you share us something you particularly missed here in beijing or you particularly like to do in beijing ?
this is your second time playing against mchale now . i guess talk about her and as an upandcoming player .
what 's your target in china open ? are you satisfied with your performance in this season ?
you mentioned it would be nice to get back to top 10 and qualify for the championships . you had chances in french open and us open but all failed . when you look back , do you think get back to top 10 is too far away or you just work on that ?
you could match up against lepchenko in the next round . from what i can tell , you guys have n't played head to head before on tour . what are your expectations for that potential matchup ?
petra kvitova said there will be 14,000 people obsessed in prague when you play fed cup with czech republic . have you set a goal already in your mind with a huge fight already ?
how does if feel to be the champion ?
what made the difference between you tonight ? why did you win and she did n't ?
is it difficult to play someone who is hitting so many errors in between really good points ?
you finished last season well , but why this several moths of great success ?
what do you like about coming to dubai , apart from winning the tournament ?
you are already the no.5 in the rankings , your best position . do you feel you can reach the top one very soon ?
how encouraging is that there is no fixed no.1 , there are a lot changes in the top position ?
you always seem very calm on the court . what was going through your head when she was staging the fightbacks in the middle of both sets ?
what parts of your game do you think you can improve on for the rest of the season ?
your play style is pretty unique . does that give you some extra satisfaction and pride ? i may not hit ball as hard as you but i have skills and i can defeat you . do you feel that way ?
obviously there was a big field here , high class , high quality . i know obviously victoria and petra had to withdraw . does it give you confidence that there was such a strong field and you 've come out on top going forward ? that must give you confidence .
you did n't get a bye either .
obviously this year is an olympic year . are you targeting that as well ?
where did you come up short tonight ?
what do you do wrong tonight ?
so disappointing tonight , but you 've had a great week .
your reaction ? obviously one of disappointment being the defending champion here , i would imagine .
your reflections on the tournament overall ? how do you feel you played here ?
i believe julia 's beaten you three times in a row now , although you had beaten her twice before . what is it about julia 's game that you have difficulty with perhaps at the moment ?
you 're obviously playing quite a bit below your best at the moment . do you have any thoughts as to why that might be ?
is it a worry for you , your form at the moment ?
obviously the last time you played was on clay so it 's different . can you kind of compare how she 's playing to a year ago ? is she playing better ?
what will you do between now and indian wells ?
do you look forward to that part of the season , indian wellsmiami ?
you won indian wells , did n't you , last year ? you do n't feel any extra pressure there ?
is there anything you could have done differently tonight ?
how did you get through that third set sprinting through it ?
is this the best first two months of the season of your career ? if so , why did it happen this year ?
does it seem a long time ago that you won those two asian events ?
with the way last season finished when you won in beijing and tokyo , was n't it ?
did you feel you sort of did n't want 2011 to end ?
what changed for you in the middle of last year ?
so is your father not coming to any tournaments now ?
do you think that because azarenka is not here , i mean , does this make the tournament easy , more easy and give you more confidence ? not you , i mean most of the players , that there is hope to get the title .
how does it feel to be in the final ?
was your fitness perhaps a factor in today 's match and generally in the matches you play , inasmuch as jelena seemed to be a bit surprised that you tracked down some of the balls she hit at you ? she seemed a bit taken aback at times .
just back on your coaching situation , a lot of women are coached by their fathers . your father coached you all the way through . was that a difficult decision for him to make not to carry on traveling with you ?
is he traveling with your sister ?
have they made any particular changes to your game ?
looking ahead to the final , you either play caro or julia . they have contrasting styles . how would you adjust your game ?
do you think that being independent of your father now has made you more confident , you 've had to play with more aggression on court and be more independent ?
has it changed your mindset at all ?
tennis players compete for prize money and ranking points ever day . talk about how hard is it to make close friends with other players . is true friendship possible to exist in women 's tennis ?
considering what you just said , since you and caroline are very good friends , is there no small part of you that you prefer to play her opponent instead of her ?
must be a great feeling to make the final your first year here .
must be in the back of your head that you beat her the last two times . did that give you any extra confidence ?
thoughts on the final ?
what did you learn from australia about her ?
are there any things that you were not very pleased with today that you would like to change for tomorrow ?
when you say you 've changed a lot since the fed cup , do you mean in your mental approach , in your confidence ?
how have you changed that ?
like you , radwanska has been in a good way recently . what aspect of her game will pose the greatest threat in the final ?
is it significant that this is your first victory over caroline on a hard court ? previously you beat her on clay twice .
what is it about your game specifically that you reckon caroline does n't like ? if you sensed that on the court , there must be something you think she does n't like .
when you come here and you saw the draw and with how you felt about your game , did you ever imagine you would play the final ?
tell us how you feel about that match .
what is it about her game that 's obviously very difficult to play against ?
do you feel as under the weather as you sound ?
how much does the traveling catch up with you ? looking at your last month or so , australia , back to switzerland , back here .
does that catch up with you in the end ?
how do you cope generally with a change in time zones ?
we were talking to jankovic yesterday about the fed cup . for years there 's been an idea that in davis cup it should be truncated into a twoweek window maybe in october or something like that .
and then just play with world group nations in one event and play it as a knockout there .
that would be a bit more sensible for fed cup , especially that the women have got a little bit more time to play , right ?
you probably have it tougher than anyone , do n't you , because there 's three weeks where tennis is in your part of the world , and then off it goes miles away again .
can i talk to you on another matter and refer to you as one of more experienced members of the tour ?
now , i was talking to one of the leading players coaches the other day , and he said being a women 's coach is so much different than being a men 's coach , in that you 're much more a psychological coach as well . with the oncourt coaching , is too much importance put on the role of the coach in the women 's game ?
because david is really lowkey and has not sought the spotlight at all .
do you call david onto court much ?
why ?
one player said the other day she was just about to serve for the match and her coach agitated and wanted to come on to see her . and he did . he came on . i mean , you could never envisage such a situation for yourself ?
but when you 're playing fed cup it 's the same guy sitting next to you .
do you just get on with what you 're doing , or does he have much to say to you ? does he have an input then ?
what 's your sort of scenario now , to try and stay in good shape over the american swing and then to build for the grand slam , or do you think of america as an important goal in itself ?
looking at the past few years at the french , you 've got to be one of the major contenders . is that the way you 're looking at it ?
that was very efficient of you , was n't it ?
what did you think you did particularly well today ?
where does her serve figure ? obviously serena has got the really big shot . is she close to it ?
looking forward to tomorrow 's match ?
women 's tennis is getting more and more physical . you 're not the strongest girl , but you are doing well . do you try to also like put some muscles on you , or do you worry about your agility and speed ?
where did you do your winter training ? back in poland ?
and the training facilities are good there ?
it 's interesting when you say you want to go back for two or three days when you told me before it 's not the easiest place to get to because your not living in warsaw and there 's not really time to relax if you 're just flying in and out .
sorry to take you back over old ground , but i was n't in doha last week . you did seem a bit annoyed at the end of last week 's semifinal . is this a good chance to atone for that ?
yeah . i was n't asking for you to criticize the other player .
you were comfortable in that match all the way through really , were n't you ? you always had the upper hand ?
do you try dictate the points yourself more than you used to ?
how happy are you with the way things are going with the new coach ?
where did you meet this guy ? where did you do your offseason stuff ?
bradenton ?
and how did you get to know this guy ?
did you know him before ?
because he has n't really worked in top tennis before .
but it was your new agent that recommended him ?
sorry . i thought you had one .
did you think at any stage you might just carry on without a coach ?
why appoint a coach at all then ?
do you think in the women 's game many players are two reliant on their coaches ? i sat behind one i wo n't say whoit was but i sat behind a very wellknown player , and every single point was looking up to the coach . things go wrong , it was sort of a ...
because both the atp and the grand slams are insistent that the men 's game will not have oncourt coaching . they say that it 's an individual sport .
which is the way tennis is supposed to be played , is n't it ?
so if you made the rules , would there be no oncourt coaching ?
is your mom traveling with you as much ?
is she here ?
yeah , i did n't see her .
is that a new idea ? because your mom always used to be ...
we feel that you are focused and you want the title this year . how do you feel it , and do you think that you can be able to win ?
radwanska or lisicki .
you 've had a strong offseason . you 've got a new coach . a lot has been talked about that . there are multiple slam winners in the tournament or has been . what do you think you need to get to be in slam contention in the majors now ?
do you feel that you 're up there nowto compete with the big guns at the moment ?
but you 've been around the game for a few years now .
you say that ; i was n't going to say that . but is it now a flatter playing field for everyone , everyone has more of a chance ? there were six different champions in the last six slams , so none the top 25 can really be counted out .
but then li na and sam stosur win their first slams when they 're more veteran than you .
do you think women 's tennis needs the same kind of rivalry as men 's tennis , or because it 's so open it makes it exciting ?
how would you cap this performance here ?
yeah .
do you see any improvements ? what sort of aspects have you improved upon ?
if you were to judge , how far are you from your best , let 's say , french open 2008 ?
jelena has a house here . would you think or have you thought about moving here maybe ?
would you think about it ?
what made the difference between you two tonight ?
were you going for too much ?
still , there was n't very much in it , was there ? one hold of serve here and another one there and it would have been a different match .
the toss on the serve , was that part of the problem ?
you were saying the other day that you still need to work on your backhand . caroline seemingly tonight made a point of keeping it away from your forehand quite a bit . she was working you on the backhand wing . is it nice have to that practice ? and also , the fact that wozniacki did n't want to go into your forehand side ?
where do you go from who are ? america presumably .
what would be a good year for you this year ? getting back into the top 10 ?
that would be your main target this year ?
talk a little bit about coaching . we 've been talking to some of the players about oncourt coaching , yes , no . sam stosur does n't want to do it ; jelena now says she does n't want to do it . you would like have to nigel come on and talk to you quite a lot , would you ?
will you go away feeling encouraged from what 's happened here , do you think ?
do you often sleep badly after losses ?
what do you do , read ?
do you want to talk to people or be on your own ?
good one to get through , was n't it ? tough match .
when you 're coming up against a player who did well last week , does it make you extra sharp going into the match , or is it like any other match ?
you got a cold ?
how long you been suffering with that then ?
quite a lot girls are not too well .
is it the fact that it 's unseasonable chilly here ?
you 've had sort of two different careers . how did things turn around for you in the singles ?
was there more focus on physical fitness after what you went through ?
jelena jankovic next . talk about that match .
going back to today 's game , obviously when an opponent wins the second set on tiebreak , perhaps the crowd is thinking , this could be quite tight and whatnot . more often than not , it seems that that player then drops down a level and the opponent just sails through , as happened today . what was that boundary ? did you step up ? did she drop off ?
vika pulled out today ; obviously petra is not here . does that open up the draw for someone like yourself ?
it was a bit tight . what do you think of the game ?
is the wind different from court 1 to center court ? what 's more difficult ?
azarenka pulled out today . she 's the only one who beats you this year . do you feel a bit confident , that like the one person who beats you this year is not in the draw anymore ?
it 's only the second month of the season , but already a lot of the big players , top players , they 're pulling out with injuries . how do you think you can explain that ? do i feel that in the second month you guys are all exhausted ?
can you talk about the next match ? it 's either lisicki or benesova . just tell me each one how your game matches up with them .
there was an article about you online calling you the quiet achiever . do you like being out of the spotlight , or do you feel that you are out of the spotlight ?
was that an easier match than you thought ? you played so well .
were the conditions a bit easier today than playing at night ?
will you talk about your next match ? sam or lucie . can you just say how your game matches up ?
vika pulled out today because of the injury she picked up in doha . the wta have really gone out of their way to make the season shorter . big gap in the offseason . still there is a real a lot of withdrawals here . is it just coincidence , or is it a tough time of the year ?
so it 's the fed cup really that 's caused a lot of problems ?
with all the big names dropping out , does that give you more confidence of going all the way here ?
the draw does open up for almost everyone . i mean , petra is gone from your side and vika is gone from the top . so pretty much although you 're all virtually at the same level , it 's anyone 's from here .
there is n't really a firm favorite .
back to fed cup for a second , in the men 's circuit some people were suggesting that davis cup would be better every two years . do you like the fact that fed cup is annual ? is this a good idea ?
another idea that is regularly put forward about davis cup and would seem to lend itself to fed cup in light what you were saying , is that they truncate the whole of fed cup into a twoweek period in one venue .
everyone about davis cup says that would make a lot more sense .
no , no .
the two parties talk together .
that was good in the end , but there were a few ups and downs .
was it a little unsettling beforehand whether you were actually going to play or not ? she pulled out of doubles and then there were wrong reports she pulled out of the singles as well .
how much of a key to your game is your serve ? it 's been a problem , has n't it , in the past sometimes ? you said the other day you think it 's improving .
nigel said in australia that part of his job was getting you to believe in yourself a bit more and getting you to see that you are more of a champion . is it a question of belief with you , would you say , at times perhaps ?
and yesterday you said that you still had confidence your game could matchup against the best . it 's likely to sound a bit presumptuous , but it 's likely you 'll face wozniacki next . you looking forward to that ?
is maria sharapova someone you could look to take a leaf out of almost ? you 've won a grand slam before maria , and yet she 's now second in the world . is she someone you could emulate to get back up there ?
no , no . you won the french in 2008 and her last was australia 2008. so you 've won before her in that regard .
you talked about confidence . have you ever worked with a sports psychologist ?
when was the last time everything was in place ?
nigel told me today in the breakfast room that you were no longer glutenfree . now , because novak and andy murray are sort of extolling the virtues of a glutenfree diet , why did you decide it was n't ?
you 're very fashion conscious . why do n't your nails match your tennis dress ?
can you talk to us about the match ? how did it go for you ?
just going back , obviously you 're a twotime pattaya open champion . this time last year i think you came in here and lost early on because your health was n't terribly good . how are you now ? you must be feeling an awful lot better .
julia goerges is your next opponent . what do you know of her game ?
you only play peng once , 2007. can you compare ? did she play different at that time ?
daniela , it was a nearperfect performance today apart from the double fault in the end . do you think that this time you can go all the way here ?
kvitova obviously pulled out , and today vika 's pulled out . does that open the draw up for a player like yourself and everyone else , would you say ?
what are your aspirations or hopes for this season ?
the conditions have been windy for the past two , three days . if it stays the same , how much do you have to adjust your normal game ?
you 've been coming here for several years . do you feel the weather is getting colder and colder ?
how did it go today ?
do you feel you 're one of those players who can play better or know you have not realized your potential as a player ?
how excited are you about fed cup ?
chances ?
you think you can do it ? you have the team ?
you had a good week last week , good wins . next match is against one of the top seeds . does it give you confidence that last week you beat someone like wozniacki ?
how can you hurt her tomorrow ? she 's a very aggressive player , a lot of power .
you 're the kind of player that on any given day it 's very difficult to say that you 're going to lose because you can beat a lot of top players . you have the game . what do you think you need to do to be more consistent and do it on a more regular basis ? do you feel you 're close to doing it ?
can you tell me , the swing in the middleeast , doha and dubai , do you enjoy coming here ? how significant is it for you , these two tournaments ?
just going back to back fed cup , obviously your opponents are italy , i believe . what do you make of the italian team ? they won backtoback fed cups .
on a hunch , what surface do you reckon you would play on ? hard ?
fair enough . just going on back on the strength ever czech tennis at the moment , petra and tomas won hopman cup not too long ago . it 's good that the national tennis is going so well at the moment , both ...
tough match .
what makes her difficult to play ?
how difficult is it to play a qualifier who obviously has played three matches in the conditions and knows what it 's all about and is match hardened ?
are you pleased with your year so far ? you 've only lost to one player , have n't you ?
how is the shoulder ? obviously it 's heavily strapped .
are there any more besides victoria azarenka that you have to be careful of ?
it was a tough first round to get , was n't it ?
when you went to serve out the match for the first time , did it make you nervous ?
you do n't see many players send for their coach just before they 're about to serve for the match . what was your thinking ?
what did he say ?
was it in the back of your mind at all that perhaps you may not have to play the next match because maria was injured today ? she has a neck injury .
what difference is it making to your tennis working with nigel ?
your forehand was one of your biggest weapons .
what are nigel 's qualities as a coach ? you 've had a number of coaches . is he different to other coaches ?
you 've been working with him now for seven or eight months . you 're still i think it 's fair to say a little bit unpredictable , a little bit up and down . how long do you think it will take you to get the consistency you need ?
since you were world no.1 there 's been another wave of the players in wozniacki , kvitova , azarenka , all maybe two , three years younger than you . do you think there is no reason why you ca n't get back to being as good as them ?
you said last year that you were rather envious of novak and his team , that he had so much fun playing tennis . a year on , do you feel as if there is more relaxation , more of that air in your own camp ?
can i ask you one question about tennis in serbia ? you 've had this fantastic generation you and jelena , and in the men , novak , janko , viktor but there are n't many 18 , 19 , 20 year olds , are there , who are pushing to get at the top ? is it difficult , do you think , for the next generation of serbian players because of the standards that you have set ?
i spoke to bojana , and she said she thinks that maybe it 's a problem that the younger players get good support from the federation now , which you did n't have , and maybe it 's better to come through like you did when you had to really fight for everything .
good week playing against azarenka last week , and now coming from the qualifiers and one big one gone .
what can you draw from this sort of experience wherein you play the big ones all the time ?
so you look at a much better future ?
you 're still in constanta ?
what was it like growing up in a portside city ?
to constanta ?
it 's a very good place . what sort of following do you have in constanta ? are you famous ? do people recognize you ?
and your father , the shop , everything is in constanta ?
what would you say was the difference today between your game and anastasia 's ? what were you doing better that she was struggling with ?
she 's renowned for being quite a heavy hitter . if you give her a flat ball to hit , she can perhaps blow her opponents away . was there a tactic to move her around or take that strength away from her a bit ?
how do you feel now in the tournament obviously having played quallies and ...
is it a good time is it evera good time but is it a better time to play caroline now , you know , having lost the no.1 ranking , having gone out early in qatar ?
your reaction to the win , flavia ? 63 , 63. how did you feel you played today ?
sure . how much was the wind a factor ?
i believe anabel was slightly higher above you in the world rankings , and you 're around 28 .
how important is it to play in a competition like this and do well in terms of moving up the rankings ?
you 're playing with francesca here in the doubles . you got a wild card .
must be nice to get that match out of the way in straight sets and not play three sets , because that 's a big toll .
targets or goals for the year ?
quite a difficult start for you , and then you kind of ran away with it , did n't you ?
it took 16 minutes to finish the first three games . were you feeling her out , the court , the conditions ?
what was the best part of your game today ?
talk about your first serve percentage .
i do n't know if someone already asked you this , but the past four years you 've come here , first round out .
what 's going to be different this time ?
you got to the third round in australia and lost to kvitova .
you retired . you then got to the final in pattaya . how do you feel about the season so far ?
you called for the trainer i believe quite early on . was there a problem there ?
when did you arrive in dubai ?
you manage to get out and about at all ?
next match will be a tough match . how do you expect it ?
ana ivanovic or schiavone .
both players are very tough players on hard .
you have a better record against ivanovic , i believe , compared to your record against schiavone . would you prefer to see ana win in a way ?
nice way to start the week .
is the secret of having a good year staying healthy and fit for you ?
safe to play with it like that ?
was it a concern that it 's quite cold at night with the injury ?
you own a place here , do n't you ?
do you stay there ?
does it help your tennis ?
is it good for training ?
because roger federer has a place here , and he prefers to stay at a hotel because if he stays at home he feels like he 's kind of semi on vacation . just wondered if you feel the same way ?
you know the city very well . do you have a few favorite spots here ? what do you enjoy doing here most ?
did it taste good ?
how aware are you of the match beforehand ? and does seeing a great player like sveta lose sort of play on your mind as you go out on the court , or do you try and block that out ?
very satisfying debut here , is n't it ?
she was playing well up to the end . how did you beat her ?
how cold was it out there ?
when you saw the draw and you had to play her and then azarenka ...
i think this is your sixth or seventh tournament this year . you played fed cup as well . are you a player who likes to keep busy , keep playing ?
it seems suddenly we have four top 20 players from germany . can you talk about that ? and you guys are pretty good friends with each other ?
why do you think there was a period in not just the women but the men as well when that there were n't many top german players . a lot men in the top 100 as well .
how do you propose going about trying to beat victoria azarenka on current form ? she 's looking pretty formidable right now .
last week in doha you played with zheng .
how did you decide to play together and how does it go so far ?
( question indiscernible ) .
talk about the match . you got off to a great start . second set she kind of climbed back in there , got you to 41 down .
earlier in the week you said you 're kind of a negative person . did you ask yourself ?
what was your strategy going in ?
what did this win mean to you , particularly since you are good friends ?
you had a different confidence going in .
why is this so much bigger than moscow ? do you feel like your game the tournament in moscow . why is this bigger ?
it seemed like she was getting very vocal out there . when she gets that energetic , did you feel like you need to kind of match her energy level ?
domi , a lot of players now have big teams . you and marion became friends i guess what in 2008 when you first started playing her ?
how did you two become friends and why is she the type of person you can be friendly with ?
when did you name your hitting partner as your coach ?
so when would you say would be official ?
do you have the same physio ?
that 's what i thought . so who is he ?
his name ?
his last name ?
so where did you meet him ?
( indiscernible ) . your coach ?
yeah , we heard . ( indiscernible ) . are you going to be able to go home before you go to london ?
bartoli was saying that in order to become a top 10 player for her the most important thing she found was consistent results . right now one great tournament and then a couple bad . do you see that ?
what worked well for you today in your match against oudin ?
what was your strategy there , go to the backhand a little bit ?
after two matches here , how would you assess where your game is right now ?
your sister 's done very well here the last two years . has she given you any advice about playing here ?
what kind of other things would you be talking about with your sister other than tennis ?
did she give you some places to go shop ?
did she give you a request of something to buy for her at the outlets ?
speaking of your sister , from what i understand i was n't there but when the umpire announced that you were serving , i believe he said your sister 's name rather than your name . did you notice ?
so you did n't give the umpire a dirty look or anything like that ?
how is your game different from your sister 's ?
you 've had a pretty good summer . is that the biggest reason why ? what 's difference this past summer ? you been playing pretty well .
must have been pretty proud of your sister making the finals as the championships .
are you more nervous when you 're playing or watching your sister in a big match ?
no ?
really ?
you understand it ?
is it a burden having a sister who is so wellknown , or is that an advantage ? what 's that like when you 're the little sister coming in ?
and it took her a little while to get to that level too where she is now . she fought for a while .
does she help you with the physical or mental part of the game more ?
now that you 've played melanie , what did you think about her game ? what impressions did you have ?
what would it mean to you to win this tournament after your sister back to back ?
if you win it , do you think they 'll get the right name on the trophy ?
hopefully ?
given any thoughts to the olympics next week ? looking forward to the opening ceremony ?
( question regarding doubles with agnieszka . )
pretty good form today , huh ?
so you got a little more tight in the second set ?
one mistake or two mistake ? off one mistake you 'll get upset with yourself ?
even though you played enough matches where you know you should n't get that way ?
because you want to be perfect ? even though you know you ca n't be perfect .
is that what happened against cirstea last week ?
and then there were all the crazy things with the challenges with her , right ?
seven ?
and so did that distract you ? because the third set too you were n't really in there .
so today at the end of the set , were you able to calm yourself ?
i know you 've probably been asked this a lot of time about the olympics , but do you know that slovakia has never won a medal in tennis ?
you did ? when ?
that 's right , but it was only experimental then , no ?
that they had n't decided that it was really ...
it still counts ?
now i 'm thinking maybe i 'm wrong . graf won in '88 when she won all her grand slams and the olympics , and that is considered a record . maybe i am wrong .
so you probably never saw any video ?
so it 's a special thing for you ?
so that 's not a grand slam for you , not as important ?
because it maybe means more to the players in tennis ?
i saw canoeing you have 13 medals . how did slovakia get so good in canoeing ?
yeah . they 're good .
so when you go it 's not going to be the highlight of your life ?
because you want to get back to the grass and avenge that ?
but she 's good . she almost beat maria at roland garros .
have you played urszula radwanska ?
2009 .
when you were juniors ?
you played her in juniors also ?
she won in 2007 , aga won junior wimbledon .
did it take you a while to get into the match today ?
you did n't serve particularly well today , but you also did n't face one break point on your serve , i do n't think . so were you just able to just play some of those points better off of those first serves ?
( no microphone . )
i think on her serve you only had four breaks on hers but you converted three of them . do you feel like on some of the bigger points you just played them a little better than she did ?
with the success you had both over in the french open and then at wimbledon , do you feel like your confidence level right now is pretty high ?
( question regarding conserving energy . )
when you lose a tiebreak like that , is it draining ? how did you bounce back so quickly and take another lead ?
did you feel it starting to slip away after 52 or did you still feel pretty confident ?
talk about your entire week here . you got to the finals . you have to be excited going into new york .
did it flare up on you as the match went on ?
how difficult is it losing this way ? you 've done so well here . was it emotional making that decision ?
what did the doctors or trainers say yesterday going into today ? what is wrong with the knee ?
how is it for the us open ?
did you get it examined more thoroughly yesterday and they told you it was a sprain ? what did they tell you it was ?
will you stay here for treatment or go to new york ?
how close were you to not playing today ?
can you talk a little bit about what this tournament has meant to you and your career , looking back at the last five years .
talk about maria , how well she 's playing , what this could mean for her if she was able to win this tournament .
was it more restricting your movement or was it more the pain that made you make the decision ?
if you had won that first set , would you have kept playing , do you think ?
when you 're serving , you always have the ability to ace at any time . when you 're also returning serve as you did tonight , almost makes you unbeatable . when you have that combination going , do you feel good about your game ?
can you talk about kirilenko .
do you think the surface is to your advantage versus grass ?
you 've had an incredible run since montral . what have you found in your hard court game ?
what does it mean to be in the final tomorrow leading up to the us open ?
you 've played all night matches this week . you play during the day tomorrow . do you have a preference ?
this will be your first final in the united states . can you talk about what it means to you to make it to the final , even though it was this way .
did you notice her moving differently , any problems with her movement at all ?
you said she made the right decision . do you think it 's smart just to save yourself with the us open coming up ?
what will you do the night before your first final ? how will you get ready ?
can you tell us what she said when she came over ?
at the end when she retired .
did you start to gain a little confidence as the first set progressed ?
i do n't think there was a breakpoint in the match until the 11th game . were you pretty confident she was not going to be able to break your serve today ?
how have you fared against kvitova or errani in the past ?
you see what this tournament has done for caroline through the years . you come in and see all the billboards with her picture . do you allow yourself to think if you win tomorrow , you can get on a similar roll ? what might this do for you , as well ?
do you have any inside information as to whether there 's going to be a hockey season or not ? do you hope there is ?
can you talk about your confidence level that this week has given you going into the us open , where you are right now in your game ?
with the different surfaces , how different do you think your match with kvitova will be versus the olympics ? are you taking a different approach to it ?
after the olympics you went back to moscow for a little bit . how have you been able to readjust from that experience and keep playing well ?
do you have any pictures of your new car ?
did your mom send you pictures of your new car ?
you have n't seen it yet ?
will alex come tomorrow ?
having seen you play , come up over the years , you 've always been in a situation of top 25 , top 20. suddenly this year the breakthrough has happened , your best year . what is your thinking as to why that is ? is it maturity or what ?
where has your game improved ? what have you gotten better at in the last year or two ?
she has that big serve all the time . when she 's returning your serve as she was today , does that make her almost unbeatable ?
this match aside , did you like how you played here in new haven ? assess your game going into the open .
have you had a chance to look at the draw yet ?
the player you 're playing first ...
do you tend to look just one match at a time ?
having played kvitova today , do you think she 's a real threat at the us open to someone like serena , playing as well as she is now ?
you lost to venus a couple times this summer . can you compare venus ' game with kvitova 's .
can you tell us how the knee is .
can you go over exactly what happened ? when did you feel something ? when did you decide you needed to see a trainer ?
this was during the first game of the second set ?
did you plant it wrong ?
so much success , but you ca n't jeopardize what follows . do you have to guard against maybe not trying to do too much as you try to prepare for the open ?
i saw you looking at your box a couple times . how difficult is the process of , do i continue to play ? do i quit ? how hard was that for you today ?
are you going to get an mri ?
how did it feel as you played those points afterward ?
how relieved were you that you got off the court in two quick sets ?
you said on tv you feel real comfortable here . can you expound on that . what makes new haven special for you ?
how important is that aspect to push you along , to continue playing , even though you needed the timeout , you needed the trainer , but the fact that you 're comfortable here helps you make a decision to continue ?
is this the first time you hurt this particular knee ?
how difficult in your mind is it , given the status of caroline , who hurt her knee , hopefully she 's able to go tomorrow , but does that affect your preparation at all ?
can you talk about how you 're hitting the ball ? seems like you 're in a nice rhythm . happy with where your game is right now ?
quick match today . you had a walkthrough in the second round . are you getting as much work as you like ? is it important that caroline be able to play tomorrow just for your sake ?
you 've won a lot of matches , making your way up the rankings . can you talk about where your game is and your career right now .
yesterday you talked about how you 're familiar with each other 's games . you had success with her . today was it a combination of her doing things differently or you not doing them as well , a combination ?
the unforced errors , things you ca n't control , you 're not able to play as well as you want , does that bother you more than losing ?
you did n't seem to realize immediately what was going on when she called for the trainer . how much of a distraction was that from you ? did you see any difference in her play afterwards ?
how do you feel going into the us open ? you started the summer really well .
obviously a good week for you this week , although you would have preferred today to go better . what did she do ? she just seemed every place .
can you sense the confidence that she 's playing with now when you 're opposite her ?
is it surprising she left here last year thinking she went home , thought maybe she did n't even want to play anymore , and that a year later it could turn around that fast ?
talk about your turnaround . obviously the australian did n't quite go how you would have liked .
this must be a real positive .
there are always players that play better at home with a crowd , and then there are those who that kind of makes them a little bit more nervous and stuff . i mean , i think it 's just probably who you are . but do you have any reason why that seems to be your story that , you know , you have expectations or feel more pressure ?
just your record against azarenka has n't been good . is there something about her game ? is it a return game ? she seems to kind of do a good job of neutralizing your serve . what is it about her game that makes it so difficult for you ?
compared to maybe even last year , has she brought any new weapons to , you know , this week compared to when you 've faced her at the end of last year or early last year ?
do you feel you 've done anything different with your game now than you were doing last month that 's working better for you ?
is there anything you think you can do to change things when you 're at home ? are you like a believer in sports psychology or anything like that ?
we were all expecting some drama with the ankle , but it did n't seem to bother you out there .
how did you feel coming off with the ankle ? going into dubai , do you think it 's going to be something you have to think about ? do you think it was not as serious as you originally thought ? playing today , how did it feel ?
talk about the match . obviously you dominated . what can you say about the match ? what do you feel you did really well against stosur ?
third title of the year . you keep winning . as you keep winning , is the excitement just the same ? is it as exciting to win every time you do it ?
as he said , third title this year . maybe talk about your year . it 's early on , but you 've already got the australian open , you 're no.1 . now a third title . they year is turning out to be , early on , pretty good .
before playing sydney , did you expect that it was going to be better than usual ?
i did n't say that .
did you feel a little bit better than usual ?
sam stosur mentioned confidence . that 's something that 's hard to quantify , but you 've got this winning streak going . i mean , do you go out on the court feeling with that confidence , does that make a big difference ? it 's not like you have a weapon that you did n't have three or four months ago . do you think confidence is a big factor for you doing so well ?
as you said earlier , last year you were watching the game on tv and you were sad because you were not here . so how do you feel ...
pictures . so how does it feel to have your first trophy here in doha ?
one of the things that came out in australia was you know , i think you and maria sharapova both have you 're very vocal during the match with , i guess , whooping or whatever it is . then there was some talk afterwards , i think , but someone said they 're going to start training young kids not do that . someone explained to me that 's kind of how you guys it 's a breathing thing . obviously it 's a little bit of distraction , but if someone said , okay , you ca n't do that anymore , is that something you could go on the court and adjust like that , or is this something that will be with us for your entire career ?
i do , actually .
well , there are ways , i guess .
yeah .
i mean , when people bring this up or people say ...
there you go .
that 's the point that people say is it 's a distraction for other players . i mean , i do n't play i 'm not out there against you . but do you think you talk about confidence being overrated . this whole controversy over yelling and kind of vocals on the court , is this something that 's way overrated and people need to move on to something else ?
djokovic , nadal , and federer will be flag bearers at the olympics . could you be for belarus ? would you like it ?
and 10 out of 11 titles obtained on the hard courts . what do you want to do to improve on grass and clay now ?
did you sense anything , or was it a complete surprise when she pulled out ?
how do you explain you 're playing so well after your australian swing , which did n't go up to your expectations ? do you feel like a weight has lifted off your shoulders ?
even though you did n't get a full match , you must have been happy with the first set the way it went . but then again , you had this momentum , and to have it end that way must have been a little bit disappointing .
you look more confident and comfortable on the court than last month . can you compare how big the difference you feel playing in australia and other part of the world , pressure and attentionwise ?
in terms of dealing with australia , you have to go back there and you 're going to play again , i 'm assuming , but what 's your strategy or how do you overcome that added pressure , anxiety that comes with playing at home ?
some people said the top two players right now have put the fitness of women 's tennis to a new level . you are a player of tougher condition yourself . how do you comment on this ?
maybe you could talk about the match . like you said , you 're very good friends , so it must have been very difficult to see her go down like that and then have to keep playing when she was in so much pain .
no , you and victoria are very good friends . what was your reaction when you saw her fall and get injured ?
when she got injured , i was thinking , well , maybe now you could you won the next game , and i thought maybe you 'd win the set . what happened ? why were n't you able to win the set or keep the match going ?
one of the things you struggled with it seemed was you were getting your serve in but you were n't winning a lot of points , like i think they said 50 % on your first serve and only 28 % on your second . it seemed like your serve was a bit of a challenge today .
just to sum up , you had a pretty good tournament , but to finish like this , i mean , how do you feel now ?
sorry to have to talk to you on this occasion , but maybe you could talk about what happened . it looked like you hit a backhand , and then maybe talk about what happened and how you feel having to pull out and how serious the injury is .
do you think that the fact that you went into the finals in paris , just like you said , you have been playing pretty regularly , so just your body needs a break , basically ?
will you be playing in dubai , or have you made that decision ?
maybe you could talk a little bit about just the match and , you know , what happened out there and how you got through it .
it looked like you were in a lot of pain out there . you were still able to move , but it definitely had a big impact .
winning the match despite your ankle problems , does it mean something more that you were able to win the way you did , even though a lot of people may have pulled out or stopped ?
so you twisted the ankle , or what exactly is the injury ? going into tomorrow , do you think you 'll be 100 % or what can you say ?
maybe you could just talk a little bit about the match . it was a strange one . i mean , you went out so strong in the first , and it seemed like her style of play or something in the second kind of threw you and you came back . talk about that .
given the slow start you had in australia , i mean , what does it mean to reach the semis for the first time this year ?
in the second set was it her style of play or was it more you ? in other words , do you take anything is this a unique match , or did you take anything away from this match that you need to work on in the semis ?
with azarenka being no.1 , i 'm just wondering , you 've seen her play over the years , what 's different about her now than maybe a year ago or two years ago when she was further down in the rankings ?
lastly , along with her and yourself , that 's four different players that have won grand slams . what does that say about the game right now ?
you had a very clean first set , 60 , and then things get a little bit more complicated . how did you leave the second set ?
one of the things yesterday and today , when you got into a little bit of trouble , you really kind of settled down , did n't let it get to you . even last year in dubai i think it was dubai i 'd see moments where , you know , when you get in those same situations you were less certain , you get frustrated . i mean , maybe you can talk about , you know , maybe part of your mental toughness . it seems like you 're much more mature i do n't know if that 's the right word or just more maybe mentally tough on court than maybe you were in the past . i mean , do you feel that way and why is that ?
when we wrote about the australian open , they talked about at one point and they did n't say which year , but they said after doha at one point you considered quitting . was that last year ?
talk about that . so you went back home and your family kind of talked you out of it ? what happened ?
also , you mentioned this earlier in the week , your fitness . one of the commentators noted when you were out there , i think it was one of the 18shot rallies , and your opponent was kind of looking very tired after it . you did n't show any signs of fatigue . i mean , is your fitness , is it at a different level than it was a few months ago , as well ?
obviously less injuries .
i mean , like for fitness , is there anything with your routine that you 've done that you did n't do before , i mean , in terms of specific weights or specific kind of routine ? when you mention fitness , can you be more specific that you did in the offseason that you maybe did n't do before ?
can you talk a little bit about the semifinal match and the possibilities there ?
did you watch christina play last weekend when you were there , worcester ?
we have three firsttime grand slam winner last year , and each of them signed some sponsorship deal . li na got more than ten . i wonder if your agent bring you some good news already ?
and also , can you talk about where does tennis rank in your country based on the popularity ? do you feel you have already helped tennis get even bigger there ?
in your twitter , you said you have a new passion in photography . obviously every day you can see lots of pictures of your own on internet and magazine and newspaper . do you comment , i really like this one , or , this picture is not that great ? can you talk about that ?
after the australian open victory , how has it affected you in terms of when you walk onto the court ? do you feel differently now when you 're taking on an opponent after having won that major ? does it give you more confidence ? what kind of difference does that make for you ?
compared to maybe before the australian open , do you feel opponents are coming after you differently than they were before ? i mean , when you 're on court , is there a big difference that you could attribute to being no.1 or winning the australian open that maybe you did n't feel before ?
can you tell us , please , what made the difference between the first set and the second set ?
what were you telling yourself when you were almost looking at losing the first set ? what kinda got you motivated ? was there a moment when you said , okay , i can get this and win this set ?
it seemed when she lost that first set , the momentum shifted and she seemed to have a lot more problems in the second set . going into the second set , you were able to carry that confidence over and it showed , yeah ?
you played azarenka a couple of times this year . i believe you 've known her for quite a few years . what difference to her game is there when you played against her than what she 's done before ?
in two matches ' time , you could be facing her again . what would you do differently to what you 've done before ?
presumably the lower back that was bothering you during fed cup and when you left australia , that 's all good now ?
is it kind of important for you now in this position to actually , you know , step back and think about your next moves and be smart about how you continue ? because you 're in a different position obviously as no.1 .
are there moments where you say to yourself , wow , i 'm no.1 ? it 's sometimes hard to realize ?
you mentioned the pressure . do you feel it sometimes ? can you be precise about when ? like maybe earlier today , earlier in the match today , rather slow start .
do you have an awareness that there are some people out there who say , well , now we have a legitimate no.1 because she has done well and she also has a grand slam title , and they feel that that 's an important element to being no.1 ?
maybe you already talked about your match , but as you said on court , you started out a little slow . what was going on there , do you think ? did she surprise you , or were you just a little bit sluggish in the beginning ?
what was it about her game that i mean , you said you had n't seen it . what was it about her game that kind of threw you in the beginning ?
it seemed like the key game was the eighth game when you broke her to go up 53 when you had several break chances . did you see that as a key moment in the match ? it seemed after that it just kind of went well , it did . you won the rest of the games except for one .
do you feel that the look of people towards you has changed somewhat since the last two weeks ? if so , can you be specific or when or what circumstances you feel it the most ?
have you bought yourself anything , a present , for your australian open victory or done anything special to commemorate it ?
against ?
have you prioritized what 's ahead this year and what you think is the most important things for you to focus on in terms of maybe tournaments ?
do you recall like the olympics not being a big deal to tennis , or you 're too young for that ?
will you take part in the mixed doubles ?
do you think that 's going to raise the stature of mixed doubles at all that they 've put it in the olympics just overall ?
and look good ?
can you talk a little bit about the racquet switch ? obviously things are going well , but how that 's affected you and stuff .
you said your grandmother inspired you . can you tell us how she inspires you ?
tell us a little bit about it seemed like it was close , obviously , and then the tiebreaker , you know , how it kinda got away from you there .
talk a little bit about your schedule from here . are you going to dubai ?
are you satisfied now with how you 're playing , or do you think you 're looking kinda to find form and tinker with your game , or ...
sounds like you 're a little bit confused . you 're not totally sure why things in the last few weeks are n't kinda working for you . is that accurate ?
what do you think worked well for you today in the match ?
how have you done in the past with her ?
in past matches .
do you sense when you 're on the court with her that she 's lost maybe a little of that confidence ?
compare it to when you played , though , her game . do you think like the players are figuring her out a little bit more and frustrating her ?
i think you played well today . i 'm suggesting that the players have kind of figured out what tactics work against her well .
where do you think that she was vulnerable today that caused you to win the match ?
easy firstround match . do these easy matches help early in the tournament ?
is it always a policy to take match by match ? you do n't worry about meeting different players in the tournament ?
it 's your first match as world no.1 . were you eager to play it ? were you looking for more holidays ? what was your state of mind before this ?
can you tell us a little bit what was your week after the australian open like ? what did you do ? tell us a little bit about it .
yeah .
to la ?
is it actually a lot of baggage to be no.1 , or is it just in your head ?
it seemed pretty even out there and then it got away in the third set . can you tell us what happened ?
anything in particular in your game that you thought was going wrong , or could you pinpoint it ?
it 's been a long ride for you from this time last year to where you are now in the rankings . but still , weeks like this , are they frustrating ? because of where you are now , is it easy to up and go , or ...
an olympics question for you . do you feel like tennis has always been a part of the olympics ? because you 're like the first generation that kind of grew up thinking tennis and olympics , i would think .
you played kvitova last week in the fed cup . do you think in a way that kvitova and azarenka have sort of pulled away from the rest of you guys ?
i 'm just wondering , do you look at azarenka as a more legitimate no.1 than wozniacki because she had n't won a grand slam ? there is obviously people who feel that because she played often and played deep that she deserved it , and then there are people who feel like you have to win the grand slam .
so you had no questions with wozniacki being ...
what are your main goals for 2012 ?
did the weather have an impact on the way you played today ?
could you tell us how close you are to the game you played when you were no.1 in the world ? how has the year been so far formwise for you ?
navratilova said yesterday that azarenka and kvitova are playing a different kind of game and they have taken the game to another level . do you think it 's very different from the time you were no.1 ? how difficult is it going to be for you to get back ?
do you think you can challenge them and be no.1 again ?
strange match . each set seemed to be a little different .
how is it to be playing against kvitova ? she 's really powerful . how tough is it to be playing against her ?
you had some comebacks against her in the past . you had a big comeback yesterday . were you thinking any point in the third set , okay , time for the rally now ?
we saw the wrap on your knee there , the brace . was your knee a factor at all in this match , your leg ?
very good start to the hard court season . how do you see the next tournament in cincinnati and then the us open ?
how good does that feel ?
you get to convince yourself now too that north america does n't have to be a bad place for your asthma ?
what do you think the key was to your good games and your championship ?
what were you thinking after you lost 16 points in a row , something like that , to start the second set ? how do you come back in the game ?
do you have a nice spot for that trophy at home ? what kind of confidence does this give you heading into the us open ?
na li is a really good fighter . what made you believe after the second set that it was possible for you to bounce back ?
how amazing does that feel ?
were your legs a little heavy at the end of the match or hard to get into the match ? because she hit so hard . you had a tough day yesterday .
after you beat radwanska you said it was unbelievable and you do n't know how you did it . now you 're into the final , do you believe it and do you know how you did it ?
what 's going through your mind when you 're down 51 , staying in there ?
and when did you have that feeling that you still were in it , had a chance to win it , it was definitely changing and the momentum was now yours ? when did it kind of strike you , 53 , 52 , 54 ?
when it was 51 in the match , at this point you had broken her just once and you did that three times afterwards . what did you change in her service ?
you said you were talking to yourself when you were down . what were you telling yourself ?
how did you find the right way to stabilize your forehand ?
i did n't say it was bad . but you were making more mistakes to go down 51 , and then after that you did n't make any more mistakes .
you will face caroline or petra in the final . can you talk about your encounters with them and how you feel about facing one or the other ?
as best i can tell , you were n't even in kindergarten the last time a canadian was in the quarterfinals . do you take some pride out of what you accomplished tonight ? how does this set you up for confidence in the weeks ahead ?
are you starting to get to the point where you cringe whenever you see that you 're having to play caroline ? because this is nine times i think you 've played . she seems to have something on you .
losing is always difficult , of course . are there good losses ? are there losses where you finish and say , i 'm right there ?
is wozniacki a thorn in your side ?
she played two hours and a half , a very tough match , and had a very short break before playing you . did you think before the match it was a good opportunity for you to beat her ?
stepping back , it was a good week with you reaching the quarterfinal for the first time in the montreal tournament ?
what was the game plan ? trying to play long rallies to make her tired ?
you played perfect backhands , but often your forehand ended up at the bottom of the net . was it because of her or because of you ?
can you compare your level with 2009 ?
she said that it only felt like your arm was warmed up for that because it did n't seem like you played twoandahalf hours . is that what you felt ?
your matchup for the semifinal , it gives you a chance to move on to the final . it 's been a while since we have had someone here in montreal win backtoback years in montreal . your thoughts on that and what stands in your path .
you have had so many matches with aleksandra . i think this was the ninth . won eight of them and the other one you retired . what is it you 've got going against her to win that ?
you ended up putting a patch or bandage of some sort on your upper shin or lower knee , whatever . what was bothering you ? is winning the cure ?
what 's the situation ? obviously that 's a disappointing result . there were a couple of chances to come back in that second set . talk about the match .
what do you do about consistency at the moment ? because things just have n't been there , have they , since the french ? do you feel it 's a technical aspect , or is it just the mental aspect ?
are you worried about it ?
you were runnerup there , were n't you , in toronto ?
do you know how much of an effect , if at all , it will have on your ranking , not defending those points ?
what have you got coming up ?
tournamentwise , before going into the us open , what have you got ?
would you consider playing , let 's say , new haven , as well , to try to get a few more matches under your belt ?
are you going to head there to cincy like tomorrow or when ?
you were saying that against her you should take initiatives and be aggressive , but apparently it did n't work out .
when she plays at that level , could you compare her game to serena 's or sharapova 's ?
you were saying after sandiego you were on a good roll . is this going to stop you , or will you be able to forget ?
can you tell us why you 're pulling out ?
it 's obviously been an ongoing issue . is it something that likely will affect you through the rest of the month ?
is it a shortterm thing , or are we talking ...
are you going to cincinnati now ?
i suppose that your goal will be to be ready for the us open ?
what did you like best about your match today ?
do you feel the power of experience sometimes in moments like that ?
what 's it mean that it 's here in montreal ?
getting to the third round .
petra kvitova last night was talking about the difficulty of transitioning from grass to hard court because there has been so much grass this month with wimbledon and the olympics . how have you found that ?
it 's the first time in five meetings you 've beaten jankovic .
how was this one different other than just winning it ?
tell us about the relationship between yourself and eugenie . there has been a lot of talk obviously about how well she 's been playing . what kind of advice do you give her and what 's the relationship between the two of you ?
you were not playing your best tennis , yet this victory was impressive .
what was that strategy or game plan ?
you seemed more confident than in your first match and your serve worked out well today .
how does it feel to play at home ?
so far you had an excellent year .
what can you say about your next opponent , whichever it is ?
you lost four times against jankovic . at what moment in the match did you start believing you could win ?
you also returned a lot better .
and jankovic seemed to make many mistakes .
it was a long time you had n't beaten a top 20 player .
were you surprised by the result ?
is it rare to have an opponent play as bad as you thought she played today ?
which was the key of the match ? your slice ?
can you talk a little bit about the opponent tonight ?
how difficult was it with the rain delay and not knowing when you were going to play ?
did you feel any extra pressure especially there at the end when the rain started coming down ? i 'm sure you just wanted to finish that match , as well ?
were you impressed by her play ? she was playing on center court , not easy for her playing one of the best players in the world .
how bad was your back today ? was it your back ?
what were your thoughts on the match ?
is she improving ?
i was going to ask about the same question . it was your fifth game against wozniak . would you say you saw a better or different wozniak today ?
you played four times against her before today .
wimbledon .
just wondering how you feel about yourself , your game , your health and everything from now into the us open .
( off microphone . )
did it surprise you as it was happening , as it was unfolding ? did you feel like you were trying to figure out some way to turn it around ?
has anything like that ever happened ? has that ever happened to you before ?
( off microphone . ) did you speak to her after her loss ?
your coach was not here earlier in the week when you first got here . it was interesting to see you sort of walking around all by yourself and doing your own thing . was there a reason he was n't here ? was that strange to you , as well ?
are you happy with this good start ?
why did everything improve in sandiego ?
were you surprised that the match went so fast against peng , who is a really good player ?
what did you do during your 10 days at home ?
kvitova ?
do you feel fresh now for the upcoming season ?
am i correct in assuming that you seemed a little bit tired out there ? was that a result of the big olympic run you had until the quarterfinals ?
the match seemed to turn on the rain delay there . you dropped the first set , then 44. was the rain delay a factor , do you think , or was it that the opponent seemed to have an injury ?
is it good to get a match like that out of the way going into the rest of the tournament if you 've overcome some adversity , maybe ?
the game seemed to take a while to pick up speed . there was n't a whole lot of rhythm . is it hard to get involved in that kind of a game ?
what did you like best about your victory in singles on center court today ?
you even have a tougher match rankingswise against li na . look ahead for us .
you do n't seem to be intimidated by any of this . i think that surprises all of us . i mean , that 's the first bigtime match on a big tour . it 's a big moment . there you are .
is it my impression the last couple of months that you have started playing a little more aggressively ?
you seemed to have a lot of confidence in your net game .
you 're obviously full of potential and promise now . we 're starting to see results . do you think like there is more pressure or expectations for you to fulfill that potential ?
i just wondered , what do you think of what you have done this summer , winning all these tournaments , winning junior wimbledon , you know , winning some matches on the wta . what 's your feeling about it ? is it something you thought you could do all along , or have you surprised yourself ?
can you talk about how you were able to not let the pressure get to you in that third set and really stay evenkeeled throughout it ?
how can you see how different the crowd was ? i know you said when you were playing in wimbledon it was biggest crowd you 've seen . how different was it playing at home ?
i wanted to ask you , did shahar peer play any differently than what you expected going into the match ?
after three hours of tennis like this , can you talk about your performance with aleks ?
are you going to feel tired against li na tomorrow ?
you were obviously tired , both of you , at the end of that match but you were able to raise your level and win it . does this boost your confidence , beating a top 50 player ? it 's the bestranked player you have beat .
at 5all you had a break point against you , and you stayed calm and collected and you were able to keep focusing . how did you do that ?
tomorrow is going to be an even more difficult match against a top10 player .
can you talk about the crowd today ?
looking back on that match , what pleased you most ?
it 's been a wonderful summer for you . how do you explain this ? is it because you have more experience now or because you changed something in your practice ?
how do you rank this victory today ?
several times you missed your toss when serving . was it because of the wind or was it a technical problem ?
so what do you think made the difference today ?
now your reward for playing so well is a game against azarenka . how are you going to deal with that ?
when you saw how the draw unfolded , do you think it was like a tough break , goerges and then azarenka ?
do you think it might be an advantage since she came back from london like yesterday , i think , and it 's been high emotions for her lately ?
is it an easy transition going from grass to the hard courts ?
you have the london olympic games shirt on . can you describe that experience , what it was like ?
looking back on the first game of the third set , you had a couple of chances at net .
was that a key point there ?
it was a strange game . seemed like she could n't win her serve until that 43 game .
i thought it was interesting if you looked at the match overall there were a lot rallies that you were controlling . they seemed to be going your way . then you set yourself up for the point , and then it was at that moment that it did n't happen for you .
will you replay the first set in your mind and just take all the positives out of that ? how do you mentally look at a match like that when you dominate a highranked player in the first set ?
do you think your emotions got the best of you in that third set ?
what happened after the first set ?
had you played her already ?
you broke her serve several times in the first set , but then you did n't seem to be able to do that again after . why ?
we felt you were frustrated .
how do you get to play at noon in this weather ?
yeah .
as you get older and your career progresses , the runnerup finishes , do they get easier , harder , are they all different ? what would you say ?
you were not able to jump on her serve the way you did the previous matches , and she does n't have a lot of pace . is it just simply your timing that you feel was off , or is there something about her real slow serves that make it difficult ?
it seems that the last game the forehand particularly let you down .
so do you think when there are that many errors , how much is it you and how much is the way that she 's playing is making you make more errors ? i know you do n't have an exact percentage , but if you could kind of explain .
how is your serve working these days ? how did it feel today , your shoulder and the way you 've had to adjust your serve ?
overall making the final here , how do you go home ? how do you put this tournament in perspective with your season so far ?
is it frustrating when you have to generate so much of the pace yourself ?
you got broken twice at the end of each set . did you feel like your nerves let you down today ?
you were three hours and a half more than agnieszka . do you feel it was a factor today ?
you had some good results on clay last year . are you looking forward to clay this year ?
great display of very intelligent tennis out there today . were you surprised that you were able to keep it together so proficiently ?
what was your strategy , your tactical strategy against maria going in ?
but you had lost to her many times in a row . how does it feel ? did you do something differently , or is your game just elevated now ?
the intensity of the other tournaments you 've won , the other successes you 've had in your career , how does this compare ? how big a win is this for you ?
last year when you won tokyo tournament you said you are going to buy a bag or something , expensive bag or something since you got the prize money . this time you get even bigger prize money . i was wondering what this time you are going to buy .
can you talk a little bit about the development of your game from the time you were young , what your father taught you about the game ? because you certainly have a distinctive style that incorporates a lot of different shots . can you talk about how he taught you or how your coaches taught you to play ?
the dropshot that you have , sort of that tricky dropshot , how did you learn that ?
you do n't make a lot of noise or expressive behavior on court . are you nervous out there , or are you as cool as it looks from the outside ?
you played the firstround matches on the outside courts , and then you moved on the stadium court and you won them all . some of the other players have complained about the fact that the stadium court is a lot slower than the outside courts . i was wondering what your view is on that .
you mentioned out there your father left today , he flew back to poland . was that the plan because you did n't expect to be in the final , or was he going to leave anyway ?
did you change your plane ticket , or did you have a plane ticket until tomorrow ?
i know with the style of play that you have that you do n't hit a lot of winners , but were you still surprised with just one winner you still won the first set ?
can you talk about what level of tennis did your father play when he was a professional ? have you ever seen him play on tape ?
what level of play did he reach in his career ?
did he coach you and your sister like at the same time ? how did it work with your sister ?
now that you 're no.4 , i mean , 1 is much closer , and 2 and 3. can you talk about what are your goals now that you have reached this pinnacle of your career ?
you were so solid all the last year . what things changed the last year ?
but you feel you improve a lot the last year or not ?
being from krakow , one of the nicest things is that you bring a very positive impact on your country . as you may know , many americans think of krakow 70 years ago of a place of death , death camps of world war ii . growing up , this is something boris becker and steffi graf said when they were young , they always felt they want to get rid of any thoughts people thinking about the nazis or the bad words . i just want to know , with you being very involved today and being perhaps poland 's no.1 athlete , if you feel that you 're part of making people thinking of poland in a very positive aim because of your excellence in sports .
how much does your new coach traveling with you contribute to today 's success ?
how did you develop that crouching shot ? it 's very acrobatic out there .
the one where you crouch down low .
does it make you feel better that the replay on television showed that the serve was actually on the line ?
does it make you feel better that the replay showed that maria 's serve at the end actually was on the line ?
you seemed to have other problems with him throughout the match , kind of , or later in the match ?
other than that ?
you had a good comeback in the first set . what 's your overall feeling about the match ?
was that a contrast of styles out there ? i mean , with her , she 's just so aggressive versus the way that you were playing her .
what 's the challenge , i guess , that she poses ?
given how good you are as a retriever and how good your defense is , are you surprised that she stays in those rallies as long as she does , in many of them hitting the ball the way she does and as hard as she does ?
overall with your game , you had some good results here this week .
last we heard , you were not able to get into charleston to defend . has there been any change in that situation ?
will you go to augusta ?
tough match ?
it appears that your mobility has improved . do you feel that yourself , or is it just a perception that some of us have ?
movement , yeah .
did you feel like you were going for as much on your first serve as you usually do ?
you have been in the final three times and lost every one of them . it 's a strange statistic . does that give you some extra incentive needed to get rid of that statistic ?
you mean you used to come as a spectator when you were younger ?
going back to when ?
yeah .
so the game plan of the day was just to be on the attack ?
you 're such an competitor . you seem so eager to compete . are there ever times when you just do n't have it in you and want to go out there and fight , get knocked down and get up , keep fighting , do what you got ta do ?
next up , bartoli or radwanska , can you talk about the strategy possibly for them ?
that service game , it was starting to slip away a little bit .
i was watching your wimbledon final , the first one when you won , on tennis channel the other day . do you ever watch that as sort of a bit of inspiration ? i have forgotten how well you played in that match . have you looked at the tapes at all ?
so when was the last time you hit a service winner and two aces at break point down to win a set ?
what was the difference today ? you met her six times before , lost five consecutive times . what was the strategy going into this match ?
did you notice that she looked a little tired ? if so , at what point in the match did you notice ?
but from your perspective , did she look tired ?
i know you play a very allcourt game . seemed like you were drawing her into net with a lot of short balls even more than usual . was that part of your strategy against her weapons today ?
she changed her strategy very dramatically in the first set . she started to attack almost like she thought , well , i 'm not gon na win this if i stay back . i have to come in . did you consider that kind of a moral victory for you at that point ?
you guys kept breaking each other in the first set . then she started serving and coming into the net . everything went past her . did you find she was a little desperate , or ...
i know you 're very close friends with caroline . have you two talked about that you 're both playing williams sisters here in this round and now you both managed to win ?
what did you two say to each other ?
caroline also served extremely well , and her backhand was little stronger . i noticed in your game also today . how do you feel overall how you played today ?
yes .
why did you feel you had nothing to lose when you 're no.5 in the world and she 's no.134 and 31 years old ?
how much do you work on your fitness ? you look so fresh out there . anything special ?
are you as calm inside as you look to us when you 're out on that court ?
is that calmness something you 've always had ? because in here you 're very smiley , but on court , totally nothing .
i know you said at indian wells if you did have to play victoria you wanted to be in the final . here it could be in the semifinal , which is not too bad , i guess . what are your thoughts going into another match with her potentially ? are you hoping that maybe you do n't have to play her ?
what would you have to do differently to beat victoria if indeed it 's her you have to face ?
how is your shoulder feeling ?
there is a distinction here this year with the top players . you see azarenka doing well , and maria and petra . i think you guys are playing really strong . do you feel like you belong to this group , that you feel like your aspirations and dreams , it 's your moment right now ?
seemed like you were struggling on the return a bit throughout the match . is that something you think was a big factor in what happened out there today ?
how did you felt in the game ?
at the end of the second set you started coming back . how did you feel when you got back to , you know , when she was serving 54 ?
on a day when you 're not feeling 100 % , making more mistakes , she has to be a nightmare opponent to play in that she got so many balls back .
i know you had a high percentage . did you feel like you served as well as you wanted to ?
all losses are tough , but is it tougher when you lose close to home ?
were you anxious at all or excited ? because it seemed like you were asking yourself to calm down at times .
do you think it might have helped you if you actually had gone through that ?
it seems like she was serving a little harder today . like you had more unforced errors in your return of serve . was that you or her ?
usually she 's so solid , but knowing that the last times she surprise you , she 's so solid today , she was so concentrate today . maybe she played the match of the year .
do you think shot selection was also an issue ? when you were volleying , it seemed like a lot of your balls were landing in the middle and she was able to pass you pretty easily .
why do you say you played 20 % ?
it was a little breezier , also . we could see your dress in the wind . did that influence your game or your ...
your sister has been doing something pretty incredible this week here , making it all the way to the quarterfinals her first tournament back . are you gon na stick around and watch her ?
yesterday when roger lost to roddick he said he was playing a player that was a no.1 player , not a 34 player . how about you tonight ? you 're both former no.1 players . did you feel like a champion right there , playing as if she was the no.1 , also ?
anything that really surprised you of this game in her ?
what do you think to do so that you do n't make so many unforced errors next time ?
how are you physically ?
with the style of tennis you play , there are n't many matches you win with singledigit winners . what is that an adjustment you made when you saw how she was playing ?
it 's been a while . you have been hitting your groundstrokes incredibly well . she made a lot of errors , but they were long rallies and just kept the ball in play . how do you account for that ? it 's been for a while now , actually .
do you feel that you 're a much better player now than you were when you last won a major ? how would you rate yourself now compared to when you last won a major ? do you feel you 're an allaround better player ?
i want to ask you about more of a personal question . i think a lot of your fans think of you as very glamorous person , and yet a lot of your opponents think you as one of the fiercest fighters on the tour . how do you reconcile those two parts of you ?
one supplemental question : where are you more comfortable , on red carpet ? at a photo shoot ? on the practice court ? you know , at a tournament on court ?
you talk about grinding out matches and hard work . how nice is it , this deep in the tournament , to have a match just over an hour ?
do you think you have any benefit or advantage for being beautiful ?
no , in your job .
( indiscernible . )
those days when you go to sleep at 9:30 dead tired and you 're looking at a string of them , far away from all this hubub and stuff , is it difficult for you to get out of bed the next morning and get yourself back out on that practice court ?
you talk about having a busy schedule . have you had time to set any sort of date yet for your wedding ?
you have been one of the most consistent players this year , along with azarenka . the consistency in the top 10 and having a rivalry brewing , how do you think that helps the tour ?
what do you think of the wta 's strong is beautiful campaign ?
what are you reading these days ?
heavy reading , eh ?
is there a theme here , underlying theme ?
the next round you could play either serena or caroline . caroline you played a lot in 2011 and before that , with serena you have had less success . talk about each of those opponents and the successes and challenges .
do you ever find yourself paying any attention to these other storylines that develop through a tournament , like the comeback of venus williams making it to the quarterfinals ?
do you ever watch any of her matches ?
streaming ?
aside from competition , what are some other ways that you 're a very stubborn person ?
do you feel fortunate in a way with getting through that match when it was pretty tough ?
how about the double faults ? are you worried at all ?
you 've gotten through the first two rounds despite them . will they catch up with you at some point ?
off the subject , but a few weeks ago you played a point with rory mcilroy , right ?
number one , could you assess his abilities ? number two , did you throw the point ? number three , do you play golf ?
you hit long on purpose ?
can you talk about what it adds when the williams sisters are in a tournament ? people say women 's tournaments lack rivalries , and you and serena had such a great rivalry for such a long time . what does it bring when they 're both in the field ?
have you watched them both play ? how do you think they 're doing , considering both of their layoffs ?
how would you compare the penn balls at this tournament to wilson balls or balls at other tournaments ? which better suits your game ?
so you think more of it 's more conditions rather than balls ?
do you ever stick around and scout an opponent or on a day off go watch an opponent , a possible future opponent ?
i want to ask another equipment question about stringing . some players are very , very particular and like to change the strings based on weather and stuff like that . how particular are you about the stringing of the racquet ? do you have your own stringer ? do you use the ones onsite ?
uhhuh . you 're not into the science ?
this is the first tournament kind of where everyone 's back : the williams sisters are back ; kim clijsters came back ; pretty much the entire wta tour is healthy . can you discuss the depth of the wta tour right now , you know , again , presuming health of everyone ? do you think it 's the deepest it 's been in a while ?
do you think there was any particular turning point in the match ?
of course it must be encouraging to know that you played so good , but the disappointment must be tough .
did you watch the match yesterday , the wozniak and venus williams match ?
how much do you feel she raised her game at the end of the match ?
it was a great match . of course sad for you . you were playing absolutely perfect . you know , all your strokes and going for everything . at 3love , you know , in the second set , you know , still , your game was still working . you had to do something different in that second set . what would you have done ?
where did you find the strength to hit that last serve ? last serve was 119 .
how tired were you ?
can you compare the feelings after these two pretty different wins for you ? 6love in the third and very high ranked player , and the other one you fight to save the match point to get out against somebody who is another wildcard like you . how does the emotion compare ?
judging from that last answer , the confidence , does it ever waiver ? does it waiver like in a match like this where you seem to be down and all of a sudden you pick it up ?
is it all about the olympics for you ? is that like tunnel vision ?
what is it about the olympics ? you have been there a few times and been successful . what about the olympics is so important to you ?
are you hoping to play both singles and doubles in london ?
have you thought about mixed at all ?
that 's a lot of tennis .
presuming your singles ranking is going to determine whether you go in or out , is that on your mind ?
after the match you said , i needed this match . can you elaborate on the way or ways you felt you needed it ?
have you calculated your ranking now and what you need to do to get there ? are you sitting there with all the numbers ?
when your dad came on court after the match , what did he say to you as you walked off together ?
how much selfknowledge do you have now about your condition and about how much a match like this could take out of you , how well you might feel tomorrow morning ? is this all still something you have to deal with on a daytoday basis ?
the other part of it , is it an emotional battle ? as much as you have been training to get back and taking great care with your diet and everything else , how much do emotions fatigue you , or , for that matter , give you energy ?
was there a time when you thought you might not play again , or you always knew that you would ?
what do you do with the pins ? i know you collected a lot in beijing , for sure .
talk about the all the people here watching you today and what that meant to you .
how would you judge your energy level at the end of the match ? was it because she was playing so much better ?
( indiscernible . )
ana or daniela next ?
your experience with them ?
interesting match . she 's the kind of player you have to beat all the time to get back to where you want to be . is that a difficult situation ? does that make it a little tense out there ?
she 's a particularly dangerous player to play when she could hit 15 winners in a row and make a lot errors . does that make her difficult ?
things seem to be coming together for you now . any reason you think that things are starting to gel again ?
you get venus williams next . like i said before , you played a lot of times before . what are your thoughts about her ? have you seen any of her play this week ?
i know this happened before with you and daniela when you 're wearing the same outfit on court . what are your thoughts on that happening or you know it 's going to happen ?
venus is admittedly obsessed with going to a fourth olympics . obviously the olympics did n't work out the way you would have preferred in beijing . is that something that 's a big focus for you this year ?
will you played in the mixed doubles ?
is it hard to keep your faith and optimism this year if you do n't get back where you want to be right away ? you have to change coaches or you have injury and you slip back a little bit . is it day to day ? is it difficult to force yourself ?
when did you and nenad decide you were going to play together ?
before your serve was an issue . is it one of the areas you feel is coming back and that nigel has really helped you with ?
done before lunch , huh ?
how did you feel you played ?
you were there last night to watch her ?
do you like playing early , 11:00 a.m. ?
maybe you should n't hate them .
what do you hate about them ?
how did you follow venus ' match ?
when petra won the second set did you get worried ?
you look like you played into the match , very conservative , steady from the baseline and just ripping your serve today .
do you feel good about your serve though today ?
you play sam stosur in your next match , us open final rematch . what are your thoughts on getting another match with her ?
have you thought back on the us open final at all ? for a while , that was your last match for a long time . do you think back to what you could have done differently in that match ?
one thing about starting so early is you 've got all the rest of the day now .
you 're in miami . do you take advantage ?
i heard you had babysitting duties last night .
did you break it up and get bit ?
how hungry are you to raise a trophy again ? it 's been since toronto last august .
are there any particular records you have your eye on ?
overall titles ?
what is your best memory that you have about roland garros ?
just pick one of the memories .
when you say winning , you mean the match point or ...
you still have an apartment in paris ?
you train at the actual roland garros site or one of the academies there ?
how do you feel about your game on clay at this point ? do you feel you 're as tough on that surface as any ?
is it like riding a bicycle , you think ?
seemed like a match where the scoreline was reflective of how it went , tough start , and then ...
you said you do n't hang around the locker rooms , but how much did you know about her game or her personality ?
you 're into the fourth round for the eighth time in nine showings . what is it about this tournament and the conditions that really suits your game ?
do you think it 's harder to face somebody that 's new for you ?
is your family here with you ? is your dad living in florida now ?
where is he now ?
are you one of the spokespeople or representatives for the winter olympics in sochi ?
are you going , planning on going ?
makarova is a player who can step it up in bigtime way .
have you had a chance to follow the comeback of kleybanova at all ?
do you have any plans like federer , tsonga ? they 're going to be in south america in the end of the year . do you have any plans out of the regular tournaments ?
yes .
can you talk about just what happened out there today ? seemed like you were having a tough time consistency off the ground , from what i could tell .
is there anything in particular about the slow start ? was it that she got off fast and you 're trying to catch up ? was there anything in particular ?
sounds like you 're chalking a lot of this up to lack of match play ; is that fair to say ?
what 's your schedule like from now to the french open ?
( no microphone . )
it seemed a little bit warmer out today . did that have any impact on how you were moving ?
so access to outdoor courts has been an issue for you ? you 're training belgium ? is there anything you can do before madrid and rome outdoor to prepare for that ?
you 're not just someone who can pick up and train in florida like a lot of players do ?
can you talk about how do you feel about victoria 's run this year ? are you surprised she 's still unbeatable until today ?
so how do you feel ? you do n't look tired or old out there .
yeah , i think so .
no , how did you feel ?
you just won a third set 6love over the no.3 player in the rankings . after having not played , how gratifying is that after everything you 've been through ?
on paper it looks like a big step forward for you . do you see it that way ?
did you expect coming in that you might be able to beat some of these top players right away ?
one thing people were wondering about after your first match where you did so well was what your recovery would be like stringing matches together . did you feel physically different between the second and firstround match ?
did you surpass harold 's bedtime ?
how did you feel in that third set physically ?
a bunch of people online and twitter seemed upset that your match and your first set were n't televised . were you aware of that ?
do you find after a long layoff like this that you enjoy the tennis more , appreciate it more ?
seems like it , yeah .
have you talked at all to alisa ?
looked a little bit like your second serve was the only chink in the armor out there . anything you can do different , or is it just a matter of getting more match play to get the serve going again ?
what do you see going ahead ? you have aleksandra wozniak in the next round . i know you have played her before .
you played her in australia .
i want to ask you a question about roland garros . what 's your best memory related to roland garros ? it could be one of your matches or something happened to you in general in paris . your best memory ?
so talk about the match . incredibly tough and back and forth . what was it like for you ?
she had said before the match she was n't sure how well she was going to be able to play against you because she 's been off tour recovering from her illness . what did she seem like to you ? she looked pretty darn good out there .
what do you need to do right now for your game , do you think ? what do you think you need to work on after this ?
do you think it was your fitness that hurt you in the third set ?
what did you first think when you saw venus ' name next to you in the draw ?
but you do have some good memories from playing her early in your career in memphis , though ?
how was your breathing tonight ?
you said you 're going to turkey ?
what are you doing in turkey ?
all offcourt mostly , or ...
also you made your debut on twitter today ?
what do you think about that ?
i have a question about roland garros . i 'd like to know what is your best memory related to roland garros ? not especially about your match , but in general your best memories .
you had a relatively tough straightset match today . i know you played her in australia . anything different this time around , do you think ?
i know after you pulled out of the indian wells semifinal you said you were getting an mri . how did that turn out ?
do you feel like you still have the momentum here from your good run in indian wells , though ?
what kind of treatment are you taking ?
on rankings , with this win you now move up to being the no.1 serbian woman for the first time since 2008 .
what are your thoughts about that ?
what kind of wine ?
there was a stretch of slams in '07 and '08 where you played venus williams three straight times . you beat her at the australian . what are your thoughts and what it might be playing like if you might play her here on her comeback ?
scale of 1 to 10 , let 's say indian wells is 10 , where do you put your condition now ?
it 's been said that a champion always find , you know , the way in a tough match . you were in a little trouble in that second set . what happened there ? how did you get out of it ?
you 're going on 240 right now , a great winning streak . some have compared your season to djokovic 's . do you think you could finish with the same intensity and trying to get more wins and continue that streak ? how does it feel to be compared to his winning streak last year ?
i have a question about roland garros . i would like to know ...
i 'd like to know what is your best memory related to roland garros ? not especially one of your matches but in general , your best memory ?
you have won four titles this year . what do you think is the reason for this at the beginning of the year ?
is there any sense of fatigue at the moment ?
your next opponent , heather watson , who you played at the australian open earlier this year . she was struggling a little bit at that point , but i just wonder what you remember about that match ? it was one you won comfortably , but what do you know about her ?
love5 .
talk about and evaluate your serve . talk about how that 's progressed .
you have a great team with you .
what 's so special about your coach and your relationship with him ? how does he motivate you ?
it seems more and more players play golf between matches to relax .
yeah .
your level of maturity seems different now . now you 're no.1 ; now you won a slam . when you finish the match , you pat her on the back . you have showed her some sympathy for that moment . do you see yourself in their place sometime ? because you 're in a different place right now .
during the last few years there have been many female players who won one grand slam and have been a little while as world no.1 . you have now won the australian open and are the world no.1 . what is important now to keep winning and keep staying at the level you are ?
your grandmother , of course she 's very happy when you won the grand slam , but how did it mean to you to be you know , you became no.1 ; you achieved your dreams . how did it feel like through a relationship with her ? what did she say to you ?
do you feel like it was a test for you as first match of the year ? what 's your opinion about your opponent today ?
yes .
do you feel rusty at all ?
what was it like to be back out there ? you played a lot of big matches out there , but it 's been a long time .
you seemed frustrated the second set ; return of serve was not what you liked it to be and you were like screaming at yourself . did it come on at all ?
everyone was wondering , how will serena look ? how is she going to play ? when you say you were nervous at the beginning , were you even wondering yourself how you were going to do , curious , or did you have a good sense how you were going to play ?
do you get nervous as you get older ? less ?
do you still feel like when you 're playing your best , do you feel you 're still the best player to beat on the planet ?
you 've done well against victoria in the past , and petra is there now and wozniacki . if you take the court on any given day , do you feel you can still beat them ?
sloane stephens was talking about how you became friendly at fed cup . can you talk about what your relationship was like with her the past few weeks and what you think of her ?
tennis advice ?
does she remind you of yourself at all at that age ?
venus playing yesterday , having her back in the game and on the court , how does that affect you ?
have you noticed a difference in her physically ? like does she get tired more often than she used to ?
have you adopted any of her vegan ways yourself ?
can you talk about just being that close ? you started off in the same room together and you were obviously close when you were little kids . but for two sisters at your age to be so close still ...
you still are that close ? like you talk about things with her a lot ?
do you guys ever help each other out like with your fashion ventures ?
how are you physically ? the ankle ? hammy is taped . how frustrating is that , just these nagging injuries ?
you and venus being closer , are you playing a lot more of the same tournaments now ? you 're both playing charleston in a few weeks and both played eastbourne last summer . can you talk about how the transition has happened over the years wanting to spend more time together ?
john isner was just in here talking about mixed doubles at the olympics saying he 'd like to have one of the sisters as his partners .
are you hoping to play mixed ?
what do you think that would be like , mixed doubles in the olympics ?
what do you think the olympics at wimbledon will be like ? what do you anticipate ?
i remember you talked in australia about being on a tv show as a guest star , but you could n't talk about it . can you talk about that now ?
have you changed the way you train at all to reduce the wear and tear on your body ? do you want to keep it going as long as you can ?
yesterday your sister brought her dog into the presser . do you travel with your dog , as well ?
you had quite a battle out there . talk about how the match proceeded and what got you through .
was there any point where you thought really kind of turned it for you , got you where you wanted to go ?
is it always a huge relief to get through the first match ? she 's really a tough opening match for you .
what do you think olympic tennis at wimbledon is going to be like ?
where does the olympics rank on your list of priorities this year ?
at the top ?
would you be available for mixed doubles ?
that 's a lot of tennis .
talking about the conditions , everyone always talks about switching over from the desert in indian wells to here . how was it today ? humid ? less humid ? hard transition ?
have you played under the lights on centre court yet at wimbledon ?
yeah .
they 're talking about some of the matches , because of the schedule they 'll probably close it and play past 8:00. what do you think about that ?
what was it like playing under the roof ? what do you remember about it ?
can you talk about where you draw the strength from ? like today shahar really looked like she was coming on , the crowd is cheering for her , you know , at 43 in the third , and then all of a sudden you just seemed to kind of take it up a notch or something , some fire gets going . what are you telling yourself in those moments to give yourself that edge ?
regarding wimbledon , i think you wo n't have to wear white then .
so you have obviously with your seed dropping down , being unseeded here , you can play tougher players out of the gates . your second match in a few months . how is that tougher for you ?
you still think you have a long way to go from where you played today , that improvement to where you get to to contend for this title and make a deep run here ?
i know you said yesterday that your mind ca n't be on tennis as much as it used to be because you 're obviously much busier at home . when you 're at a tournament , how is your schedule different ? is your daughter here with you ?
how is your schedule different ?
does she come to matches or practice ?
how did it feel out there ?
were you surprised at how fast the start was , 6love ?
you seemed so excited afterwards . was it obviously the emotions and not being able to play ?
i know you said you felt a lot of uncertainty with how you 're feeling day to day , week to week . how sure were you that you were going to play this tournament at all ?
i saw you played doubles at fed cup , and you played pretty well there . how much better are you playing now than then ?
were you feeling totally energetic today ? any fatigue ? how did you feel out there ?
what kind of dog ?
you tried to give your best . i thought you were fighting for every point . was that important for you ? you were into it , setting the tone .
is that part of your strategy with what you 're dealing with , keeping points shorter ? you 're coming to the net more .
if you have to give from 1 to 10 how you played today , what would you give ?
would you say 11 ?
are you confident that you can make it through this tournament or you do n't know at this point ?
can you talk about the adjustments to your diet and how that 's helping you healthwise ?
what 's that ?
very creative .
wheatgrass ?
have you had to change the way in which you practice and prepare for a match ? do you find yourself hitting a limit maybe sooner than anticipated physically ?
are you planning on going to the fed cup ?
when you were diagnosed , did you consider retirement ?
like you had had enough ?
your dress also is very conservative , is it not ? for venus ?
it 's available everywhere ?
are you confident that you 'll receive any olympic berth ? there are people ranked ahead of you , you know .
have you looked forward into your next match coming up with petra ? if so , what kind of game plan are you looking at doing ? what kind of challenge will it be for you ?
your thoughts on adding mixed doubles to the olympics ?
you talked about having fun at fed cup , and sloane stephens was talking about how she became friendly with you and serena . can you talk about your relationship with her ?
so the first set you lose in a tiebreaker . what happened in that tiebreaker ? you rebounded quite nicely . what was the difference in the second and third set ?
is this your first time here ?
you get in for qualifying . obviously that 's a good thing , but does it help establish a rhythm once you get in , or is it more tiring ?
this being home , so to speak , what 's it like playing in south florida ? does it help you at all having the crowd behind you ?
whole family , being ...
your goal for this tournament ? how far do you think you can go ?
what are the challenges regarding the age restriction rules ? does that make it harder to keep momentum up ? i know you did well at the us open and indian wells . what are the challenges for you ?
will you play like one of the big wildcard playoffs for the us open ? you might get in directly .
i know that you know sloane stephens pretty well . talk about your relationship with her and what she 's like .
do you consider yourself the generation that can bring american women 's tennis back ? it 's obviously on a downslide .
how important is that to you ?
how has your game changed from when you first started ? i guess when you were 14 you turned pro .
how has your game changed and how have you changed as a person ?
you still take courses online ?
have you ever considered going to college ? did that ever go through your mind ?
also , the story i 've read it everywhere when you were four years old walking through your parents ' bedroom . am i right ?
what did her dress look like ?
and your mother or your father told you ?
what is it like for you to have a chance to play these players here near top 50 , have a chance testing yourself . you showed at the us open and here your ability to keep up with them .
you talk about practicing with sloane . do you try to practice with as many pros as you can , getting exposed to those highlevel players outside of these tournaments ?
when you do n't have anyone to hit with , who do you hit with ?
are you still playing junior tournaments ? are you mixing ? you did last year , right ?
what is the part of your game that you 're most confident about and what is part of your game that you 'd really like to improve the most ?
life , do you feel like a regular teenager or do you feel like a little bit older ? what do you do for fun around boca ?
what was your last movie ?
who is your favorite women 's player ? who do you look up to ?
looked like it took you a little time to get going out there . last two sets did n't look like the first set .
what are the challenges of playing ? you have n't played a lot of tournaments at all the last 12 months almost . what are the challenges of playing such a partial schedule and having to get yourself into the tournament ?
have you thought back to that match in australia at all , especially in the wake of what azarenka has been able to do has n't lost a match since winning the grand slam ? does it make you look back on that match ?
are you plan to go play in the fed cup in april ?
may i ask you why ?
you were saying you were playing freely during the match . do you miss those times ? because as a mother , sometimes thoughts just come to your mind . does it come to your mind during the matches ?
i notice you 're wearing a black ribbon today . can you talk about what that was for ?
judging by the way you ran down that nasty dropshot , is that saying your ankle is feeling better ?
you have had unfortunately a lot of ankle injuries before . where did this one rank in the ones you have had in the past ?
you had a lot of time to think about your tennis in your break from australia . have you decided any more about your schedule .
your body changed a little bit in the past year . are you doing any different type of fitness ? seems like maybe you change your diet a little bit .
do you try new recipes ?
the olympics is the only big goal now for you ? you did n't play 2008 , and i understand why you did n't play . but you also did n't play 2004 olympic games , right ? why you did n't play ?
tell us how well your ankle feels and where would you put it .
would you say 80 % , 90 % or so on a scale ?
congratulations .
this wraps up obviously a big year for you . how important was it for you to get it title and end it on a good note all the same ?
how close were you to not playing this tournament potentially ? i know you 've been sick for sometime between here in the us open .
why all the pressure ? why after the year that you 've had did you want to win this one so badly ?
you 've only lost one match since you lost at the french open . how much credit of that goes to your new partnership with patrick , or is there anything else that you 've done to change ? and just even bouncing back from that loss .
you started the week a little bit slow and you really did n't have your rhythm , even though you did n't drop a set , and today was pretty good overall . talk about the performance . she did n't have a break point ; you were hitting winners from everywhere .
talk about how you focus . you get out there in front of this crowd , it 's totally sold out , and people are yelling and screaming . are you in your zone and able to block everything out and focus on the ball ?
you played in so many grand slams and so many of these championships . what do you think about the quality of the women 's game now as compared to how it was perhaps when you ' first emerged as a player , the depth of quality in the women 's game ?
how do you rank this season in your career ?
when you look back after couple of years , what is the biggest thing you 're going to you remember about this tournament ?
yeah .
you said you knew you were a heavy favorite coming into this tournament . how heavy a favorite will you be at the australian open , do you think ?
have you got another serena slam in you ?
on monday on the media day , li na was speaking about you and she said that when serena is on her 100 % she 's impossible beat . do you feel invincible ? obviously she 's right .
patrick suggested that despite all you 've achieved in the game that you can still improve . do you agree with that ? if so , can you say how you go about it without giving away secrets ?
at the top of the game at the moment you have , as it were , two 31 year olds , roger federer and yourself . what do you think that says about the longevity of tennis ? if a young player is coming in now , they 're probably got a very long career ahead of them before they actually reach their ultimate .
could you ever imagine a time when you would n't want to be competitive and out there playing tennis ?
they announced the candidates for the 2014 locations for the tournament . how much of a priority do you think it should be for the wta to find somewhere that can kind of replicate this kind of environment , this sort of overflow crowds you get here , the enthusiasm , because it has n't always been that way .
start of the year you tore up your ankle in brisbane .
i know . thinking back to that and not sure if you could play the aussie , if you would 've know you would 've gotten to this point where you 're olympic gold and wimbledon , and us open champion , i guess you might have taken that , huh ?
so patrick says you 're going to be training in mauritius .
yeah , he does . that 's a change for you . no l.a. , no florida . he did n't talk that much .
but he said you were training in mauritius . for you to put yourself out there , staying in paris , going to mauritius , not doing the normal things , is it something you 're trying to do in your life to change things up and keep it fresh ?
i never seen you so fast to go to the net and play so much at the net .
the net , play so offensive all the time . do you think this is the evolution of yourself to play shorter points , always every match , and this is the best serena ?
the statistics are good .
is this the best serena in ' your mind ?
no , this one , this serena .
you 've been playing very hard , and then maybe after tomorrow back to your country . so what are you imagining in istanbul , the turkish people ?
you 're playing all the week . you 're playing hard .
no , no , playing all week here .
tomorrow it 's back to your country maybe after tomorrow .
no , what are your thoughts of istanbul ?
so for example , what are you doing tomorrow ?
i may be wrong , but at one point i hear you shouting in french , allez .
so you did n't shout allez in french today ?
anyway , i was told by patrick that you 're practicing in french , correct ?
you played pretty well overall but just could n't get a sniff on her serve seemed like . she had a big serving day once again .
do you expect with the amount of times you played her now that when she needs to she 's going to serve well in the clutch or come up with a big groundstroke at 30all or at deuce ?
you do n't have to keep moving at this moment . now you get some time off to reflect and rest . what do you look back on the 2012 season most having now wrapped it up ?
when you talk about moving in the right direction , does that count for this match ? your last two matches against her were not as close as this in the olympics final and madrid .
can you read her serve ? is her toss that hard to read , or do you feel like you have to kind of guess on her first serve ?
you 're the one that 's returning though .
$ 1 million . but seriously , can he see where her toss is going , or are you saying , she might go t this time , she might go out wide , but i 'm just going to have to guess .
so it 's hard to ?
after a couple of years when you look back and when you remember this tournament , what 's the biggest thing you will remember about this tournament ?
with the finals going to another place in 2014 , there is a lot of discussion about what the priorities should be for the wta . with how good the crowd is here , do you think finding somewhere where they can get sellout stadiums and this much enthusiasm for women 's tennis should be a priority ?
just on that point , do you like the idea of moving the championships every two or three years to places that do n't have bigtime tennis events ?
you were mentioning brazil and rio , which i guess is n't a candidate . would you like to see it put someplace like paris or london , putting l.a. aside ?
well rather than just saying , okay , we 'll have all these cities bid for it .
and maybe we should move it to a part of asia that has n't had a lot of exposure to tennis or ...
so when is the next time you plan on hitting a ball ?
they announced finalist cities for the next years and one is in russia . what would that mean to you to have it in kazan ?
could you sense how tired she was from pretty early on ?
what did you say to her after the match ? you had a nicelooking exchange .
there is something special between you and the fans here . what would you like to say about this ?
do you have any sort of preference at all for who you play in the final ? obviously you 've done well against both so i 'm assuming no . but do you ?
i 've noticed that you 've hardly grunted at all this whole tournament . sometimes you can a lot in matches , but i do n't think you have once here , if at all . is there something different in how you 're feeling on court that changes that , something you notice ?
so it 's a sign that you 're more comfortable that you 're not doing it now , do you think ?
obviously that looked like that win felt pretty good . as the second set is going your way and obviously after the match , it was clear that this win meant a lot to you .
yesterday you were saying you needed to be aggressively consistent . seemed like you pretty much executed , what 90 % , 95 % of the time what you wanted to do ?
just talk a little bit about fitness overall . clearly you look more fresh than she did today ; was n't moving that well . i guess fitness really matters in those kind of tournaments when it 's condensed , six days , and being in shape enough to play day after day means something .
do you think it 'll be a pg13 final ?
the tour pretty much stops for two months after this tournament before australia . this is the tournament you look back to as having been your most recent match for a while . how important that was in terms of ending on the right note against azarenka after all the matches you played this year ?
what will be on your mind then ?
you seem to do a good job of convincing yourself , even after taking a series of defeats like you did to victoria that you can actually go out and do it which you managed to do today . so against serena you said you have n't beaten her in a long time . you still believe if you execute you can win the match ?
do you think about choosing less tournaments next year ?
do you think about playing less tournaments next year ?
yeah .
is there a greater sense of satisfaction as the years go by that you are still capable of playing the level of tennis that you 're playing and being in a final of this merit tomorrow ?
putting aside tomorrow 's match , after this entire year up to today , is it fair to say that you are better now than you were in 2008 ?
how tired were you out there today , and when did it really start to hit you ?
with your game you need to be able to move well to have chance against someone like serena , do n't you ?
what did she say to you afterwards at the net ?
looking back on the year , starting the year ranked outside of the top 5 and now inside the top 5 , a chance at no.1 , did you believe that you could be this high ranked at the beginning of the year ?
what did you prove to yourself this year that you maybe did n't realize about yourself as a player ?
how does the australian open suit you as a grand slam as the next one ?
your father was here for the week . was he here to help coach or just for support ?
and vacation plans ?
do you know where you 're going yet for vacation ?
first of all , can we know where you 're going ?
can you say us ? can you tell us ?
secondly , do you think it was unfair that she had a day off yesterday just before the semifinals ?
when you seen an opponent struggling like that in the first set , what do you think ?
kind of funky playing those dead rubber matches , no ?
you know what i mean . you 're getting through anyway and she ca n't .
but is it just a little bit of an upgrade on a practice match ? are you kind of thinking ahead ? you knew going into today that you 'd reached the semifinals and she could n't get there , so it 's not really same type of pressure or intensity .
next you get the winner of the match coming up later tonight between li na and azarenka . can you talk about each them , especially i guess li na , because you 've played azarenka a lot recently .
when you lose several times to the same player , like azarenka , do you ever go back and watch those matches ?
any main things you see when you watch them ?
you said about the australian open prize money that you did n't think it would be a good idea to increase the first round loser 's prize money . what do you think about the case of injured players who come back after and they 're struggling at first because they have no support from federation or maybe do n't have sponsors as well ? so the first round loser 's paycheck is very important to these kind of players , do n't you think ?
just talk a little bit more about playing victoria if you play her . you 've played her a lot this year . you beat her in stuttgart ; very close at the us open ; other ones , not so close . what do you need to do to get over the hump on hard courts ?
is there a mental part of it confidencewise against her , because she seems to return you very well also ?
just one more on stosur . since she won the us open she sort of struggled to replicate that fantastic match she played against serena . have you noticed a change in her game or herself since then ?
you were the first top player li na was trying to challenge when she came back from her retirement back in 2005 .
li na .
she has for two years .
you played her in 2005 australian open that year .
third round . you beat her pretty bad .
you do n't remember ?
yeah .
after so many meetings in seven years , do you think in a way that she 's still fresh as she was back then considering she 's almost 31 years old right now ? can you talk about that ?
i remember when you beat victoria this year in the stuttgart final and afterwards you got a car and you drove the car onto the court . have you had a chance to drive that car much yet ?
no ?
did you see the video you were in with robson and bouchard ?
reaction ? looked kind of fun there , huh ?
did they ask you to dance ?
what 's your overall feeling at the moment ? relief ? exhaustion ? excited to make the semis ?
in the second set she had that really long game to hold to 54. i think you had four break points , and then you came off your chair and you just ran through the next three games . talk about what were you thinking on the changeover , and how did you ever manage to do that ?
you had n't had too many problems against her before and beat her i think easily in madrid . were you surprised at her level tonight ?
you had very long games in this tournament . do you think it 's going to be a problem tomorrow ?
when you look back at the wimbledon final , what 's the general emotion that you have ? what 's the thing that you remember , that sticks with you ?
at the end of the first set after that long 34shot rally and you missed the backhand on set point and you threw your racquet , have you ever broken a racquet before other than that one time at the australian open ?
the crowd were fantastic today , if you would agree . did they help you in this win ?
the crowd , the supporters , did they help you in this win ?
the fans , did they help you ?
two things : the wimbledon final , did you take out of it , even though you lost , that , yes , you can play with her and beat her on a good day ? and number two , on this surface here you 've never played her on hard court is that more of an advantage to you ?
errani hits a very different ball from both sides . the forehand have more topspin and the backhand is more direct . is it tough to adjust to these kinds if differences ?
you got off to a pretty good start in this match and then it seemed to turn near the end of the first set for a while . something changed in your game you think , or what happened ?
with carlos , have you guys already talked and confirmed that he 'll continue to work with you next year , or will you talk about that in the offseason ?
so you have n't confirmed that you 'll still work with him next year , or you will ?
after her last match last night , angelique kerber and her coach and team all jumped in the pool at the hotel in the middle of the night and it was freezing cold . are you going to do anything to celebrate your season being over ?
do you know what your vacation plans are , where you 're going ?
are you going to tell us ?
and do you know if you 're planning to do your training for the preseason in beijing or back in europe ? you do n't want to talk about it yet ?
longest wta game ever . how do you feel now ? it took three hours and a half .
emotionally ? physically ?
between the second and the third set you lost few games in a row , six or five , i guess , and then you managed to come back to the game . how did you do it ? it looked like you were out of power totally , completely , and then suddenly turning point and you began to play very , very well in the third set .
this was a very long match and you proved during this whole match that you deserve for being in this masters . did you learn a lot ? what did you learn exactly during these few matches ? did it show you that you really belong to the top now ?
what i meant is angelique kerber was in her first master and she was a little bit intimidated for a first match , but after she learned a lot . my question was : do you feel the same or not ?
did you enjoy playing on that surface here in istanbul ?
it 's been is fantastic year for you , 2012 : your first grand slam title ; winning olympic gold in doubles ; bronze in singles ; and now yearend no.1 .
can you talk about which part of your game you did better than li na today ?
yeah . and what made the difference for both of you ?
this is the first time i think all year that the wta top 4 have all made the semifinals of an event . seems like you four have really been consistent this year in the way the wta has n't had in a few years . what do you think has caused this stability at the top with you at the top of that ?
there is always debates about scheduling at so many tournaments , but do you think at something like the championships it 's right that three of you should have to play today and one player gets a day 's rest before such an important semifinal and final ? perhaps we could look at it a little bit better the way it 's planned in future years ?
i know you want to stay in the moment and you got a big match coming up , but i think there has only been 11 yearend no.1s in 37 years . there 's been others that have done it during the year , but that 's not that many players . so talk about the achievement , because you have your name amongst some pretty good people now .
moving to tomorrow , everyone says every match is a new match . when you play someone six times in a year i think that 's going to be your sixth match against maria is it sort of a continuation in a way ? you just played a few weeks ago ; you played at the us open ; you played during the summer . is it all fresh , or it is a continuum ?
you did some unusual double faults in this tournament .
really ? i was going to ask if you have any problem with lights or something like that ?
congratulations .
in men 's tennis sampras was six times no.1 at the end of the year ; federer , similar story . in women 's tennis , recently every year more or less it 's changing .
do you see that as good , or would it be better to have someone steady , consistently no.1 for the image of tennis , or every year you change ?
i do n't know . i 'm asking you , because they 're more interested in what you 're saying than what i 'm saying .
do you think it 's probable , easy to happen , or very easy ...
or not easy , but ...
we always see you with your headphone before your match . what do you listen ? which song do you listen to before your match ?
yeah , maybe .
which music do you like ? which kind ?
she 's a very good player , but you just seem to have her number and win the big points when you need to . talk a little bit about the match and coming back in the second .
seemed like there were a lot of momentum swings in this match , even within games . a lot of games started one way and went another . how easy was it for you to sort of get a rhythm in this match ?
in some ways you were saying coming in here you were practicing , you were sick of practice , but you had n't played in five weeks . maybe expecting to play really well off the bat was a little unreasonable and you 're now in the groove three matches in ?
long layoff , and now you 've played three matches and you 'll get a day off . looking forward to the day off or still ready to go ?
just breaking down the matchup against her , you 've lost to her once and you 've beaten her five times this year . the us open match was super close , but what do you think the little or medium size or big difference is that gets you the wins every time ?
seems like given your record against her and maria that you do n't mind playing the hard , flat hitters , that you kind of invite the matchup .
i saw when you were coming on the courts a nice picture of you with the gold medalist serena williams on your bag . is that luck for you ?
olympic gold medalist serena williams .
on your sport bag .
last night i was watching you on tv and you were saying you love it here and you would like to move to istanbul . how serious were you ?
last night in the tv interview you said you loved istanbul and you would consider about moving here to istanbul . how serious were you ?
the last championships you played was in doha , and then this is your first time in istanbul . can you compare the two cities , the two hosts ?
how much are you looking forward to monday and vacation ?
in some ways too i would think given how well you 've done the last six or seven months that you have the feeling i do n't want season to end ; i just keep winning and winning .
you likely play radwanska in the semifinals the way things are shaking out now . you guys have n't played since that wimbledon final , which was pretty up and down . talk about the players that play with spin and stuff . talk about that matchup and the challenges she presents .
is it hard to come in sort of late to a tournament and everyone else has played and you finally get a crack at it ?
given that you were sort of behind the eight ball , did that sort of change your motivation or approach at all ?
you found a good sort of patch in the second set and could n't hold onto it , i suppose .
one more match . are you almost sort of happy the year will be over , or how are you looking at it ?
how will you look back on the ' season overall , do you think ?
what specifics have you improved in ?
any plans after tomorrow night ?
last year you were in the limelight after winning us open and making semis here . you were one of the favorites in aussie open , and obviously you want to do very well in your home slam .
but it was , as we know , kind of a disaster .
now you 're a little bit maybe going to the aussie open under the radar . do you think it 'll be better this time around ?
how much of a part did the court play ? you could n't execute your kick serve as much as you would maybe like .
yeah .
just so follow up , last one on the australian open . marinko is going to be the australian no.1 . does that surprise you ?
how would you summarize your first championships ?
looking back on your season , what 's the thing that you 're the most proud of ? the ranking ? the wins ? the semifinal ?
when the first set was over and you lost it , that meant that you were out of the tournament . how did you feel after that first set , and what it the reason you were not so effective in the second set ?
your first win ever at this tournament , this wta championships , and it ended with a bagel . how does that feel for you ?
a lot of players talk about how it 's a big honor just to make it to this tournament . obviously it 's a much bigger deal once you win here . does it feel different now , more like you belong now that you 're winning matches ?
can you just talk about playing radwanska . does n't completely play your style , but you 're both fast . it 's a little bit different than just playing on the normal power players , no ?
how would you characterize the match ? some lost opportunities there . up 30 in the second , and she came back in and fought and got through in the end .
was that just mostly execution or a little bit of nerves ? the occasion ?
obviously you struggled a lot with your second serve today . is there something in this shot that you can identify that you think was going wrong or something you need to look at with your coach you think ?
obviously you 're disappointed , but you have to be somewhat confident coming out of that that you did n't play your best but you did have quite a few opportunities there .
how difficult was it to kind of come down from yesterday 's long , long match and recover for this one ?
what is more important for you : finishing the tournament by being champion or finishing the year in the top place ?
she 's clearly the player that gives you the most trouble and maria the most trouble . when you go out there against her , thing are n't going well , does it feel inevitable that things are going to slip away from you ?
not controversy .
what i 'm saying is with you and maria both when you guys play your best , it looks like you 're right there with serena , can beat serena , but usually , at least over the last few years , she 's coming out on top . what i want you to do is kind of identify the reason .
tomorrow is going to win stay , lose go home for both you and li na . what are your thoughts about the match ?
so compare with the match you beat her last year at the same stadium , do you see any difference in her game compared to last year ?
obviously the round robin tournament format here is really unique on the whole calendar . now that you 're in this winorgohome situation , it 's almost like it 's a quarterfinal for the tournament almost , and if you win that match you get to the semis , win that match you get to the final . does that make the rest of the tournament simpler for you mentally ?
unlike the olympics , you could get to play the same opponent in the final here the way it works . is there any one thing you can identify that you know already you want to do differently the next time you play serena either here or whenever it is ?
chancing gears a little bit , once again , another great crowd out there . the wta is looking to find a new host for the championships . for you personally , would you rather see it in a city like a madrid or los angeles or something like that , a big city , urban area , but maybe the crowds are a little bit smaller , maybe a little bit less enthusiastic , or something kind of like this ? obviously istanbul has a lot to offer , but you get this sort of energetic crowd .
you were talking about the crowd , but what do you think about the music on the changeovers here ?
yeah .
strange match , because normally you win a lot of points on your serve , you lose sometimes the point on your return . today the opposite . i never seen you losing twice a love game when you were serving for the set . how do you explain it ?
do you think she has a very good return also ? it 's only your serve ?
do you have any explanation for these troubles today ?
serena , in some ways , though , it 's not such a bad thing winning a match against a very good player when you 're not serving well .
so the early frustration with the racquet , you do n't break too many in matches .
you sort of knew early on things were n't going well . did you anticipate you would be fighting yourself the whole night ?
why do you think li na knew is always a tough player it play ? you guys play a couple of tiebreaks almost every match you apply against her .
can you talk about the difference you feel about her as a player before her winning the grand slam last year ? at that time you were not playing at all , so you are the perfect player to talk about how different is she before her winning and right now .
you seemed quite emotional on the court the last few days ; is that a fair comment ? is there any particular reason for it ?
you said you 've been in europe a long time the other day . how long ?
weeks ?
happy birthday , by the way .
that 's a while .
because why ? you wanted to work out with patrick ?
it 's sort of a change of pace for you to come over to europe in the fall and practice . first time really , no ?
your mom is here and patrick is here and sasha is here , and they all have roles in your life . who is coaching what percentage and how does that work out ? do you get overwhelmed sometimes with the three of them all talking to you at the same time ?
you 're next match here is against victoria , which is the match that everybody started talking about when the groups were made here for this tournament . the stakes are a little different in this sort of situation , because you both could be already qualified for the semis before that match even starts . how does that sort of make this match different ? how important is it for you to do well and win that match ?
why do you think the matchup has been good for you against her in the past ?
you mentioned the word `` change '' and how coming to europe was a bit of a change . seems like this year there are a lot of changes that you made . you 've played a fuller schedule ; you stayed in paris to train after the french . talk about that a little bit , the motivation to shake things up , i guess .
can i just try to understand a little bit more about the match of today . again on the serve you hit 51 % of serves in , okay ? you made the same sort of points with the second serve than with the first . you served 51 % on first serve and 51 % of second serve . you made exactly the same sort of points . how do you explain it ? whether you served first or second , she returns the same or does n't make any difference ? should have made a difference .
you made 20 points out of 39 on first and 21 out of 41 on the second .
so it 's same percentage .
it 's strange , because normally if you put the first serve in you should make many more points .
obviously this was a late finish for you . what was it like fighting out there ? talk about the match .
you seemed to be disagreeing with your coach at points during the match . was that tactics from before the match or when he visited you ?
did you feel like at any time you were playing the match on your terms , or was that not until the very end of the match ?
so do you feel only happiness or is it more just relief that you got through it and a little bit of frustration trying to move on to get the level you want ?
absolutely . in the middle of the third set , i heard an impression that you shouted to radwanska , run run . was i mistaken , or it was your plan to force her to run ?
it was quite a strange match to watch with so many service breaks and everything . how did it feel out there playing it ?
you had similar scorelines in the past with her , very tight sets . how do you explain it ? what do you like to make a difference , because the level is similar but you 're not far from her ?
the last time you played her was two years ago . did you notice some differences in her game from the last time ?
did you notice some differences in her game since the last time you played her ?
yeah . so you do n't remember ?
i think it was two years ago .
in which way do you think you are changing , because you did something different tonight , in my opinion ? maybe about the new coach ? maybe you are trying to do something different ?
i say i see the difference .
so i ask you in which way do you think you were changing your game ?
i see more henin style , very fast movement from one side to another side .
no movement with legs , but with arms and the ball is moving faster , in my opinion . you just go on the other side . what do you think ? i am wrong ?
it seemed like for most of the beginning of the year sometimes when people asked you questions about the future you were like , i do n't know how many more years i 'm going to play and sounding a little bit down on yourself . seems like you have a little bit more energy maybe now and you 're talking about if you 're healthy , two , three more years . has your mentality changed about your future ?
when you returned back to beijing and played a couple weeks ago ...
how have you seen a difference in the fans in their knowledge and experience with tennis compared to like the olympics back in 2008 ? seems like they are more knowledgeable now , no ?
what 's the best way to play against serena ? is it to try and make the first strike in the rally and keep her under pressure and deny her time ? if so , do you feel you were hitting the ball well ?
were you encouraged when she smashed her racquet ?
at 31 when she did the two double faults .
how many racquets have you smashed in the locker room ?
that was a great match ; lasted over three hours . what are your thoughts after that ?
you had the two match points in the second set , so back to that . do you wish you played those points better or was that just vika stepping up ?
how much are you able to appreciate the quality of a match while it 's going on ?
this is your first time at the championships . what are some of the things you learned here ?
after three hours running on the court , how was your body reaction ? do you think you 're going to run another three hours tomorrow to play against li na maybe ?
you beat li na in indian wells . it was a great defense , at least to me , but she managed to get revenge in cincinnati final . what do you think maybe you will play different compared to that match back in cincinnati ?
you said , now i know that i can play with these players , that i belong with the top players . you did n't believe it before ?
when you 're playing a match like that , can you enjoy it in the moment when you 're playing , or is it not until maybe after the match that you look back and say , oh , that was fun ?
57 main draw wins in your first six professional years in total , and this year 60. what can you say about that ?
have you played in a better match that you can remember ?
yeah .
there were kind of so many ups and downs , but the two shots you played at match point down , i mean , they were pretty special , were n't they , in terms of quality of shot and choosing to play those two shots when you had to play them ?
everyone was getting very excited and they were on twitter about the match . they were having some comparison with your comeback with djokovic , it was a djokovic comeback because you were hitting winner left and right . what do you think about this comparison ?
a lot of people were comparing this as one of the best matches of the year with the scoreline and the intensity and the crowd and everything . you also seemed sort of frustrated with some of your tennis at certain points . how do you come down on how good this match was and how good you played ?
how satisfying is it for you to play in this sort of tournament , this highstakes , topeight tournament with a crowd that 's that 's loud and involved in the match the whole way ?
what is more satisfying for you : this win or this award ?
do you think to have survived a match like that shows how far you 've come physically , emotionally , mentally in the last 18 months ?
you lost your first set since the final in us open after 26 straight sets . did it feel strange or different ?
is it somehow very special that tomorrow obviously you 're playing serena , a win for you will guarantee a no.1 ranking and obviously she the player of the second half of the year . does that make it a very special occasion for you and in a sense one that 's easier to get up for rather than playing someone else ?
you talked about having to go for your shots when you were match point down . is that something that you 've always kind of mentally been able to do , or is that something that 's evolved over time , having that courage and knowing you ca n't leave it on the court , you 've got to go for it ?
and then just talking about crowd , which a lot of the players have been extremely complimentary about , what 's so unique about the crowd at the championships in istanbul as opposed to stanford or toronto or something like that ?
i was curious about something you said earlier comparing getting this award to being fined for skipping a press conference . you seem a lot more comfortable behind the microphone now .
is that all it is , more time up there , or have you been working on things to get better at this ?
it sounds strange to us , because as media we consider a lot ourself sometimes . it 's about one week we are talking about you with the possibility to win two matches and become no.1 of the world at the end of the year for sure . you say just before that you did n't know it . i mean , you do n't read about the stats , the fact that if you beat serena tomorrow you 'll be definitely no.1 ? you said you did n't know it . i mean , it 's strange to us . we have been writing every day about this .
it 's been a while since you played . just talk about how you felt it went , whether you had rhythm .
are you okay physically ? do you feel you 're moving all right ? body responding to what you want it to do ?
you lost to her last time you played in cincinnati . you seem to have a pretty good record in your career of avenging losses . is that something that can motivate you on court ?
you were not here last year . how do you find the grounds , atmosphere , and the supporters ?
we saw you quite emotional out there , kind of fist pumping and screaming . was that intensity ? nerves ? what were you going through emotionally on court today ?
how much do you care about finishing no.1 as opposed to winning majors ?
obviously you had a great summer , but you have n't played since the us open final . coming out tonight , were you wondering , how am i going to hold up ? am i going to be able to play as well ? am i going to be rusty ?
did you follow the lance armstrong stuff at all ?
yeah .
not really about the specifics , but you 're aware of who he was .
so for something like that to happen to a legend where all of his titles are gone and his reputation is trashed , just your reactions to that .
he never tested positive but the government found him guilty and striped him of his titles , yeah .
do you feel testing in tennis you talked about this before do you feel it 's stringent enough ?
kerber 's coach said it was very high level for first match , and he said for kerber it was new experience and she was really excited and felt it at the end . do you remember yourself for your first experience for your first master ? how did you feel during your first master , and were you as excited as she was ?
and about your first experience in a masters , do you remember it ?
you told us that it 's your first time here . how will you spend your free time in istanbul , and what are going to be the souvenirs you will take home ?
after the tournament .
talk a little bit about what the wta was like for you in terms scheduling and commitments and tournaments before 2009 and the roadmap and how it differs from how it is now ?
some of the younger players have been a bit more vocal about wanting more flexibility sometimes with the tournaments . they i feel like it 's a little bit constricting in what tournaments they can or ca n't play . what 's your response to that , or do you feel the same way ?
on a very small organizational point , the in the men 's championships they play on alternate days . you 've had to play today and tomorrow . do you think it would be more sensible if you played it group by group so you 're all playing on the same day ?
i think after this you go to africa ; is that right ?
talk about your plans for your offseason schedule and how rest for next season works into that ?
you going to play against li na tomorrow . what would you like to say about this game ?
you arrived here i think earlier than a lot of the other players and you looked quite comfortable out there on court .
how is the court playing ? what 's your sense of it ?
we 've talked about your slow hard court or slow court play a lot this year , but it seems like you 've adjusted well . you do n't mind dealing with her high balls , you seemed to be getting on top of pretty much everything she was giving you ?
did you have any time after the us open to work on your game practicewise and try some new things , or do you pretty much day , okay we 're still in the season ; ca n't try anything radical ; i 'm just going to get to the end and maybe work on some things after the championships ?
i believe you hit 22 winners with your forehand today . is that about as good as you 've felt on any one stroke ever ?
what would you like to say about the atmosphere ? seems like you have a great fan base here in turkey .
you obviously broke through first at wimbledon winning there on a pretty fast surface ; more recently in your career big results have come for you on slower courts , especially on clay . do you think you 've sort of evolved into a different sort of player over the years where this is now a better environment for you maybe than the reverse , younger ?
did you follow the lance armstrong stuff ?
were you shocked ? big cultural icon like that .
sort of brings up the question as to whether or not doping is stringent enough in all sports . do you think the controls are enough in tennis ?
are they enough , yeah .
but you 're okay with the whereabouts rule in general ?
is there any chance in the future we might see the sugarpova candies in turkey ?
that was your first win over petra this career . what was the difference today ?
this is a round robin format where if you lose you can still keep going in the tournament . how important is it still to win your first match here and get the week off to a good start ?
you talked about having to make adjustments and change different surfaces and all that . how is the court playing ? is it quick ? slow ?
what is your first impression about the atmosphere here ?
i know it 's been a long year , but where is your motivation level to come through and win the tournament ?
so because it 's just the eight of you and you 're the eight best players this year , do you say to yourself , this year i want to show my best tennis because this is the best group ?
you 've been on tour from before the wta roadmap was put into place obviously to now . can you talk a little bit about how different it feels now that the roadmap is in place for two , three years , kind of the difference in commitment to tournaments , the pressure to play ? is it better ? worse ?
how do you rank the importance of this tournament in comparison to grand slams and olympics and stuff like that ?
you are playing against maria sharapova tomorrow . what would you like to say about this game ?
you said you already know what your schedule is going to look like next year . would you want more flexibility in choosing where to play ?
did you think she played very nervous today ?
so when you play someone like her or sharapova , do you say to yourself , first i 'm going to see if they 're on and i 'll play consistent , or i know they 're great players and i have to push myself more and not just play consistent ?
back at wimbledon , you said that you felt nervous coming out there as a defending champion . today did you feel kind of the same feeling of just nerves ?
i know you 're defending champion , but you 've played here before , you played her before , so why so nervous ?
so when you asked your coach to come on court towards the end of the second set , what did you ask him to help you with and what did he say ?
as defending champion , you have great memories from last year . what 's your first impression about the tournament , about the atmosphere ?
you 've had a lot tough losses and things like that . i 've never seen you this kind of torn up about a loss before . what makes this one more emotional for you ?
as courtney said , you 've been through losses and wins when you 've been nervous . what did you tell yourself today to try and calm down ? why do you think it did n't work ?
when you got off court and you went into the locker room did you feel more angry or sad ?
did you break any racquets ?
you talked yesterday about how you like playing on faster courts . today aga said this is one of the slower hard courts she 's played on . do you agree it 's playing slow , slower than last year ?
you do n't have a game tomorrow . how will this plan your day ?
are you confident that you can get your game back and win another maybe two matches and get to the semifinals ? do you feel you have that in you ?
you 've never been in a tournament , i do n't think , where you 've lost a match and get to keep going . last year you went undefeated here . how is this going to be different for you convincing yourself to get ready to play again after a loss ?
were you surprised by any element of agnieszka radwanska 's game ?
your coach said something like you might feel more relaxed just because you have the privilege of having made it to this tournament already and that that 's a big accomplishment . do you feel that way on court , that everything was easier because you already have this big thing of being here ?
speaking about that , that you 're still here tomorrow , which format do you prefer : round robin or regular , standard format ?
so you do like round robin then ?
you had beaten serena the last time you two played in cincinnati . how do you think that changes your next match , both from your side obviously having confidence of having beaten her , but also from her side knowing she 's playing someone that has beaten her and maybe it changes her attitude a little bit ?
do you think that last match in cincinnati affected today ?
it looked like you had done everything , the winners , dictated the game , and still you have lost . how frustrating is it ?
you want to talk about the last game ? you were serving from behind the whole third set . that 's tough anyway just trying to hold . what are you feeling going out there at 45 ?
starting out up 3love , you were confident at that point . what happened at that moment after you were down 31 and then you were up 41 ?
what 's the toughest thing in your game , in her game , when you 're facing her ? what 's the toughest thing for you when you 're playing azarenka ?
it 's not like she 's bombing serves like serena , and i know she 's consistent with her first serve , but were you just not getting a good hit on the ball or tougher to read ?
was there any moment you thought about your third set record this year ?
how different a player is she on hard court versus on other surfaces ?
you have been off court for just a little bit , but the slam season is now over for you . you had some fabulous results . could you just talk about your year , particularly in the slams , and , well , overall , what it 's meant for you , including flag bearer ?
if you had to grade yourself on this , the way you have played at this tournament given what you know you can do and how you felt match after match , where would you put yourself ?
did you go out there feeling like top of your game , everything was working well , or was it a struggle for you ?
given that serena , as you can tell , is dominating right now against errani it 's 51 assuming she does play vika in the final , is there anything anybody really can do against serena when she 's playing the dominating tennis she 's playing right now ? what does vika have to do ?
you seemed to obviously want this win , no question . you were demonstrative about it . is there anything about this title that really made it more important to you ?
are you going to stick around for fashion week or do you head home or what do you do ?
what flavor ?
so do you say to yourself , i 'm happy i played victoria much closer than i did at australia and indian wells and i came close to beating her , or do you say , big missed opportunity ; i should have won that match ?
with everything you have gone through , how gratifying is it for you to be now consistently in the hunt for big titles and to feel you 're in that battle and in that game all the way to the end ?
jimmy connors was saying last week that no matter what you do after you 're done playing , nothing is going to be like being out there in front of 25,000 people showcasing your talent .
is it also controlling your own destiny , where you say instead of somebody else choosing you for that magazine cover , you 're making it happen on the tennis court ?
our sport is built around these great slams with their center courts . you talked about the thrill of being out there . of the four center courts in the slams , what has the most meaning ? what gives you the biggest charge ? what do you love the most ?
tennis thrives on rivalries . how would you describe the state of your rivalry with vika and where it might go ?
how do you get over this kind of loss ? do you have a special routine ?
did you feel you were out of your league today playing serena today ? that the gap of talent was just incredible today .
we use a term , out of our league , that she was at a different level of talent because of her game today . did you feel a little intimidated being on the tennis court the way she was playing ?
was there anything you could do today tacticswise to try to get into the match ?
when she 's at her best , can anybody beat her ?
what do you think about the final ? is serena the clear winner ?
well , how do you feel ? we 're getting to the moment of truth . any butterflies in the stomach ?
what were you thinking after the first set ?
were you thinking , oh , i have to turn this around ?
were you watching serena 's match ?
maybe serena is winning . could you talk about the match ?
why is she so difficult for you ?
do you go out on court with confidence against her ? because , you know , game to game it seems like you should play her a lot closer than you have the last two years .
what will you have to do well , do you think ?
maria said earlier today that she thought the big difference was that she could n't get the ball back and in often enough on your serve ; your serve was very effective against her in the third set . do you agree with that ?
how much do you enjoy playing against maria ? do you enjoy the challenge of facing her ?
is there a psychological factor tomorrow that you 're going to have to shut the crowd out ? because it is the us open , and given the decrepit state of american tennis , i assume the crowd will be cheering her on as line the lone face of american tennis at this point . is that something you can put the ear plugs in and just do what you have to do tomorrow ?
you seem to be having a lot of fun here . you 're dancing ; you have interesting people in your box ; you 're vivacious . has it been as much fun as it appears to us ?
does that still go back to that conversation you had with i think your grandmother ? is that still in your mind , that turnaround that you had ?
you play with that fabulous intensity out there , which is a huge asset .
but the crowd maybe does n't always warm up to you tremendously . we 're here in the media capital . what can you tell fans about victoria , the young person as a person ?
and off the court you 're calm and normal and laid back and all that ?
has it been a process trying to find a balance between having fun and being in tennis ? like at one point were you too much one or the other and you 're sort of reaching that point , or have you always been able to balance ?
was it feeling different after this match point compared to australia and the semifinal ? can you compare reaching your first final in melbourne and here ?
did you watch the stosur final last year when she was in a similar position to you , a massive underdog against serena , and she managed to produce the best tennis and get serena off her game ? did you watch that match ?
do you go back through the archives though and look at any video footage of yourself against serena in the next 24 hours ?
it looks like the lessons on the shuffle have paid off . was he happy with your style out there ?
given how well you 've played this year at various times and in big matches , i would think tomorrow night going on court you at least want to be competitive ; you do n't want to walk off getting blown out .
you can answer it , though .
when you have such a record against a player and someone like serena , do you have to avoid the temptation of saying , i 've got to change something and say , i 've got to just be who i am and do what i do and trust that ? is it difficult to not fall into the idea of how to do something different ?
could you go back to the grandmother issue and talk about her a little bit ? is she still working hard ...
so if she were hot and living the good life before maybe her advice might not have had the impact that it did .
can you tell us her name ?
the other day you talked about the importance of your coach . now could you talk about the manager , how important it is for you to have a manager who knows about tennis well and very close to you ?
you talk about your grandmother a lot . how much do you talk to your parents about career and how much is it just , you know , kind of personal on how you 're doing , that type of thing ?
yeah . like after a big win or a big loss do you go to mom or dad or whatever ?
have you thought about flying them in to new york or australia or another slam just so they could see you in person , or would it make you too nervous to have them in your box ?
sure . well , they 're too far away , but a couple days ago when you were getting into the semifinals maybe .
you had a long time to think about 4love .
how did you get through all that ?
the third set was pretty highquality stuff , was n't it ?
she 's a little unpredictable as to when she 's going to be hitting the lines and when she 's not . just talk about contending with that .
so you have n't lost a threeset match since pennetta last year . that 's a lot of them to win in a row . do you feel like going into those three sets , okay , i have done well all year ; i think i can pull it out again ?
rain has become such a regular feature here . there has obviously been a lot of talk of putting on a roof . talk about what yesterday was like , going out and having to come back on again and off , and then finally when they gave you the word you were playing the next day ?
today ?
was it kind of like a reboot , though ?
already tired when you get out there .
how would you describe you and victoria as competitors and then your respective styles of play ?
you talked after the match on court about how you wanted to exact your revenge for her victory . was there any extra motivation there ?
what are the keys when the two of you have been playing and what have been the keys in the rivalry ?
yeah . i mean , when you 've been successful , what has determined that for you ? and by contrast , when she 's been successful , what has been the difference ?
seems like you had the crowd support here in these big matches on ashe , petrova and against bartoli , as well . azarenka is someone who almost never has the crowd on her side when she 's playing . do you have any idea what makes a crowd what makes certain players more popular to crowds than others ?
the crowd is always for you , which is cool . today do you think they may have been for you because they were pulling for the one who was struggling coming from behind ? if so , how much did that help you ?
you and andy grew up together in florida . when he walked by , did you see him today ? any words exchanged ? andy roddick .
i know . but he wins the eddie herr , you win the eddie herr .
yeah , it was . the same sunday . you were 12 and he was 17 or so .
the third set , you know , you got the break early . in such a close match , how frustrating was it for you when you lost the break ?
serena williams obviously plays on the other half of the draw . when you think of her serve , what to you impresses you most or do you think makes her serve as successful as it is ?
how much of her success do you think depends on the success with the serve ?
do you think it 's pretty natural that the younger players go after the established grand slam champions and get a little more motivated ? do you think that was the case with victoria when she first started playing you back a few years ago and even today ? meaning you 're the hunted one more .
when you first played her , i think it was in moscow and it was close . i think it was moscow ...
victoria .
first couple times did you know she was going to be a really good player ?
you played errani in the french open final . now she 's made another semifinal ; doubles no.1 next week . what do you think she 's doing so well ?
back to serena , am i wrong in thinking that both the williams love power ? they seem to want their opponent to bang it with them . even when hingis was younger , when she was playing , she mixed it up a lot with them . i do n't think they like that . is that correct , or what 's your thoughts on that ?
i know you would n't want to change your game , that 's for sure .
first of all , congratulations on the win . playing obviously an opponent that you know very well and had a little extra time to really anticipate this match with the rain and so forth yesterday , talk about what it was like for the two of you to be out there playing and how you feel about the way you prevailed .
you 've played so well at the grand slams this year . congratulations on no.1 position in the doubles .
would you consider this a breakout year for you ? breakout year , meaning , your level has just come up so high this year . talk about the year in general .
you have done many things this year , top 10 , doubles no.1 . what are you proudest of ?
what are you most happy about ?
i know you said confidence and your racquet . what else do you think you 're doing so well ?
have do you worked at all this year with dr.lewis garcia del moral ?
so now that the itf have sort of warned players against working with him , will you not see him again ?
talk about playing either ana ivanovic or serena williams in the semifinal .
how confident are you that you could win this tournament ?
even when you 're two matches away ?
do you miss the days when you did n't have to do so much media ?
you put up a great fight out there today . came up short in the end . how do you feel about the match ?
was that some of your best tennis of the year , you think ?
what 's your relationship with that stadium out there ? are you building a love a affair for it ?
what are your impressions of the fight and determination of victoria ?
how did you actually fall into working into the match ?
did you think perhaps you had her ? she lost the challenge and then went on to break her . i think it was 44 at that point . did you think , maybe i have this after all ?
you did something here in the final last year that not too many people have been able to do lately : beat serena williams . she 's on a good roll . what are your impressions of the possibility somebody can beat serena williams here this year ?
your play in the last two sets , is that the equal of the way you played against serena last year ?
do you remember her only ace of the match ?
does the result give you confidence that you eventually will get a win over victoria ?
effectively does it further reinforce in your mind that you can be a contender again in the next couple of years ?
the standard and level of play was just so high in the match . do you allow yourself to get involved in that situation , or are you just so focused that you ca n't think of anything else ?
did you hear the crowd ? were you able to hear the aussie , aussie , aussie chants ?
those squash shots really took the crowd 's breath away , too . they were pretty impressive today .
serena obviously has an aura being serena , but also coming off what she 's done at wimbledon and the olympics . you obviously have cracked that aura last year . is it tough to mentally get to a place , is she just another player , or mentally is it sort of a walk you have to go through to realize you can take her down ?
is she the pick here to go on and win now ?
kim said earlier in the tournament that she thought that serena was the greatest player ever . what are your thoughts on serena 's place in history when she 's playing as well as she is now and with the future ahead of her ?
what 's the plan for you now , immediately next week or two ?
regarding serena , what about her serve makes it so difficult ?
this match came down to 55 in the tiebreaker . i missed the top of this , so pardon me if you alluded to this already . can you take us from 55 in the tiebreaker to the last two points ?
how would you describe your fire to win this tournament right now ?
sam said that she played her best tennis of the tournament today but it was n't enough . did you play your best tennis of the tournament today ?
how important is it to have a match like this where you really are challenged ? because thus far at this tournament you have dominated .
what were you telling to yourself in the third set when you kept being ahead and she was coming back then the breaker was crazy and you had this 5all . what was going through your mind ?
at 5all in the tiebreaker , what did you think ? you know , you hit an ace . were you nervous at that point ?
to go up 65 in the breaker . you saved a break point 5all .
how often do you have to tell yourself , do n't be a chicken ?
did you know that the no.1 ranking was on the line ?
so when you went like this at the end to your box , that was n't ...
do you ever get nervous during matches anymore and were you nervous at any time today ?
when you faulted were you nervous or you just went for the serve too much ?
you put it behind you just like that ?
i want to ask you a question about your ambition . you said , `` i want this . '' does that mean i just want to win this tournament ? does it mean i want to be no.1 at the end of the year ? does it mean i want to win 10 grand slams ? what is your ambition about tennis ?
you have obviously had a great year since australia . maybe not the results , but did you miss not having the trophy ? did you miss it ? is that part of , i want to get that feeling back again ?
you have been working with your coach about three years now ?
how important was it for you to find the right person ? what was that process like ?
if you play maria in the next round , not looking too far ahead , just one match now , how would you describe what that match will depend on and what you 've learned from playing her this year ?
you were talking about learning to trust sam . how long has it taken you to trust your own instincts on court , or did that just come automatically ?
going back to the ace that was 5all , break point in the third set . you only served one ace in the whole match . does that show your ability to come up in the clutch ? did that feel like a clutch moment for you to come up with that ?
one ace down the middle .
it was a big moment to come up with the ace because she had she just got in front she could break for 65 .
the other thing was the squash shots that she came up with a few times and surprised you . do you see many of those on tour ? is that another one that sam has in her arsenal not many others do ?
with your win today you keep your no.1 ranking . you have a slam ; you 've been no.1 for a while . how meaningful is it to stay no.1 to you ?
maybe talk about bartoli a bit . you played her this year .
when you played maria at australia , what do you think the key to that match was ?
many people , especially europeans , the first time they come here do n't like the us open . they do n't like the energy . it 's too much . it 's overwhelming and distracting , crazy traffic . you obviously clearly love playing here . did you always feel that way , or was it an evolution to get there ? what 's it like to sort of get to the place where you love it ?
how did it feel ?
when she rallied back to 3all in the second set , were you concerned ?
were you nervous towards the end ?
why do you think you 're having the success at this stage of your career at this age ?
first quarterfinal . would you rather it not be against errani , of all the people you could play at this stage ?
do you feel like the italians are doing well ?
have you heard from them ?
agnieszka said she found playing against you was uncomfortable , the variety of shots , you kind of kept her off balance .
how does it feel to have to come into the big interview room ?
it looks like you never found your game out there today .
what was especially difficult for you out there with her game ?
you 've played her four times . you won four times . how tough is this loss to take ?
can you comment more about when you say that she played uncomfortable tennis .
you 're actually known for doing that as well sometimes , playing uncomfortable tennis .
do you think the fatigue of the season can play into this ?
no regrets playing the week before ?
taking a look at the tournament from the outside now , who would you say would be the favorite , in your opinion , or some of the favorites left in the women 's draw ?
what is it like for you to face serena ? have you ever played her when she 's been in the form she showed today ?
whether you 're winning or losing you seem to maintain the same demeanor ? is that a strategy to throw your opponent off ?
saying you 're playing against an opponent that you are expected to beat , they have match point against you , what runs through your mind at that moment ?
you reached a slam final this year . now that the four slams are done , do you feel pretty excited about the year you had so far ?
you played her in the past . this year she switched to a different racquet . does her shot seem better , more powerful , spin or whatever it is , her serve , her groundstrokes ?
but did she seem stronger this year than she had in the past ? you played her last year , the year before ; do her shots seem harder ?
is it hard to play someone who mixes it up so much , like every point you 're sometimes getting some high balls and just dropshots ?
you 've had a different schedule so far , on at night and then this morning you came in and played the first match , six games to none . are you a morning person ? how do you prepare for the different changes in schedule ?
in indian wells you talked about the biggest regret in your career , which is forehand dropshot you hit against maria in the australian open final . today you hit some like amazing forehand dropshots , so does it mean finally you get rid of your nightmare ?
how does it feel to reach the quarterfinals here ?
in '08 if you had known it would be four years , what would you have thought about it ?
it looks like you 'll likely play serena . in the past you have lost three matches , but do you think you had your chances in any of those sets ?
what do you have to do different on her serve as opposed to any other ?
i know there is no easy way to do this , but how would you describe the last four years of your tennis career ?
has novak been helpful to you in the roller coaster in any way ?
he obviously is playing well here , but not certainly at the level he was last year . it 's been a little more roller coaster for him . do you have any sense of why ? why do you think it is ?
now that you 've been able to reach a quarterfinal in a major , does it kind of raise the ceiling for what you think about when you look at the future or next year ?
there are some photos here from a hundred years ago of the champions of that time . both the men and the women played in neckties . the women in fulllength skirts and heels . could you play in that stuff , or do you prefer maybe what you 're wearing now ?
do you think that the foot injury aside you 're playing your best tennis of the year now ?
could you describe in what ways the second set was tougher today than your first set ?
is it fair to say that a racquet change has caused a career change for you ?
you could n't get that racquet from wilson ?
how would you assess your match today ?
what was the difference between this match and the one in paris ?
do you like the hard court better than clay or not as well ?
what do you think made the difference so that you won and not angelique ?
you and vinci have a very successful partnership . what do you think is the key to your doubles success with roberta ?
why are you so successful together ?
venus and serena , do you think the fact that they 're sisters and close as well helped them play doubles together ?
was that a nice tight hitout before the quarterfinals ?
were you thinking on those match points that she really rose to the occasion ?
a situation like that could really rattle a player . would you say that was the most pleasing thing , that you were able to stay calm and ride it out ?
did you feel confident in that situation because of what happened last year ?
nothing is a given , but if you do play azarenka , you have n't had a lot of success against her . are you confident you can turn it around here ?
can you give us an idea of what it is that 's given you some trouble with her ?
laura today certainly was trying to get forward as much as possible . the ball coming quick and hard is a good thing .
laura said she was surprised by how much you were able to mix up your serves . was that a key part of your preparation for this one ? have you got the ball on your string at the moment servingwise ?
a few times you got frustrated on your groundstrokes . do you have some trigger points to get back in the groove ?
probably the biggest crowd you played in front of all week . what was it like for you on court ?
you crossed paths with azarenka . you were out of there ; she 's going in . funny to see your next opponent looking like she 's getting ready for a rocky movie or something ?
what do you do tomorrow ?
are you going to make a habit of doing this dance after this one ?
he was still there , though . is he booked in for the quarterfinal as well ? will he be there every step of the way ?
you come off court feeling disappointed or satisfied with the performance that was quite strong at the end ?
very different in that way to anyone you played before ?
moving forward after the great week you have had , what can you take from this to push on ?
is the fact that you produced this consistency in performance proved to yourself that you really can compete with these girls ?
now that you 're out of the tournament , have you had a chance to digest that you will always be remembered as the person who played kim clijsters in her last singles match ?
what especially in the way you played the last three or four days have you been most pleased with ?
do you feel like you 'll be looked at a bit differently in the locker room after these wins ?
you said unforced errors today . you also appeared not to be hanging back on anything . you were swinging through all of your shots . do you count those as errors or just as an unsuccessful winner ?
now that you 've had these big wins , do you think you 're ready for more than this in the future ? do you see yourself in second weeks of slams ?
where is it next ?
when you watched that kim interview last night , were you crying ?
the asian leg for you , is the key reaching the level you achieved here on the regular tour to prove to yourself week in and week out you can get there ?
do you get any downtime or straight into tournaments again ?
have you been aware of the levels of support you 've had , especially from people back home who have been willing you on through this adventure ?
this shopping expedition , anything in particular you 're looking for ?
is there a particular serve of sam 's that you 'd never seen before and really caused you more issues than others , like the kicker out wide on the advantage side , for instance ?
what did you do when you realized the camera crew was for you ?
could you have expected when you arrived here in new york that you 'd beat two grand slam champions to earn that right to shop ?
do you have a ranking target where you want to be at the end of the year ?
have you worked out what this will do to your ranking ? have you been calculating a little bit ?
with your new coach , what will your training base be away from tournaments ?
it was a tough one out there today . maybe you were the most solid player on the key points ?
you are the kind of player who wo n't ever beat herself , like the player wo n't take the victory from you with winners or your level , making easy mistakes or something . do you feel that on the court that you 're solid ?
do you feel a little bit today especially that you 're playing against a mirror image of yourself ? you guys have such similar games out there .
what is the difference now that you 're up in the top 5 and j.j. has kind of dropped a bit . is it just that consistency , or what do you see it as the difference maker ?
do you look at her and say , i have to be careful because the same thing could happen to me as happened to her , you know , she goes into a bad period ?
you 're asked about this regularly , but how is your shoulder doing ?
your next round , vinci ?
you seem to handle the conditions much better than she did today . she had a pretty important point and she missed the overhead completely . few other times she lost them all in the sun . how much did it bother you and why do you think you were able to handle those conditions so well ?
when you have a player like that whose confidence is maybe a little bit shaky because of her recent results and things , do you tell yourself , well , i just have to stay in there and be patient ; at some point i 'll get the error or mistake and she 'll mentally lose it ?
going back to vinci , why do you think it is that some of these players are having success later in their careers ? we 're seeing fewer younger girls come up and be in the top . is there something in the game that sort of changed in the last five years in your perspective ?
talk about the game today , how the heat affects you and how you 're feeling .
is playing against venus the other night in that sort of situation great preparation and experience for you to win a grand slam ?
you played one other match that you lost on ashe ?
when was that ?
so there was a big difference between when you first faced serena and faced venus ?
do you feel like your success started here ? does it feel special being back ?
it seemed like for a thirdround match it was relatively easy for you .
what are your thoughts on playing sara errani in the next round ?
off court you seem like you 're pretty shy , but on court you show your emotions . do you feel like you 're quite different on and off court ?
first and second sets were almost like different matches . what was the difference between the two of them ?
must be really pleased with the serving , sam .
you play laura robson next . she seems in good form . a lefty . is it good to get a lefty before another lefty ?
have you had a chance to watch any of her matches before ?
how dangerous is it when you play a player like her since she 's on a hot streak , 18 years old , must be brimming with confidence coming off the defeat of li na ?
when you get deeper into the tournament , playing on center stage , ashe , how important is it to have had those experiences before such as you have had ?
are you feeling very confident right now ?
that experience you had on ashe in the past , was that key today at 5all in the breaker ?
heading into the lepchenko match you were hoping to maybe hit with a left hander , and now you have another one . how easy is it to find a lefthanded hitting partner ?
where do you matchup well with laura , do you think ?
do you know laura from the australian tennis system , or was that really one of the first times you had ever ...
last year you had rain delays , you were thrown from pillar to post . this year everything is going smoothly . you know when you 're playing . does it feel different this year ?
angelique kerber , yesterday she won against venus williams . what do you think , is she really a hard player here for you ?
you never played her before ?
first time ?
what do you think of her game ?
are you disappointed with the way you played today or do you think she just beat you ?
i heard the british radio reporter giving a live radio report , very excited , of course , and said that he thought she could be a top10 player in short amount of time . do you see her as somebody who could be a top10 player in a short amount of time ?
would you give her a good chance against stosur in the next round ?
on that performance today though , the tennis she played today would be good enough to beat stosur ?
will you go home at this point ? what are you going to add to your arsenal so you can move to the next round ?
how is the ankle ? can you say what happened yesterday ?
can you speak to andy roddick 's retirement .
did you believe him when he told you ?
you two have taken fairly parallel paths . talk about what it 's been like sharing that journey with andy .
there 's been a lot of talk about the decline of american tennis especially on the men 's side .
do you think people have taken what andy has accomplished for granted ?
i heard you say after the match you 're not even thinking about retiring .
has clijsters and roddick retiring put it in your head ?
you expressed a lot of emotion , particularly in the second set . it seemed you were expressing what looked like frustration . even in a moment that was positive , it looked like you were expressing something negative .
been a long time since the braids and the beads . you and your sister were responsible for a distinctive look as far as tennis style . how much are you concerned with being an ambassador for that ?
what color do you call that pink today ?
when talking about nike , we have to talk about michael jordan , his success even after he left the game . do you have a designer in specific that you work with ?
how much are you involved in the process of design ?
when was the last time you played on the grandstand court and how did it feel to be out there with your sister ?
you 've been asked about kim and andy leaving . what is your take on sloane ?
you played your heart out . is it frustrating to lose a heartbreaker like that ?
obviously it 's hard to take away too many positives , but you did push very hard against a player you struggled against a lot before this year . any moments where you were proud of the way you were fighting ?
how tough a draw is she in the second round ?
is this the latest you ever played here at ashe , and how do you recuperate for your doubles match ?
did you hear the one woman shouting out a lot during your points ?
how did that feel to have the crowd behind you like that ?
i believe the first five games were breaks in the first set . have you ever gone through that before ?
when you have errorprone matches against her , is it bad luck or because it just happens to be against her ?
it 's a long way out from the city to get here . how long do you think it will be before you 're able to relax tonight and go to sleep ?
is that easy for you ?
andy roddick announced his retirement today . what were your thoughts on that ?
you 're not ready ?
obviously an extremely long day for you but great result . take us through your day a little bit .
how much did you worry ? did you think it was a solvable problem from the start ?
was it a chickenandtheegg thing , you had to make the shots first before you got comfortable ?
do you think you 'll be ready for the next round ?
serena has talked a lot about how great of a player you are . what have you gotten from her relationship ?
curious about your doubles game . how much does that help you with singles ? does that give you some techniques , some help playing singles ?
has serena given you any advice about handling the open or new york , to deal with the craziness of this slam ?
if she 's not discussing actual technical things with you regarding tennis , does she discuss the way to handle the tour ?
mixed doubles yesterday . singles and doubles today . mixed doubles tomorrow .
you 're on the schedule , i think . how are you able to keep up with that type of schedule ?
could you talk about the match .
what does it mean to come in here as the second seed ? is no.1 on your mind ?
is that an ambition of yours , to be the top player in the world ?
jelena is who you will play next . talk about that .
did n't seem like in the first set you were playing with a lot of confidence . is that because the last few weeks have been tough on you ?
when you were down a set and a break , what were you thinking ?
did you see , after a while , her confidence level go down ?
can you talk about your shoulder . since wimbledon your results have not been what they were before that . is that injury , or are you just feeling a little bit mentally you needed a break and maybe now you 'll get back to where you were ?
mentally do you feel fresh enough to be able to do what you did at wimbledon , or do you feel the season has been so long that you just need to relax now ?
did you realize when you were down 13 and you had that breakpoint against you , you hit the huge forehand winner , did you realize you were taking a big risk at that point ?
for you at that moment maybe moving to a more aggressive standpoint after having all those errors in the first set ?
do you play more aggressive when you take on jankovic in the next round , or do you kind of hit out with her and wait for her to make the errors ?
do you ever notice what your opponents do across the net ? jankovic has a lot of facial expressions . can you see that , or is it just you on your side of the court ?
you played very , very well two matches in a row . just talk about how pleased you are with the match today ?
you have had more than your share of injuries this year . are you feeling right now 100 % ?
antiinflammatories , pain medication , that kind of thing ?
you have had a taste of world no.1 . you had a taste of a grand slam victory . how hungry are you to get that back ?
speaking of being at the top , at the moment the focus is probably on serena and maria in the draw . i just wanted to get your thoughts on what it 's like , what your thoughts are on their games and what it 's like to face them and if you have any kind of relationship with them as people .
you have n't played much on the hard courts this summer . does that hurt your game or is that overrated ?
how worried were you after you had to pull out of canada and you found out you had a foot injury and all that ? excuse me , cincinnati .
is it muscle or bone ?
so the tear really has n't healed yet ?
kim just stepped aside in terms of ending her singles career . we have heard many , many nice things said about her . do you have a particular story or incident or interaction with her that expresses who she is as a person ?
do you see yourself playing to age 30 , or is that just too long of a career ?
the tennis players in particular are some of the few female athletes that are consistently able to get endorsements and get money outside of tennis through brands and starting new companies . i wonder why you think tennis players are so successful at being able to do that .
is there attention for you as a player between making sure you 're excelling on court and your performance is there , but also trying to look for opportunities ?
today you have been talking about your injuries ; you did the other day . but you also said the other day that tennis is hard on the heart . how is it hard on the heart ?
you might end up playing sloane stephens . i do n't know how much contact you had with her . do you see any of yourself in her ?
i 'm talking more in terms of personality . she might do the same .
you say you get emotional when you lose in front of the public eye . do you feel responsible that people , say , leave the stadium and say , oh , ana is my favorite player and she lost ?
while we are comparing you to other players , in a way you can say you and kim have some similarities : both from relatively small european countries , longtime prime rival also from your country , and trying to be positive towards everyone . do you see some similarities between yourself and kim ?
do you know that this is the second straight grand slam that chris evert has picked you as the woman sleeper ?
espn.com , this is second straight time that chris evert pick you as a women 's sleeper in the women 's draw .
it means someone who could go very far .
according to your opinion , this is a long process from a sleeper position to get a potential title ?
caroline and francesca being knocked out of your quarter , do you ever look ahead to see who is still in , out ?
are you able to talk a little bit about what happened at the ending with the shuffle ?
how did you meet him ?
was it a spontaneous thing ?
did you nail it ?
was there good energy out on the court ?
two dominant wins . do you feel like you got your teeth in the tournament now ?
have you played your next opponent ?
she played rodionova . will you talk to her , some scouting advice ?
she 's a lefty as well .
kim retiring , your thoughts on that .
kim was someone you could have actually met in the fourth round . are you disappointed you did n't get a chance to hit against her one last time ?
kim 's retirement is a pretty big story today and overshadowed your victory . are you happy to fly under the radar ?
how about that forehand set up for match point ? one of the best shots you ever hit ?
was it a hard place to dig yourself out of ? you did n't appear to be disappointed by the missed match points .
what do you think this result says about the state of your game and perhaps even your potential ?
obviously she 's a player that you respect . how hard is it to keep the occasion out of your mind , you were the one putting an end to her career ?
laura , you looked like you could n't believe it at the end , but did you really believe it beforehand ?
given the progress you 've made this year , what do you think the main improvements you 've made are ?
how did you find playing on arthur ashe ?
you have n't been with your new coach for very long . would you say that change has had any input into this result ?
in the last month or so you 've added a big line to your cv with the silver medal , one thing that clijsters never even had in her career , an olympic medal . how much do you think the confidence of that moment helped you in a match like this ?
you said that you were really trying to keep out the thought that you could be the last opponent in her career . were there moments at all in the match where that thought occurred to you , or was it only afterwards ? could you describe what that was like , to realize that you have that distinction .
do you feel like the girl that shot bambi ?
the matches against sharapova that you did n't win , did they inspire you ?
you talked on court about kim being a role model for you . what particular qualities do you think ?
obviously this is a big individual scalp for you , but also your first time in the third round of a slam , which has to feel like a pretty big accomplishment . how much does that level of what you 've accomplished mean to you ?
do you think this win will change the way you 're going to be perceived in the locker room around the tour ?
did you prove anything to yourself in this match ? you delivered in a big match on a big stage .
how would you describe the pressures that you perceive on british players given the grand slam drought ?
what are your thoughts on the way andy has handled his career and dealt with the various pressures ?
did you see any of johanna 's match , and how good is it to have some company in the tournament ?
you were saying the other day you 're feeling more comfortable this year than you have in the past on american hard courts . is that feeling continuing ?
you 're happy with the way you were able to get out of trouble ?
when is the last time you felt this good about your tennis ?
that 's a long time .
after you were on the court after you won the french open not playing well , were you actually thinking about things off the court , getting your picture taken , or i have to go do a commercial ? why did it distract you so much ?
in some ways you had to improve your game this summer so the players do n't come to the court and , boom , boom , win ?
if kim advances , you would play her in the next round . talk about what you would anticipate from that matchup . you could be her last professional match .
will you drink if you win the next round ?
feels a little strange ?
you would feel bad if you beat her because you would be the bad girl who beat kim clijsters in her last professional tournament ?
plus two australian opens you were very close to beating her , no ?
we 're playing here in new york . there 's so much media . could you step back and say the one or two things we americans do n't understand about your country , what would that be ?
did you expect to be in interview room 1 at the us open ?
what did you do well today and what was it like out there doing it well ?
how nervous were you ?
how much did you know about her going in ? she won a silver medal at the olympics pretty recently .
can you take us through the last couple weeks , getting the wildcard , what it 's been like .
did you know the usta pro circuit determines that there was an automatic wildcard there . did you know that was a possibility ? were you trying for that ?
when did you find out ? i mean , how soon did you actually know that that actually happened before they actually announced the wildcards ? when did they tell you that ?
used to be that players tried to get to the pro circuit as soon as possible . could you talk about the stanford experience , going to the farm both as a person and as a tennis player ?
what did you major in and what did your coaches tell you about the transition to the pro circuit ?
now , are you going back to school or are you done ?
this does n't change ?
even the money ? even leaving the money on the table ?
you are n't even going to look at what you could have won today ?
even without andrew luck you 're actually going to go back to stanford ?
seems like your game is maybe not typical for a lot of the college players trying to make the pro circuit . some are defensive and trying to get balls back . you 're more assertive . men have been successful switching from college to pro . do you think your game is built for that transition better than other female players ?
seems very likely your next match will be against maria sharapova , which is likely it will be on ashe , maybe like cbs in the afternoon or something . what would be your expectations , that experience , be like ?
have you modeled your game at all after her ?
melanie oudin played her third or fourth round a few years ago and beat her . when you walk out there , do you think you 're going to be able to win ?
was pro tennis , you always planned when you went to stanford did you figure you 'd be pro eventually or not ?
so what 's happened ?
it sounds like you were really thinking of maybe after this last season getting a real job , so to speak . i guess what job were you going to get and how seriously have you been making plans eventually to do that versus tennis ?
sounds like the summer was not just about results but just the lifestyle . is that fair to say ? what were you worried about ?
stanford tennis is sort of a whole culture . have you gotten input over the years from coach gould or have you met condoleeza rice ? just talk about that .
your next opponent is known for her baseline conferences with herself after points . as someone who wants to go into psychiatry , what does that say about sports psychology , gameplan management , and the like ?
another strong match . talk about the match and how you feel you played .
her weapon seemed to be the slice backhand . what did you do to counter that ?
jie zheng in the next round .
you have played her before . what can you anticipate from that matchup ?
it was in 2009 in tokyo .
two years ago you had to retire . the third round has kind of been your threshold . in your mind do you feel you need to get past that in order to validate anything ?
do you feel very different coming into this year than any previous year at the open considering everything that 's happened so far this year ? should we consider you a different player than the one who has come here in the past ?
this is kim clijsters ' final tournament . can you share some of your memories of what it was like playing against her ?
would you describe shopping as your hobby ?
this tournament and all the other slams we have a day off between matches . is that easier on you , or is it a challenge to keep your focus instead of playing every day and showing up the next day knowing you have to play ?
you really kicked butt today . it 's amazing . your game is just on point . from last year , the muscle weight you gained , the mental capacity . who helped you develop that ?
becoming friends with serena , does that mean she tells you things about how to play the game and win points and maybe beat her ?
was it a point of pride , a maturing point almost , looked like you had a match point go up the line , it was good , they called it out . how did you put that away and move on ?
was there a time that might have bothered you more ?
what do you take from this match going forward ?
how is the coach sharing going ?
on a day like this when you 're both playing , is it complicated ?
in terms of your past life with serena , how was her serve back then ?
can you tell us now what really happened in spain when you were melting down .
could you have imagined the runs you 've had in paris and london and now beating francesca ?
did you feel like it was an upset today or that you were supposed to win ?
when you get a win over a seeded player , does it build belief in yourself that you belong here ?
have you seen yourself on some posters around town ?
you mentioned your family . knowing they 're in the stands , how does that help you in the game ?
do you feel like sam is on his way to making a big breakthrough ?
did you have to make any adjustments with the wind out there today ?
is sloane stephens going to be our next superstar ?
when you walked past the big poster of yourself , did anybody recognize that it was you ?
do you have an american express card ?
that was an incredible game , 35. have you played a longer game than that ?
14 .
was that a key , do you think ?
your emotions when you won ?
you made a lot of mistakes in the first . it can get away from you quite quickly in the second set .
mentally you must be delighted the way you came back to produce some of those shots very late in a very important period of the match as well .
you 've been around playing on the lower levels of the tour . you seem to be making quite decent progress the last six or eight months . is there any particular reason why you think ? are you just growing ? things have clicked into place ?
who are the team ?
the results have revved up since citizenship came through . was that a weight off your mind ?
what part of the questions were being asked ?
was there any stage where you thought it was n't going to happen ?
did someone in particular go in to bat for you to help it through ?
when did the process of trying to make the switch actually start ?
i do n't mean the exact legal process .
has that process dragged on ? do you think that affected your performances on the court ?
yes .
who is here with you apart from your coaching team ? your parents here ?
did they force you to learn the national anthem ?
were there odd questions ?
what was the craziest question they asked ?
you 've been in the uk for a while , so you feel british ?
did you watch the olympics ? did you get a high ?
do you have any connection with hungary other than the fact your parents come from there ?
you did n't happen to know your opponent today ?
you did n't know her personally ?
is it like you won a doubles title with her ?
the official biography says you live in eastbourne .
( question regarding time spent at academy . )
what is all this like ? you 're in the second round of the us open . it 's quite a big change for you , is n't it ?
laura and heather are inside the top 100. do you have a target for yourself ? do you feel like a top 100 player ? where do you see yourself going ?
does it help having those two ?
do you have a lot to do with heather and laura ?
do you practice with them , socialize with them ?
have you dealt much with judy murray , fed cup captain ?
what do you see as your best asset ?
if you could , just describe your first match .
having just that one match before on a hard court , what do you have to work on going forward ?
what were your expectations coming into this tournament ?
obviously you were hurt , but when you have your last result that you played as a double bagel against you , is that hard psychologically at all for you ?
did you consider that day like not playing or pulling out at all ?
have you learned to play with pain , play through injury ? because everybody does .
it seems like you 're a lot thinner than you were in recent years . is that something intentional or from exercising as much as you do ?
you said your expectations for this tournament are different because of your injuries , but in general , over the last few years how have you had to sort of adjust expectations , do you think , in a set , something that 's hard to do for you ?
do you feel like the same person on court that you were like four , five years ago ?
novak djokovic was asked about you and jelena having dropped a little bit since you all came up at the same time . he said you both have the ability and you were no.1 and won a grand slam . he said it 's just mental at this point . your agree with that ?
did you realize how close you were to having a golden set ?
the last year you have had to deal with increased expectations from the public . i guess just talk about the pressure of defending a grand slam . i mean , do you feel like this is more or less pressure than let 's say the australian open this year , or is it the same amount and you 've just learned how to deal with it better over the last seven months ?
how did it feel back out on that stadium and playing in front of the crowd again ?
would you say it was pretty much the perfect match for you or is there anything you 'd like to work on more ?
many players say the first round , it 's always a little bit spooky , etcetera . of course you 're defending champion . were you at all worried ? did you ever think , oh , my gosh what if i go out there and bomb it and i 'm out by 1:00 in the afternoon ?
the first 19 points , you 're really close at that point to that golden set . i know you said you thought about it , but were you just a little bit nervous or were you saying , i can do this , i can do this ? what were you thinking at that point ?
was that nerves or ...
you spoke before about being last year in a good place the entire way through ; is that how you felt at the moment ?
what particularly about this court makes your game so effective here ?
how different are night matches out here ? you have played in the past at night ? how different are they here for the conditions , for the mood of the crowd , and so on as opposed to the day ?
some people have hated coming in here at night to play . does this bother you ?
maybe talk about not being able to avoid the press when you 're back in australia . you know , you take backpage headlines in various newspapers , but not fairly outthere headlines about you . does that sort of stuff affect you when you 're on court or when you 're preparing for the matches , or how does that actually play out as a detractor for you ?
you said the other day you were very pleased with the turn of events since you 've come over and have been on the hard courts , feeling good . is this right now about as good as you 've felt about your game in the 2012 season ?
is this an ideal way to open this campaign ?
not too many wta players are named sam . can you take a moment and say like what the upside of having a name like that is , is there any downside , or give us on a rainy day a good story about your name .
so is your grandfather a traditionalist and not happy for it to be shortened ?
lindsay davenport , when she returned after winning the us open , she said as she flew over the stadium coming into the new york , her whole body began to tingle . how many times have you been to newyork since winning here last year ?
not at all . what was it like for you ? what was it like for you stepping back into newyork ? have you had a chance to walk around the grounds to reflect ?
having that week before the grand slam practice here , so many times when you 're on the road you 're living out of a suitcase at a hotel . here you can rent an apartment and be in one place for a couple of weeks at a time . does that make newyork feel more like home , and that you feel comfortable and ready to go ?
are you in the city or ...
how pleased are you with the result out there today ?
what were the last few weeks like for you ?
feel better ?
why all those tests for just a stomach bug ? did you think it was bigger ?
why ?
so the night before the olympic final , how bad was the pain ?
that did n't pass the smell test . what was it like ? was it a serious pain ? did it impact your play ?
after all the development , the planning , the trips to spain , it 's finally going to come out , if i understand correctly , but there 's a little bit of a problem . there 's a guy named roger federer who has lindor truffles . as a marketing person now , how would you tell america to try sugarpova and not roger 's ?
ultimately can a gumball stand up to a truffle ?
it sounds like you were hurting at the olympics . when you get into a thing where you lose like that , is it one of those things that you just hit the delete button the second you walk off the court or is it something that sticks with you until you get back on the court again ?
were you actually able to get to sleep at night after you carried the flag ?
that must have been an incredible experience for you .
what went through your mind as you were carrying the flag around the track ?
since the comeback you 've reached the final of the other three slams but not here . what would it mean to make a run into the second week ?
obviously the tests went well in montral . it turned out it was a stomach bug of some sort . what was going through your mind when you were feeling pain like that ? must have been pretty serious to need all that , or at least felt like it was .
in your years here you worked with a lot of individuals . how would you compare the culture of sports in america , training , and in russia ?
well , just the culture of sports . here it 's so dynamic , so individualistic . there 's an economic engine to it . can you compare the cultures ?
if you become a mom , would you bring your kid to an academy ? do you like the academy environment ?
to keep playing tennis day after day , it 's something that helps you not to think too much about your upcoming marriage or not ? normally for a woman it 's a big moment . you do n't have almost the time to think about what 's going on .
it 's not ?
not in this year anyway ?
this first set was obviously the key today .
you played a lot since the french open . how do you feel coming into this us open with all the victories you had in the summer ?
you have asthma . are you doing something in the states ?
you made the final here . are you pretty happy with your form ?
second straight match in which you won the first set 61 and lost the second set . what do you think you were able to do in the semifinal to keep yourself in that one that you were n't able to do today ?
you seemed to be getting quite emotional during the stretch she was winning all the games . were you getting angry with yourself a little bit ?
physically were you all right or was there anything ...
is your ankle okay ? seemed like you grabbed it at the end of the second set .
you mentioned getting more matches in dallas . do you feel like you need more matches this close to the us open with how many you got in cincinnati ?
would you prefer to take next week off if you could ?
it was in dallas last year i think some of your good form started . compare where you were this time a year ago , ranked in the 90s , and where you are now .
is there one major thing that changed to make this huge rise possible ?
yesterday when we talked i ask what are the tactics for the match with li na , what do you have to do to beat her . you said , i do n't know yet because i have to talk with coach . obviously you had tactics . the plan was not good enough to beat her or the execution of the plan was not proper today ?
physically you were okay or you were struggling ?
you beat serena and petra here . that 's such a high . is it hard going into a final to still be all really excited after coming from so much excitement ?
she won 11 of the last 12 games . did you try to change something in that stretch ?
looks like on monday you 'll go up to a careerhigh no.6 .
if i read the wta 's notes correctly . what are your thoughts on that ? that 's pretty incredible .
you seem like a person who is able to focus on match by match , point by point , week by week . does n't look like you look forward too much . is that something you 've had to learn ?
how ? did you work with someone or just on your own you 're managing it ?
do you think li na is doing anything obviously better since the last time you played her ?
talk a little bit more about the time you spent with andrea petkovic last year training . where were you ? what happened during those three weeks ? what did you work on ?
have you been giving her encouragement ? has she needed it this year as she 's been struggling with injury ?
two straight finals for you now in north america . has to feel pretty good .
what do you think you 're doing well ?
you made two finals , so just lately .
are you feeling tired ? do you feel it in your body now ?
she was serving very slow in the match . did that surprise you ? seemed like you were having a lot problems adjusting to that speed ?
was it difficult , because the serve was coming in slow , but off the ground she was hitting as hard as she normally does ?
what happened in the second set ?
you called carlos after the first set that you won .
then you let him sit down .
when you lost the second set you did n't call him . why ?
you can play either kvitova or kerber in the final . talk about each of them . i know you played petra in montral .
before you played , what was your plan for the match ?
how is you 're husband dealing with now he 's husband and no longer coach ? how is he dealing with the change ?
you 're used to playing serena . is it weird to have serena watching you play ?
what do you look forward to doing in new york away from the tennis ?
if you could change one thing about the us open , what would that be ?
tough match . what were your thoughts on it ? what changed in the third set ?
you won montral ; made the semifinals here . how much better are you feeling about your us open chances than you were two weeks ago ?
can you talk about her defense and where she might rate now in terms of best defensive players in the wta ?
a lot of people have compared her game to caroline 's , being more defensive and things . are they similar or different ? can you compare the two ?
do you like playing another lefty or does it matter at all ?
you played li na a week ago in the final in montral and you played angelique just now . who has the advantage in the final ?
in the second set what advice gave you your coach when he came to the court ?
and what about the third set ?
we saw you get quite frustrated on the court and stuff . were you frustrated with tactically what you were trying to decide to do and you thought the tactics were wrong , or because you did n't execute the shot ?
so new haven ?
so still going to play ?
what 's your favorite thing to do in new york when you 're away from tennis ?
where ?
did you experience anything this week with your asthma or is it significantly better ?
tough match today , obviously . how much do you take out of this with respect to your preparation for the open ?
as you said , disappointing , but it was such a high quality match . can you allow yourself to enjoy a match like that while that 's happening ?
you have played venus three times from the beginning of kind of her comeback to a little bit in the middle and now . how have you seen her game kind of progress since she 's come back ?
could you assess your play today , especially from the first set to the second ?
for most of the match venus ' firstserve percentage was in the mid 40s . do you think that she was going for maybe a little bit more against you ? what was it like being on the receiving end of her serve ?
next up for you is new york .
what are you going to do for the next i guess little over a week that you have until the tournament starts ?
are you expecting it to be any different now that you do n't have anything else besides being the defending champion in new york ?
two convincing wins today . how do you feel physically ?
you 've got venus williams next . 20 against . you have n't played her in two years . are you excited about that matchup ?
do you remember back in your first two meetings what worked for you , why you were effective against her ?
you have been working with carlos for a couple days now . how is it going so far ?
what was it like meeting him in person for the first time ? is he different than you expected at all ?
you said you got text messages from him . were those mostly support or suggestions on tactics against opponents ?
carlos came out . you called him in the second set and you had won nine games . she had only won one . why call a coach then ?
what did he tell you ?
how are you feeling physically after a couple matches ? i know it 's early , but how does it feel different playing two matches in one day ?
carlos only really coached one player before mostly , justine henin . what do you remember about watching her play ? is there anything in particular in her game that made her so successful you 'd like to add to your game ?
are you going to be able to consult with her at all , or do you plan on reaching out to her with respect to ...
you made the final last week and now you 're into the semifinals . is this as confident as you 've been in your tennis for maybe almost a year ?
you said that he is too skinny . maybe you try to convince him to change the chinese diet so he will get strong like you are .
seemed like a fairly comfortable win for you with a tricky opponent ?
when you have a good crowd like that and when you play some of the bigger slams and you have had great results there , does the crowd actually kind of help you stay focused and even keeled throughout the match having that support ?
you have radwanska next . you have n't played her , but she 's been playing well and she 's a smart player .
how do you approach playing someone like her ?
not sure if you heard , but rafa is out of the us open .
what is it like when he 's not in the locker room at slams ? what does he bring that might be ...
does it affect the buzz of the tournament even when somebody on the other draw is out ? can that really carry over to the women 's side ?
you do n't seem like a shy person . have you gone up to nadal and said , hey , i 'm sloane ; i wanted to meet you ; i think you 're cool ?
he could be the mixed doubles partner you 're looking for .
rafa .
brian baker ?
you 're in love with brian baker and rafa ?
if you say that to brian baker that might not be a good introduction .
tough one out there . the conditions looked really bad heat and humiditywise . how were you able to handle it ? how is the recovery going ?
did you do anything special to combat the heat today ? just drink a lot more water or any fluids or anything ?
how much of today was a result of maybe being tired from montreal , and how much of it was being tired from the conditions and having a hard time breathing ?
win is a win .
do you think it 's a good sign that you can win a match like that in the heat and humidity going to newyork in two weeks if it 's going to be a little warm there ?
was that maybe your best win , you know , in north american hard courts under these sort of humid conditions , do you think ?
what do you feel that you did well in the second two sets to be able to win ?
not too long ago you were very close to being no.1 in the world , and i was wondering , with respect to that , what 's your goal forgetting there eventually ?
you mentioned about improving your game . what specifically are you looking to improve upon ?
are you concerned by like power of the serve or placement or consistency ?
a bit of a funny question , but sometimes you wear the visor . sometimes you wear the headband . in the last two games you have been taking the headband or visor off in the middle and playing better .
yeah , i 'm asking why .
one of the best players of all time is your countrywoman , martin navratilova . do you have interaction with her and consult with her ?
in the first set of the match , kirilenko hit a drop shot . after you got the ball back you were holding your arm . everything okay ?
during the second set , at the end of second set , kirilenko hit a second serve and you looked at it and you almost challenged it but you did n't . why not ? it looked out from my point of view .
it was set point and she served .
what changed in the third set ?
what was going through your mind when you served for the match twice in the second set ?
roger said the olympics in 2016 are on his radar . how about you ?
the olympics were such a goal for you and you got gold there . how satisfying was that first , and then is it at all tough to keep going after that enormous climax for you ?
when did it hit you ? we saw you and serena on the podium sharing a moment as the national anthem played . when did it really sink in ?
where did you put the fourth medal ?
serena said she got north korea . what was the best pin you were able to get ?
you do something special to get that one ?
what athletes did you get to meet in london ?
michael phelps ?
serena mentioned the overall medal count . how conscious of that were you during the games ?
how is your health ? how are you doing ?
given that the olympics was an extra tournament to think about , did you have to think about curtailing your schedule at all ? everything going the way you wanted it to here ?
because you 're learning to contend with your health better , is that the reason you played better at the olympics and got a good win here today ? roland garros and wimbledon obviously were n't your best matches ?
when there is a bad day do you have to skip or curtail practice ?
so you 're coping better with it . just being a player ranked 14 in the world , what kind of expectations are you bringing into the us open ? are you excited ?
given the fact that you 're not 100 % all the time , have you made any changes to your game ? have you done some different things on the court ? tried different shots ?
how have you been practicing here ?
you 're saying you 're aiming at playing rio , which is 2016 , 22 years past your first match as a pro . that 's a long time .
during the match you were looking like you were struggling either physically or mentally in the match . can you talk about that a little bit ?
clearly after you won match point you were n't happy with your play , but you did survive .
were you expecting eleni to get so many of your balls back ?
with your strings with the racquet , i saw you speaking with sasha and sasha rewrapping .
given the quick turnaround from grass to here , are you going to do anything in practices leading up to your next matches ?
following wimbledon you had mentioned in the post conference that , you know , a lot of people do n't necessarily give you credit for all the hard work you put into the sport off the court . can you elaborate a little bit about that ?
how do you look at your fitness now compared to throughout the years ? you looked really fit when you were here yesterday . we talked about that you 're really fit compared to last year . so where are you at as far as overall ?
speaking of older , we 've seen some more mature players winning a lot of the grand slams the last couple of years . i 'm just wondering if experience these days pays off more than maybe in the days with crissy and monica and all those teenagers . you were a teenage champion , too , but ...
li na ?
was the hair more of a distraction tonight than it has been in the past matches ?
this is a new look for you , is n't it ?
talk about the third set . you were down 40 and then won six straight games .
you won 88 % of your first serve points in the second set and 64 % in the second set .
what do you think was the cause of the second set getting away from you , the second set with the tiebreak ?
how much of slow start in the third was being distracted thinking , you know , why am i in a third set here ?
did you feel the vibe with the crowd in the third set ? you were down 40 , like i said , and the night crowd came in and they were really getting behind you late in the third set .
was it a struggle with the timing in the third set ? there were quite a few forehanders that were just pushed a little long or shanked off left and right .
how are you feeling now physically ? tired ?
would you have preferred to have a shorter match , or is this match okay as the first round as long as you get through it ?
two weeks from the open , being so close to it , does it feel like it has been quick this last year ? kind of shocked that we 're back in newyork soon ?
your record since the french has been sort of probably not where you 'd want it to be sort of at this stage , us open series . is that concerning you at all sort of going forward with your prep ?
pretty much all the matches you have played in your career have been bestofthree set matches since you 're on the wta tour , slams and the regular tour events . there has been some discussion after the olympics where bestofthree for the men , making it bestofthree at slams for them as well . do you have any thoughts on that possible change ?
changing subjects a little bit , you played mixed doubles in the past and been a mixed doubles grand slam champion . can you talk about playing mixed , what you enjoyed about it , what you did n't enjoy about it as much ?
in your partnerships with bob , with scott , like what made them really successful , you know , mixed doubles partnerships in your opinion ?
i think you won five straight games after speaking with your coach . what did he tell you out there ?
talk about your coaching change . you 've had a switch there .
how did that come about ?
why the transition ? you had some pretty good results under roger , huh ?
so this was right after wimbledon ?
the decision to make the change from roger to david full time was wimbledon ?
you had the great roland garros and then third round at wimbledon . you did n't feel like you were progressing quite enough ?
you committed to it before what ?
you had some really good results on clay . is that your most comfortable surface ?
will you be training in europe for the clay court season or here ?
you had a nice result in d.c. , but after wimbledon was there a bit of a letdown ? how big was it get this win today ?
healthy ?
hat 's best for you going into the open : going in playing matches or going in resting that few days before ?
how much do you know about your next opponent ?
today was the first i learned about your coaching change . can you just share a couple of points of what you really extracted most from your guidance under roger ?
any particular tactics that you were able to get from him ?
specifically what do you think you need to improve to get where you want to go ?
so it 's something you 're actively working on with david , just going point by point and not mentally checking out in important times ?
what makes you lose your focus ? is it surroundings ?
during matches do you ever hear photographers clicking , things like that ?
what do you love and what do you hate about the us open ?
nothing you dislike about it ?
do you find yourself playing better in front of big crowds ? do you like having a big crowd around you ?
who has been your favorite doubles partner ?
are you planning to play mixed too or just doubles ?
sam wo n't even play with you ?
what about donald ?
why do you say nobody will play with you ?
what results would make you happy over the next month ?
you got to the second week of roland garros ; second week of the us open a possibility ?
talk about your match today , how you felt out there .
is it tough to transition , wimbledon then the olympics and now come to the hard court season here in cincinnati and going to the us open ?
how did you celebrate after the olympics , winning is the bronze with petrova ?
where are you keeping the medal ? is it with the rest of your trophies or is it in a special place ?
with this result today and new york coming up , are you going to look to play next week to get some more match play in ?
do you plan on playing doubles with petrova in the us open ?
talk a little bit about your camaraderie with petrova . you 've done really well this year . how did the partnership begin ? did you approach her or did she approach you ?
speaking about your singles , what 's changed with your game ? you had a good run , and a couple years kind of dipped a little bit . talk about what you worked on or what 's changed in your game ? is it mental ?
talk a little bit about venus and how she looked out there . you fought back very well in the second set . you actually had two games where you came back from love40 .
talk about the stress of dealing with that third set , because certainly the match turned around . if i would have told you 15 years ago you 'd be right here with five wimbledon titles , what would you have said ?
why did you get anxious ?
why were you so excited if it 's something you 've been working on ?
you celebrated because you pulled off the dropshot or because you knew you had the match in hand ?
when you won here two years ago you had an incredible amount of things happen to you , up and down , up and down . can you sort of review the low points , the foot and everything , a month ago at the french , then coming back to this high level .
in the middle of the third set you hit four aces to win a game . that 's when the wind dropped . was the wind bothering you in the second set ?
have you ever hit four aces in a row to win a game ?
after the match on court when you thanked your family and mentioned esther as well and said you could n't have done it without them . can you elaborate on what exactly they did to help you through that emotional time ?
we 've seen your mentally tough side . i think we saw your vulnerable side a little bit more this wimbledon . can you talk about that .
emotionally vulnerable , letting it out a little bit on court ; we do n't see tears that much .
what made you get off that couch ? how can you top this , what you 've done today ? what more do you want from life ?
what could top this now ? what more do you want from life ?
after the couple of bad years that you fought through , i guess this has to be the beginning of a new good phase rather than the culmination of it .
martina was in the box , steffi too . are they real targets now ?
people going on about the 30 business , you still have plenty enough years in you ?
roger was in here yesterday talking about the fact when he was playing novak , he was flashing back to the us open , the match point that he lost . today when you 're playing , do you have any flashbacks to what happened in paris ?
a moment ago you described the journey to this moment . how has that journey affected your appreciation of this title in different ways than all of your others ?
how would you describe the way you dominated in this tournament with your serve ?
roger often talks about pete sampras being one of his idols growing up . does it mean anything to you that you have 14 slams like pete sampras out of 18 finals like pete sampras ?
with this campaign out of the way , with all the trophies you have , how important is the olympics gold medal singles to you ?
we 're used to seeing you bounce back quickly from whatever trials and tribulations you 're going through . why was this one a longer road and tougher ?
your knee injury , and you came back ...
your support team said that god was with you . what else went through your mind ? what did you do to turn it around and get through it all ?
can you describe the appreciation you have deep inside being different now winning this tournament than years ago because of what you went through also , but just everything ? is it a different feeling now ?
did you model any of your serve on pete ?
how did it change ?
when you put your achievement alongside venus ' here at wimbledon obviously that 's 10 of the last 13 wimbledon championships that you two have won what in your mind is the single kind of defining explanation for what makes the two of you so wellsuited to this tournament ?
now that you 've won the singles , do you feel a kind of pressure to want to win the doubles for venus ' or your sake ?
how will you feel going into this doubles match ?
so no pressure from venus ?
we talked for a long time over the years about the difficulty of your position of you and venus having to play each other . can you talk about how maybe you 've lifted each other up . would you have as many if venus did n't exist ?
venus has talked about this , and you have , too . she 's the older sister and picks you up when you 're down . she 's been through some tough times recently , too . has the relationship changed where you 've come into more of a supportive role now ?
put your experience out there today in your own words , please .
as big and strong as serena is , is there ever an intimidation factor playing somebody like that ?
how were you feeling physically coming in ? you had some problems the other day . did it affect you coming into the match ? also , after the first set , what were you telling yourself in terms of putting it all together and getting back into the match ?
the second set , it appears like you fought hard . the third one was like you gave up . did you give up at any stage , it 's over ? did you feel like it was over before it was over ?
when you went in for the rain break , what was going through your mind and what did you do to refocus ?
how surprised were you by that dropshot ? then how tough is her serve ? she had the four aces .
just on the dropshot , were you surprised as everybody else ?
how would you assess your serving ? is it the best you 've ever served ?
do you count aces ? did you know you broke your own record today ?
what did it feel like if it did n't feel like 24 ?
how much better can it be then , do you feel ?
a year ago here when you won in the first round , you had really pronounced emotions . can you reflect on the road from that moment to the joy you have today ?
of all the things you 've accomplished in your career , what is your appreciation for this stretch ?
first of all , you were in major attack mode today , i thought more than even usual . you were just slamming away at everything . was that something that you wanted to do ?
you were attacking her first serve , just all over it . nonstop attack mode .
you made more aces in one set than radwanska in the whole tournament , so that helps probably for the final . out of 18 slam finals you won 13 and you lost 4. you 're tied sixth all time with hart , goolagong , and king . that sounds interesting to you or you do n't care ?
have you ever heard of hart before ?
yes .
there 's been so many great tennis comeback stories , kim having a child , jennifer capriati , agassi . do you consider your comeback , now that you 've made two finals from your illness and injury last year , to be quite special as well ?
one more question about your serve today . when people talk about athletes being in a zone where everything just works well , does that describe how you felt when you went up to serve today ?
winning a doubles title with venus , what would that mean with what she 's gone through ?
you had the great win against the defending champion , then beat victoria , no.1 , and now you play radwanska , who has a great game . there might be a chance that a player might either come down or come out flat . at times you 've had problems along those lines . how do you come out firing and intense even though it 's a wimbledon final ?
it seems that even as you 've gotten to age 30 you 've improved your serve . how have you done that ? how would you describe your serve as a weapon when you 're at your best ?
and as a weapon , how would you describe it ?
early in the match the crowd appeared to be laughing at some of victoria 's soprano noises . did you notice it or think it was disrespectful at all ?
the centre court crowd have a reputation of being fair and appreciative of good tennis . would you be surprised if they dissolved into laughter of that nature ?
last year you had a great hard court run . the comeback was just getting started . you fell short in the us open . this year you had the clay court run . a lot of people thought you were the favorite for the french ; that fell short . is there something about your experience here that feels different , that gives you confidence to think you can go all the way this time ?
i 'm curious about a statement you made after the last match you were in here . djokovic said the exact same thing . i wonder why athletes say this . ' i had nothing to lose . ' you 're a multigrand slam champ . what do you mean when you say that ?
for somebody who is watching this from afar , not a tennis fan , they see you lose in the first round in the french open and now you 're in the final of wimbledon ; how did you get from there to here ?
when you get this deep in a tournament here , how much does the playing surface change ? have you noticed since the beginning of the tournament till now it 's bouncing differently , especially by the worn patch of grass by the baseline ?
radwanska will become no.1 in the world if she beats you . azarenka will be no.1 in the world if you win . do you think azarenka will be the no.1 just for the computer and not for the public opinion if you win ?
what about you ?
what gives you more satisfaction in a game other than match point ? is it hitting a big passing shot ? cracking a big ace ? what is the most fun and why ?
did she start playing a lot better in the second set ?
what would a 14th major mean to you , especially a fifth here ? that would tie you with venus .
with which man will you be dancing after the finals here ?
who do you think it will be ?
what is the biggest challenge in the finals ? is this an opportunity for you to really use your overpowering skills in this particular matchup ?
you spoke a little while ago about the road from last year . when you think though even before that about the lows that you experienced with your health , what is your enjoyment of this experience and being back in a final after all that you 've been through ?
what was your assessment of the match ?
you know what it 's like to hold up a trophy from the juniors . what do you think it would be like to hold the real one ?
we do n't know for sure who your next opponent will be but serena is up a set and a break in the second set . she seems like the type of player that many other players would fear . when you play her , how do you approach that ?
how do you avoid fearing a player who is so powerful ?
you 've got a lot of experience here . you mentioned the grass . how are the courts this year ? have there been problems ?
how about the bounces ?
do you have any bad bounces ?
any slipping ?
what do you know of jadwiga jedrzejowska ? is that somebody you knew about through your childhood ?
is she somebody you grew up knowing about or not really ? is she famous like fred perry here ?
given the length of time since she did win and the fact that you would be the first polish woman in the open era , what would it mean for you to hold the trophy ?
how important is the chance that you could go for the no.1 ranking ?
what a beast of a day for you . you had to change your warmup strip on the practice courts this morning , then you lose a major semifinal , and then you 're the last player on court and you lose in doubles as well . horrible day for you today .
in the second set you got your teeth into the match . what adjustments did you make and how proud are you of what you were able to do there ?
obviously she served so well , a record number of aces . what is it like to face that ? what makes her serve so difficult ?
there was a point in the second set where you got the break . if it went to a third , did you feel confident it could turn around ?
early part of the season was amazing . are you feeling the early season is taking its toll , or are you still taking a tournament at a time ?
serena thought her intensity dropped a little in the second set . is that a bit unkind or was it your intensity increased ?
is she as good a player as she 's ever been right now ?
early in the match the crowd appeared to be laughing almost at some of the noises you make when you unleash your groundstrokes . did you notice it at all ? did it upset you at all ?
we 've not noticed that happen on centre court here before .
i meant the crowd 's reaction .
the semifinals is a good wimbledon for you . what do you do next ?
who do you like in the final ?
which would give you more pleasure : going to your brother 's wedding or playing in a wimbledon final ?
when you come back for the olympics you can wear what you like . how do you think that affects the prestige of wimbledon ?
how does it feel to dethrone the champion ?
no extra satisfaction then ?
how important was it to put pressure on her right from the very first game today ?
there was the crucial point when she put the volley into the net i think it was at 5all in the second set it a key moment in the game , was n't it ?
going forward now to the semifinal , we do n't know who you 're going to play . if you were to meet azarenka , what sort of game would you expect from her ?
paszek , you beat her at the australian open . what sort of game do you expect from her ?
why do you think you returned serve so well today compared to the last two rounds ?
i 'm sure every time you go to the court to win , but what was your inner voice saying today through the match today ?
you could say that few other players in the game have had more ups and downs than you on the court , injuries , family , romance , everything . the ups , the downs , all the changes , is that something you 're tired of , something you get used to , or does it fire you up ?
in some way do you think ultimately the bad day at the office at paris and the two tough matches here will fire you up for the end run here at wimbledon ?
what are your thoughts on playing under the roof ? how would you describe the differences for you ?
people are saying you 're the favorite for the tournament now . would you agree with that ?
when you talk about the sound , was that the sound of the balls hitting the ground or the crowd ?
can you explain how wimbledon is different this year given you 've got the olympics coming up ?
you were just saying now you have two matches left and you have nothing to lose . have you always played that way , or is this a new frame of mind for you ?
what were the biggest things that you took from the last two matches which were struggles into this where you seemed to elevate your game ?
how did you do that ?
how did that manifest itself on the court in what you did better today ?
what specifically did your team say to you ?
in your postmatch interviews you 've talked about not being at your best . are you confident you will get that back , your best form , one day ?
this is petra 's first time defending a major title . how hard is that to do the first time you do it ?
what 's the hard part about doing that for you ?
why would n't you have calmness of mind ?
can i ask you some numbers , what you think about ? 75 career semifinals out of 153 tournaments ; 5th semifinal in last 10 tournaments ; 21 semifinals in 48 slams . which one is most important to you ?
only just when you win , or also , let 's say semifinals ? federer had an incredible record in the semifinals . just the trophy are important to you or you consider also the semifinals , the finals , or they 're not important ?
that was a very long day , hardfought match . talk about the process of starting , going off , finishing .
she wins the first game when you get back on centre court . are you feeling a little nervous because things can go so quickly before you get rhythm .
whose idea was it to finish the match on centre court ? did you talk between the two of you and request it ?
what are your thoughts about playing kerber ?
what are the differences and similarities between your games ?
what do you think she does best ?
us open last year you went in there playing very well . kerber was not a big name . when you came off the court , were you surprised she beat you ?
it 's taken a while for you to reach your first grand slam semifinal . you 've been asked about it so many times .
how would you describe serena williams ' career and how the other players on the tour look at her ?
do you consider her one of the great players of all the time ?
do you look at this as a very big opportunity now ?
how would you describe playing under the roof ?
your mother came .
she looks very nervous .
she does n't come to too many tennis matches , no ?
does she get more nervous than your father does watching ?
they both get nervous ?
centre court is slower than court no.1 ?
if you could have that match again , is there anything you 'd do differently ?
on set point at 45 there in the second set really a crucial turning point ?
how has it felt being a wimbledon champion here ? has it been difficult , the expectation ? do you find it a happy or difficult experience ?
did you feel under any pressure in this tournament because of that ?
did you sense that serena was particularly keen to beat you because you were the defending champion ? in the buildup she made a few comments she was quite looking forward to playing you because you had the title and we got the sense that she 's very keen to get it back .
do you think she 'll win now ?
when she 's playing this sort of tennis , how would you describe the difficulty in doing anything against her , not just for you but for any of the players ?
how difficult is it for anybody to beat her when she 's playing like this ?
impossible ?
now that your title is gone , how does it feel ? obviously you 're disappointed .
you have an excellent lefthanded serve , and it usually works very well against righthanded players against the backhand . she seemed to hit her backhand very , very well today . is that your impression ?
have you traded in your skoda ?
what did you do with the other car ?
was that as tough as you expected ?
if you lose that today , you must have been thinking as well having lost the eastbourne final from match point up , that would really set you back a bit .
you said sabine stepped up on the match points . do you think that you could have done a little bit more on some of them ? maybe you played a little passively , a little bit percentages against her on those ?
when you were down 54 and you saved your life , what were you thinking ?
so that kind of turned your mind ?
at this moment we do n't know who your next opponent will be . radwanska , what are your thoughts on your comparative styles of game ?
even though you have n't played kirilenko , what impresses you most about the way she plays ?
what was your experience playing under the roof ?
can you explain your last 12 months , your development , your progress .
there were times in the third set where you looked almost sarcastic , smiling when you made mistakes . what was your mental state ?
were you surprised to stay in the set as long as you did ?
you 've been training at a center in frankfurt . i wonder why you chose that one and what larry willens has been able to you ?
is it helpful ?
can you talk a little bit about coming into this tournament where you 're the favorite in a lot of matches which is a difference , whether you like that position ? do you feel like you can beat anyone now if you play your best ?
what are your thoughts on the overall german success at this year 's wimbledon ?
why do you think there are so many good germans now ?
you reached the us open semifinals last year . think about that in comparison to the semifinals here , back in a grand slam semifinal again . compare them .
long day today .
what did you do while you waited ?
( no microphone . )
how would you describe your history playing against serena williams and your thoughts on the match on thursday .
2009 .
what are the qualities in her that make her so tough ?
are you feeling like you 're playing at the same level you did at the beginning of the year ?
you played serena in grand slams and other tournaments . do you sense she 's different while playing in grand slams ?
did you get nervous in the last two service games trying to close it out ?
second match in a row under the roof .
how are the conditions different ?
this is the sixth time you 're going to play serena in a grand slam . do you expect a little more out of yourself ?
if you compare 2008 to 2012 , you 're a better player ?
commentating on your match , tracy austin said sometimes you give the impression of playing against yourself rather than your opponent . do you have a view on that ?
can you talk about that backhand lob and whether it was brilliance or a little bit of luck .
never practiced that shot ?
is it better to be good or lucky ?
they mentioned on tv that all the other courts had stopped play and yours went on . you wanted to finish the match . how wet was it and was it a problem ?
you never had two backtoback really tough matches here en route to the title . is it because the depth of the tour is getting better ?
it was pretty chaotic getting you back to the locker room . how does it feel to have so much support ? does it spur you on in tight matches ?
do you get in any way frighted at all about the situation ? you were literally surrounded .
you said on tv you can play a lot better . i 'm wondering where you feel you 're struggling right now , what is not working for you , and why .
were you aware of richard and venus coming in for the third set ? you seemed to look to them after a couple points and showed real emotion .
he came back in the third set .
your dad was a little concerned that this takes a toll , these matches . you have a difficult one coming up . does it take a cumulative toll on you , these tough matches ?
do you ever feel that your opponent hesitates or experiences that she hesitates in the closing stages of the match because of your charisma or status ?
do you think wimbledon have to take into account security issues like what you experienced today for future scheduling ?
were you frightened ?
do you think someone else could get injured ?
serena , at this point in the tournament the pressure builds . what is your personal approach to pressure ?
when you face petra , how much will last year 's match be on your mind ?
i 'm sorry , two years ago .
are you frustrated about being put on court2 again ?
you do n't think you 're being targeted because you 've not engaged with the tour ?
not gone to all the events that others have gone to and got the ranking , for example .
do you enjoy the battle , the physical , emotional , mental strain ?
the loss in paris , obviously that kind in thing does not happen to you very often . so you come in here and have tough battles . does it make you hungrier when you come in ?
far away from today 's match , if you were back in l.a. as a casting director , who would you like to have play you in the movies and venus ?
are you somebody that can play your way out in a bad loss and put it out in mind , or do you have to do other things to get a loss out in your system ?
when she won the first point in the first set , were you worried about another golden set ?
is the spillover effect from the french open done now ?
they 're doing away with one of the biggest traditions of wimbledon , wearing all white for the olympics . are you going to go wild or do you think it will be weird ?
if you had to step back and describe your confidence right now , how would you express it ?
how frustrating was it and how crucial was the first set ?
was her serving very well ? was that the key point ?
were you surprised because you were coming in feeling very good and she just played well , or was it because you played a long french open and you were n't quite feeling yourself the last couple of weeks ?
you mentioned the level of her game today . in general , what are your thoughts on the place she might take among the top players , yourself included ?
beyond the serve , what do you consider the best parts of her game ?
was there a turning point in this game when you started to realize it was going to get tough today ?
could you step back for a moment and talk about the european swing , stuttgart , rome , paris , then the loss here .
is the roland garroswimbledon back to back as tough a challenge in women 's tennis as anything ?
you talk about the motivation you would take out of here . how would the possible loss of the top ranking that you have worked your way into play into that ?
what were the main differences in her game from when you played in melbourne ?
is it tougher to win wimbledon today than it was when you last won it ?
do you think there 's more players perhaps that might be able to catch a hot day ?
was today one of those days where you said it does n't matter how hard you fight , change strategy , if the quality does n't come , she 's going to get you anyway ?
last week with nadal 's loss there was plenty of discussion on the depth on the men 's tour where on any day any top 100 player could beat one of the best . what are your thoughts on the lessons about the depth on the women 's tour ?
it seemed to be going so well for you , and you got distracted by the weather . is that fair ?
were you surprised that the umpire did n't stop it ?
did you make that point to her ?
do you think it was dangerous out there ?
what did the umpire say back to you ? did she just refuse or say , we have to wait for five minutes ?
the crowd seemed a bit unhappy . did you understand that ?
but it must have showed the strength of your feeling , because it was a crucial time in the second set when you made the point , you know .
well , basically that you had nothing to gain by moaning , really , that you could have , you know ...
did you , in the third set then , was it still on your mind , all those issues ? the weather had n't really improved that much . the third set was very different from the first two sets .
you must be annoyed and disappointed , though .
i do n't know the rules . are you able to complain to the referee to ask when you have a disagreement with the umpire in some of the conditions ?
were you surprised that there did n't seem to be anything happening or changing , that nobody was making a decision in that regard , that the referee was n't coming to make a final decision ?
do you know why you were sitting on the seats for so long and stayed on the side of the court ?
you should have left , you think ?
did you ask if you could leave ?
and you were told no ?
did that seem slightly silly sitting there waiting because there is no cover on the court and the rain is coming down ?
finally got the umbrellas .
did you hear the umpire call second set , as well , at one point ? she made a mistake ?
do you think without that problem you could have won the game because you were going well ?
what would you like to see done in future so that nobody else suffers like you did ?
you either play or not play , not just sit there waiting to see if ...
because it 's not unusual rain in england , really .
what are your thoughts on reaching the next round and on the match that you had today ?

was it your game plan to be aggressive right from the very start ?
did you have any indication how well it would go for you today ?
no nerves ?
at what point of the match did you realize that the match was yours , that maria was not coming back ?

can you describe your thoughts on facing someone from your home country in the next round .
is there any reason that you ca n't win this tournament ?
the commentators were complimentary about the power of your groundstrokes . do you consider yourself to be one of the hardest hitters on the tour ?
it all looks great , you 're happy , the dialogue is going well . you had a lot of trouble with injuries and it 's been a long way back for you , has n't it ?

were you surprised when she started moaning ?
when the umpire asked if you wanted to carry on , you said yes ?
you seemed to be a bit grumpy with the weather or yourself and after stormed to victory .
do you feel your opponent lost concentration because of the break and the worry about the weather ?
talk about the first two sets , what a big fight and struggle it was . she seemed to be playing at a high level and you were looking for your game a lot .

the first time you played serena in australia , do you remember that match ?
i wo n't talk about the score . at that point you were maybe too immature and she was such a big player that you could n't really find your game . di you think of her as someone way up there and you were n't ready to play her ?
yes .
so now i 'm assuming you 're at the level , defending champion , you have a different feeling when you 're facing someone like her ?
do you think being the defending champion helps you to embrace the pressure that 's coming on now in the second week ?
what 's the best thing about pressure and what 's the worst thing about it ?

what were your thoughts on the person who beat you today and her future in this tournament ?
she plays lisicki next . what do you make of that match ?
what was the punchline to the story you were telling about your dad sitting there ?

does she have any sense how special wimbledon is ?
can you tell us about the pigeon .
quite a few feathers . must have given it a bash .
how would you describe the way you 're playing right now .
can you give a little bit of a review of your next match , somebody you 've played a couple times . what are your thoughts on the challenges she presents ?

you find it very good , dropping only 13 games .

your feel and rhythm , do you feel like you 're playing at a top level again ?
what are your thoughts about the quarters ?
how important is it to keep your head down and focus on what you 're doing ? you can get caught up with the big streak , all the attention on you , you slip a little bit . seems like it 's got to be important to focus on your own self ?
of the surfaces , where would you rank grass in terms of how much you like it ?
do you get on it and feel like it 's fun and different or that you really have to make more adjustments than you would on others ?
what is the best part of pressure and what 's the worst part of pressure ?
the wta made their announcement on limiting sounds in the future . do you think that is something fair , that they can possibly implement ?

you have a chance to get no.1 back at this tournament . looking back at the months you were no.1 , was it an enjoyable experience or a little bit difficult at times ?
the difficulty was having the other players targeting you more because you were at the top ?
can you imagine yourself holding the trophy on saturday ?
if you could just take us through the match .
it was a very exciting final set . you must be so disappointed that you were n't able to just finish it off .
serena gave you a big compliment . she said that you always give her a tough match and that you 're playing unbelievable . she said `` unbelievable on grass . ''
what can you learn from playing against a player like serena ?
you must feel that your performance here gives you a lot of confidence for the olympics when you come back .
how deep did you have to dig there ?
new wimbledon record for aces .
did you think your serve was going to carry you through there ?
is it a matter of gaining confidence ? do you have to regain the belief in yourself ?
your next opponent won the golden set , 24 points in a row . you do n't have that yet . does that impress you or does that scare you maybe ? think it 's cool ?
did you notice dustin hoffman turning up in your family area during the match ? was it a distraction at all ?
you did ?
have you spoken to him before today ?
you spoke a bit about your serve . what were the other things you thought were the cause of the struggles in the first set and that turned things around as the match went on ?
what turned it around in your game ? what was the important aspect that you picked up your game in ?
second very long match . was there anything you learned from the one you did n't win ?
with dustin , what do you like about the guy ?
interesting results this week . wozniacki , stosur , nadal ; you were taken to the limits . roger taken to the limits . any idea or anything you 're seeing with the grass different ?
the leap you took after match point was up there .
what were you feeling ?
gut check match for you ?
did you get any roses after your appeal the last day ? if you could get roses from any guy on the planet , who would it be ?
have you ever come close to a golden set ?
you have doubles scheduled later . how do you prepare physically for that ?
having been tested this much in this match , how much might it help you for week two ?
will you tomorrow just relax , go shopping ? you 're somebody that likes to do stuff .
who will you support ?
did you watch the nadal/rosol match the other night ? if so , what were your thoughts ?
what did you think of the way that guy performed at that level in the fifth set ?
there 's been ongoing discussion about women 's and men 's tennis having equal pay . what is your comment ?
this discussion that is popping up once again , is it saddening ? does it bother you ?
centre court today was pretty much packed . court18 was packed for your doubles . what do you think that says to the conversation about payment ?
did we just overhear you say that you were in such a zone you did n't even realize you had n't lost a point in the first set ?
( off microphone . ) the match with isner and mahut , did you think it was like something like this on court 3 now after this match ?
are we under the impression you did it once before or came very close once before to doing this and double faulting ?
memphis ? you won 23 straight points in a row once before . 2007 do n't remember that ? do n't remember that at all ?
since you found out , have you and errani spoken about this at all ?
but still you played a perfect set in the end , and it 's almost never happened before . it 's happened once with a man . so did it feel in any way different ? did you feel like you were playing in a zone or anything ? or not really ? it just felt like normal tennis to you ?
but you have had that feel before on court , right ? that was normal , right ?
so this perfect thing happened and it did n't feel much different to you ?
talk to us about the conditions out there . seemed like the sun was in your eye a lot . it was windy out . what was it like out there ?
you have been working with a new trainer since last year . can you tell us something about the relationship and if you think you have improved your game ?
on that secondserve ace that you had , what made you go for it ?
do you know that you had a secondserve ace ?
yeah .
emiliano said that you guys had a game plan and that you really followed it in the first set . is that easy for you to follow , you know , a plan ?
you had great success , you know . you had two grand slams with vania . how does it feel ? this experience been helping you to play a player that was just in the finals of the roland garros ?
you also showed like tremendous confidence when you play . like you have this aura around you , very focused . how do you keep , you know , your concentration for the match ?
emiliano said that also like you work very hard , and you 're always ready to work . you have great work ethic . is that important that you keep that ?
did you , before today , know that a golden set existed ?
i mean , you never heard players talk about it at all ?
so what does it feel like to have done it ? you may or may not know , but no woman has done that before . that 's history . it 's a historic moment . it 's one of the great moments . it 's one of the things to remember from these championships . what does that feel like ?
considering all that can go wrong in a set , all the ways you could lose a point , are you surprised ? are you amazed ?
but it sounds like you feel as if you 've played better sets in your life . have you played better sets of tennis than this first set today , do you think ? forget the score . where you felt , oh , i really played .
i understand .
i was just wondering if there were other times you felt you played even better than today . was this the highest level you think you 've ever played in a set ? you think back , oh , no , i remember when i played one set against x or y , it was much better ?
you have always been very good and everything , but in roland garros , you almost had like a breakthrough when you played really well . do you think you 're bringing the same type of game to wimbledon ? you are golden , right ? but how does it translate being here ?
do you consider yourself a momentum player ?
someone who once they get going , they 're hard to stop , and if they 're going in the other direction , it 's hard to turn around .
no , but i mean in a match when you start to win a lot of points , you 're hard to stop once you get going .
can i ask you about that ? you win the set 6love . you go down the early break . a lot of people look at that with the women 's game of tennis in general , when you win a set like that , is it tough to maintain in terms of the concentration ? because you often see when people win a set 6love , then it happens they fall a break down , is it tougher to do that , to maintain your focus that you had obviously throughout the first set ?
you won li na in paris with great confidence , play very good . how do you think it 's possible to stay in this same concentration for the next match with serena ?
congratulations . good win today . how do you describe that performance ?
you have the record for consecutive grand slam appearances . is that something that you hope to keep going for some time yet , a number of grand slams ?
i do n't know the number exactly right now .
and so you hope to be out there for a long time , then ?
you could come up against petra next round . could you talk about that ?
wimbledon , where does that rate for you ? how much do you enjoy being here ?
what was the problem ?
how long have you had that problem ?
you could see on tv you could n't contain your emotions . was it the fact you were on centre court and your illness was stopping you playing ?
how much did it actually affect you when you were playing ?
what happened after the match ? have you seen a doctor ?
how do you feel now ?
it 's always going to be hard , a player a hundred places ahead of you .
you were getting more challenges on her serve early on , were n't you ?
we 've seen you cry in the past . we 've seen you over the moon . how are you now ?
you 're obviously aware the whole nation was rooting for you . the centre court crowd today were fantastic . put in words what it feels like to have that groundswell of people rooting for you .
do you feel pressure or maybe future responsibility ? has n't been since 1977 and virginia wade that a british woman won a grand slam title . are you able to divorce that all from your thinking ?
what are your plans now ?
that 's definitely going ahead , is it ?
not going up to manchester ?
a lot of people have said your style is quite similar to radwanska 's . is there something you can learn from the way her career has gone and become a better player ?
you have the olympics coming up . is that a chance for you to end the summer on a high end and prove to people how you can play ?
you had a fantastic wimbledon and you wo n't let this defeat spoil your memory . what has been the best memory ?
you won 30 odd grand . are you going to buy yourself something nice to celebrate ?
what do you think you 're going to buy yourself ?
salmon ?
it seemed like you tried to take the pace off of the ball the end of the first set . what was the thinking behind that ?
are you confident you can breach that gap and get into the top 100 ?
she 's 23 and she 's got a lot more experience than you . do you think you can bridge that gap since you 're on an upward curve ? do you think you can do that now ?
how difficult did you find the wind today ?
did you ever recall a serve before where the ball bounced before it got to the net ?
did you see any of the men 's match last night ?
what is your reaction ?
do you think it 's harder as a player to take a loss like that when it 's not expected ?
i 'm sorry to have to ask this question . i 'm sure you get peppered with these questions all the time , but it 's relevant because the opponent you play on monday , lisicki she moaned about her secondround opponent , jovanovski , based on the amount of noise she made across the net . the noise was toned down . in a similar situation , would you talk to the umpire ? would you even react to it ? have you been in that situation before ?
are you progressing through the tournament ?
i wanted to ask about your opponent today . it was the first time she played on no.1 court . were there elements of her game that surprised you ?
are you eager to wipe out your reputation as a clay court specialist ?
two weeks ago .
how has the transition been to grass , and how are you thinking now that you 've mastered really all surfaces ?
( no microphone . )
it looked like a tough encounter for you out there .
obviously there is a comparison to be made with the williams sisters . she 's touted as the next big thing . how would you make that comparison ?
can i just ask about in your last game not this one but the last one against jovanovski you made a complaint to the umpire about her noise . you 've got maria in the next round who is obviously fairly noisy . will that feature at all in your plans ? i know you have played her before and last year at the semifinal , but clearly it 's offputting for you .
does it put you off , the noise from the other side of the net on a regular basis , or is it just ...
what were you thinking when you were down 52 in that tiebreaker in the first set ? was all hope lost ?
can you describe what the challenge is when you play against maria sharapova ?
what are the mental and physical challenges given how well she has been playing lately ?
what do you remember about when she won here ? did you watch it on tv ? when she won the championship here years ago , do you remember seeing it on tv ? do you have any memories of that ?
you were up in the second set in the semifinal last year . did it take a lot to come back from that sort of disappointment ? you did have a chance last year .
in those tight matches with her , what has been the slight difference , do you think ?
what did you make of sloane ? she 's an upandcoming potential star . how do you think she played ? third set she missed a few grounds but the first two sets she played very well .
do you think she 's got , in terms of her future , a bright future ahead of her ?
if you watched it last night , what were your thoughts watching the way the nadal match unfolded ?
next round , radwanska , no.3 ranking , it 's a big challenge ?
not the way you want to win a match , but how happy were you with the way you were playing ?
can you say a few words about your next opponent now , angelique ?
at this stage of the tournament , are you happy to have the twoday break ?
did you have a chance to watch the nadal match last night ?
what were your thoughts as that was unfolding ?
how do you explain when a guy hits rockets like that ?
where are you with your injury ?
back to kerber , you said it 's fun to play a new player . it 's also wimbledon , she 's been playing great , you have n't played her before , so there 's a danger element to it .
the nadal match , they decided to close the roof a the end of the fourth set because the light was dimming . seemed to affect his momentum . should they have closed the roof ? do you know what the policy is ?
takes a long time for it to close .
with nadal out , there 's the focus on andy murray . you 've been coming here for quite a while and seen the attention to andy murray . what are your thoughts about how it might be now with nadal out ?
what are your observations as to how he 's dealt with this all these years ?
how do you feel about your chances heading into the second week ?
coming in here , how would you rate your preparation and confidence level ?
kim , have you got any words of encouragement for the young heather watson ?
if everything holds up , what will be your last tournament ?
are you counting down the days or just sort of trying to enjoy day to day and not thinking about the finish line ?
are you attempting to soak up things every day because it will be your last time here ?
ten aces . very happy with it ?
you 're mentioned as one of the favorites . the americans keep disappearing the first couple days . do you feel a pressure to produce for the country as well as yourself ? what is it like being in that situation ?
how are you feeling physically in this tournament ? it seems like maybe you 're not stressed , but there 's a lot going into every game , every match , and you 're not yet at your loosest .
sloane and christina are both in this tournament . can you talk about them as players and people .
as players , can you talk about their upsides a little bit ?
do they look up to you more for tennis advice or life advice ?
gilles simon called for the end of equal prize money . maria sharapova was asked about it . she said the struggle was a long one that not many people supported . she added that a lot more people watch her matches than simon 's . could you comment on that .
how far are you off your peak ?
you looked a bit down today .
i heard you were one of the most romantic players on the tour . i wondered what someone could do to cheer you up at the moment ?
what do you think about the grunting debate ?
the women 's tennis association has said they 're trying to phase it out . what do you think about that approach ?
what flowers do you like ?
you wo n't be able to move there will be that many people sending you roses .
off the flowers for a second , do you consider serving first in a final set to be an advantage or not ? if so , why ?
looking at the men 's side of the tour where the three men have dominated the last slams for several years , what have you gained by watching them ?
a not particularly convincing start in your earlyround matches . is that because you 're adjusting to the grass or is it something else ?
looking at the draw , you knew it would be difficult because she did so well here last year .
how do you turn it on and off so fast going from the second set breaker , which clearly was n't your best tennis . what were you thinking when you were down ?
you have a pretty impressive record in third sets . do you think it 's an advantage to be starting first going into that set ? and if so , why ?
what did you specifically change in the third set ?
i 'm from sweden and curious about your journey together with thomas hogstedt . could you describe that a little bit , please ?
unlike the women 's side of things where there have been so many champions in the grand slams the last several years , on the men 's side it 's been three guys winning 28 of the last 29. what sense of appreciation do you have for what djokovic , nadal , and federer have done ?
there 's been a report recently about adopting a system to measure the noise when players hit the ball . is there something you can do to your technique to reduce the noise that you make ?
you played a shot yesterday with your left hand .
gilles simon has made a comment about the equal pay issue . wondering what your feelings are on those comments .
you 're an americanbased , russian coached by a swede . do you know anything about cricket ?
one of the world 's best cricketers has declared a crush on you .
your response to that victory ? you played well in the first set .
you mentioned your back . is that a problem at the moment ?
has it been a problem ? you had injuries this year .
the first couple matches , building from last year 's success , are you feeling that confidence coming through you and you can repeat that success ?
does it feel different coming back as the champion ? do you have the pressure ?
gilles simon suggested he felt the men should be paid more than the women . what is your response ?
he said the men 's game is more entertaining than the women 's game . would you disagree with that ?
tough opponent , but were you disappointed with your own performance ?
have you any idea why you were n't up to your best ?
you started very slowly . is there any particular reason for that ? were you nervous out there ?
was the wind a factor at all ?
you would have been aware obviously of heather 's win on the same court yesterday at the same time . did that impact at all on how you approached the game ?
you 're going to be back here in a few weeks ' time . does that fill you with excitement ?
is playing for your country very different to representing yourself , as it were ?
what are you going to do in the time between now and the olympics ?
when will you get back then ?
did you reconsider that ? was that always going to be the plan , or did you think about it once you got there ?
do you get to stay in the olympic village and be part of the opening ceremony ?
where do you feel like your game is at the moment ?
you say that you 're super pumped up for the olympics .
forgive me , but you looked a little bit flat today at the start . is that just my impression ? were you not super pumped up for wimbledon ?
do you have any superstitions you follow on the court or on the day you 're playing ?
we spoke to the wta chief executive earlier today about the grunting and noise reduction . they 're implementing a system mainly at a junior level to educate . what is your take on the whole thing ?
you looked to have won your serve before you actually did . what was that point when the umpire intervened ? could you explain that ?
the point was reversed , was it ?
you seemed to get a lot more momentum after you held . do you think if that would n't have happened you would have got on to challenge a bit more ?
as many matches as you 've played , when you 're 6love , 4love , are you actually thinking about lovelove , or are you thinking about fighting back and ...
do you remember the last time you got bageled ?
how much was a distraction of court 1 , moved to court 2 , and the sun was going down ?
when the set starts running away from you like the first one , how difficult is it to stop it disappearing ?
you 'll be playing in a few weeks here . does that make it feel any different ?
almost compensating for the defeat today , knowing it 's not the end of wimbledon for the year ?
you have had a few problems with injuries in the last few years , and have you ever sort of wondered how many more times you will be sort of coming back here ?

simon has said women should n't be paid the same as men . wondering what you think of that ?
the example he gave was rome became a joint tournament , and he remembered a women 's final where 20 spectators showed up . you would n't say that 's a fair reflection ?
do you think it 's offensive , though ?
was there a particular thing in arantxa 's game today that gave you the most trouble ?
it 's been a disappointing tournament for australian players . any particular reason , or just one of those situations with draws and players not playing their best ?

but personally , having won three sets this year , which is three more than last year , what can you take away as something you learned from this experience ?
between now and the olympics , what are your plans ?
arantxa already enjoys her reputation for knocking out giants . how would you characterize that ?
how conscious were you of that ugly stat about the australian men that was floating around yesterday ? did that have any impact on you ? did you feel extra pressure to carry the australian flag ?

she said that she thought you took a long time between points .
the injury break at the end of the first set , did that affect you at all in terms of your rhythm and concentration ?

what do you know about the olympics coming up ?
do you think it would feel different ? how do you think it would feel to represent britain if that were to happen ?
it was a tough match . you went down a break right away . you were fighting a lot . at the end of the match you played much better . it almost felt that you were n't believing . you 're in the beginning of a third set and you still have a chance . what was going on at that moment ?
what were you most pleased with in your match today about your game ?
you 're such a great fighter . you had the tough match with maria sharapova . did it cross your mind at any point during the match today ? did you think about that match ?
yes .
are you playing mixed doubles here ?
you were very young when you started playing . you seem to have developed into a very wellrounded athlete now . has there been anything in particular you 've been doing to work on your athleticism ?
was it very offputting when the rain came near the end ?
what happened at the start of the game ? you seemed to struggle .
is it very difficult coming back as the defending champion this year ?
what a day . a win and confirmation for the olympics . were there any tears from you ?
and the win today ?
five brits in the second round . does n't always happen .
laura had a tough match and fought hard at the end . you 're close . does it give you an incentive to go out there and win your match to represent britain ?
is there any advantage that she has to play tomorrow , errani ?
she 's got match point .
( question off mic . )
it 's good we 've got five in the second round . do you think it would be real a statement of intent if we could have two or three more in the third as well ?
elena has petra .
judy murray has a new role with the fed cup . she has a lot of experience . has she added new things to your game ?
happy girl ?
you did n't know till she told you that ?
can you tell us what that wildcard means .
so last night what was weighing on your mind ? this match was weighing on your mind and that ?
can you describe the moments after the match , how you were told , and exactly what the conversation was , please .
( off microphone . )
you said about the neck thing , is it fair to say it 's been a difficult few weeks ?
the tears were tears of frustration and all that ?
when you look back at the photos and the video of the moment you were told by judy murray , what do you think you 'll feel in your head and your heart ?
petra kvitova is up next . you think that 's going to be on centre court ?
can you remind us if you 've played there much before , what do you feel about possibly being on that court ?
have you found this is a place that 's lifted you in the past because of the crowd support , or it has actually daunted you ?
and quite a way to end your career possibly . i know you 've said in the past this might be your final year .
what do you remember your feelings were when you watched either in person or on tv when kvitova won last year and was celebrating in the post match ?
you had some treatments . what was the problem ?
how frustrating has it been to be on court and not feel the rhythm you like to have ?
as someone who has experienced the joys and thrills of winning here and walking off with those emotions , how would you describe what you 're feeling today ?
is it tough , though ? this is the place you 've had your most success . to find yourself out in the first round , how do you deal with it ? your health , how are you feeling ?
it was quite sad seeing you walk back through the crowds . how difficult was that walk for you ?
how would you assess your career now and the future of your career ?
and you think you can go on on the circuit for a good while ?
what was your energy level like today on the court ? how did you feel with the energy ?
you said earlier this year that you came back earlier than you might have done normally because of the need to get rankings points to qualify for the olympics . do you think in any way that you 're paying for that now ?
were you able to get enough work in between roland garros and here maybe practicewise , fitnesswise , and do you feel like you had your rhythm back overall ?
and rhythmwise ?
will we see venus back at wimbledon ?
next year ?
you mention the olympics . what will this olympic experience mean to you , and how do you look upon the olympics in general ?
in general , what are your thoughts on your olympic experiences ?
given your olympic ambitions that you clearly stated , what do we expect ? do we see you before the olympics ? do you have a game plan formulated for how you 're going to prepare for that ?
just work out ?
so many wonderful memories here at wimbledon . if you had to choose one , which would that be ?
obviously you 've been very open that the olympics was a major goal . what is going to drive you after that ? you 're 32 , struggling , have a lot of other interests .
a little bit . no ?
to win matches ?
i 'm just asking what 's going to drive you to stay with it after the olympics .
would you consider this the hardest part of your career , five or six tournaments back , what you 've had to go through the last year and a half or so off court ?
is the biggest victory to be back after all you 've been through ?
a lot of people in this sport have to deal with injuries and illnesses . is there anybody in the past that has been inspirational how they 've been able to fight back from something ?
where do you find all this positivity that you talk about ?
best win ? best performance ?
like graveyard watch ?
4 out of the 20 breakpoints you took .
how much do you think of things , you know , from the lucie win ? you have beaten a much higherranked player .
how long before the match did you find out you were going on centre ?
and it was good not to have too much time to think about being on centre .
how did you find it on centre , the crowd ?
how did it compare to the way you imagined it to be ?
but was it bigger ? smaller ? did something feel different ?
is there a sense of relief to get through the first round ? you tend to attract attention . now it 's a sense of refocusing .
have you played her before ?
result ?
johanna konta was 7all in the third set with mchale .
yeah .
how much contact have you had with johanna ? do you think it 's good to have her in the mix amongst the british players now ?
in roland garros you had a very good win against vesnina . does it give you more confidence when something like that happens ?
laura overtook you in the rankings recently . did she say anything to you when she had done that ? is that a goal for you to overtake her ?
did you speak to tara wallace about that ?
you mentioned that you wanted to be more aggressive . is that a decision you made yourself or talking to the guys that help you ?
would you describe your thoughts about today 's match against venus williams .
you mentioned you 've always thought highly of venus and serena . what was the atmosphere like on the court , and what were you thinking about venus as you were playing against her ?
is it hard to block out all the titles she 's won here when you 're playing someone like that on the court ?
have you been able in the past , when you played top players like serena , to block it out , not think about that ?
venus gave you much credit for playing a great match . how did you feel her energy level was ?
what is your favorite surfaces ?
how often in singles matches do you serve and volley ?
how often on grass do you do it ?
it 's wimbledon , first round . you seem so confident . where do you draw this confidence ? because you like grass ?
how would you describe the challenge you have now for your next match ?
what carries over from your success today for that next match ?
do you have any particular memory of venus playing here that you watched ?
did today 's match go according to your plan or did you change your plan ?
what does venus williams mean to you and to the sport ?
you expect to see her thriving again ?
how was that for you today ?
how do you find the surface and the atmosphere ?
how is it to be back this year ?
do you consider your comeback complete now , and this is a new stage now that you got the grand slam title you were looking for ?
so after paris , you smiled a lot , and now you 're thinking about wimbledon and you 're thinking , okay , next stage now . this is sort of behind me and now i have to plan for something new ?
what do you think about the plans to extend the time from the end of the roland garros to the beginning of wimbledon , maybe an extra week to adjust to the grass ?
what was the one or two toughest moments in the stretch of your comeback ?
this is the first time here coming off having won the french . what 's different about that , if anything , as you conduct yourself and progress at wimbledon ?
when you come here every year , do you still think about 2004 ?
when you see your picture , do you say , that was just a young girl then ; she did n't know what she was doing ?
what has been the most surprising thing since you won roland garros ?
how does that airline compare with southwest ?
did people recognize you or ask you to hold their babies ?
was it much harder than you think the scoreline suggested ?
was she much affected by the injury , do you think ?
you have not made a semifinal in any grand slam . do you think you can here this time ?
can you just tell me how you feel about winning today after some disappointments the last couple of months ?
how did you find that court ?
you , of course , have come from nowhere before when you came out of your retirement with little play and went on to win the us open . does a part of you think that you can come out of nowhere and take wimbledon ?
you seemed almost relieved after winning .
can you talk about the last 14 months ?
you 've retired before . coming back , it 's a little bit more planned or thought out . does it make it easier or harder when you come back to these places and the tournaments ?
you faced some injuries this year . how important is it for your game winning in straight sets ?
what kind of rehab did you have to do ? ultrasound ?
so it was a small tear ?
any=d discomfort today or not ?
it was the women 's match that everybody was looking forward to . it was a tough draw . how did you feel when you found out you were playing her ?
is it true you 're not playing in between the olympics and the us open ?
you have n't decided ?
you 're looking at here , olympics , us open . do you feel you need more matches going into new york ?
is your family here with you ? is your daughter realizing it 's your farewell tour ?
you looked like you had more problems with the wind today than before .
sum up your week here for us .
you take a lot of positives out of it ?
eight games in eight days . you only have to play seven games to win wimbledon . were you tired today ?
is it the adrenaline that 's keeping you going ?
so tell us about your mindset now . you are obviously meeting sloane . how are you going to approach ?
have you played each other a lot ?
so it 's even ?
what advice was your coaching giving you when he came onto the courts ?
will you come back again to eastbourne ?
even if they make you play through a cloud ?
just the sort of workout you needed before wimbledon ?
did the short break at 54 make any difference to you ?
when you came out to serve for the match .
the weather today seemed to affect your game quite a bit .
there were 14 breaks of serve today , 8 on your serve . was your serve giving you some struggles ?
was it more because of the wind then ?
overall , how are you feeling ahead of wimbledon ? decent week here . a few matches after a tough clay season ?
what is it about eastbourne that keeps you coming back ?
will you come back next year ?
have you seen the wimbledon draw ?
have you had a chance to get out of the hotel and look around eastbourne ?
have you had the chance to go out of the hotel and look around eastbourne ?
any particular favorite places you like to go to ?
are you heading back to london today ?
wish you well for wimbledon .
your allaround game looks to be in pretty good shape .
there was that moment of course in the second set with the line judge . what exactly happened there ?
but you reacted with quite some venom after that first set by winning that second set 6love ?
what was it you actually said to the line judge ? because there was stuff flying around on twitter that you said she just wanted to feel important , the line judge . is that what you said ?
have you spoken to the line judge since ?
you 've not played jamie , i understand , since juniors . do you remember ?
she said she played you when she was a junior .
do you know much about her ? have you had a chance to watch her play ?
what is it about here that you 're so successful ?
no , you , eastbourne , why do you think it 's a good tournament for you ?
she played pretty well against you , did n't she ?
you had a couple of slips . did that affect you at all ?
a bit of a weird week in eastbourne because bartoli pulled out so you only really played two matches .
did you get enough preparation this week ?
when you 're kind of in and out of the match , can you realize it 's happening during the match , or is it something you only realize afterwards ?
( question about being in and out of the match . )
do you feel in a better place now than you were after the french open ? you had that trip home and now you 're here .
how confident are you going into next week ?
what do you like about wimbledon ?
less running ?
were you able to watch wimbledon when you were growing up , playing tennis as a junior ? did they have wimbledon on in china ?
did you find it to be a weird idea to play tennis on grass when you saw it ?
are you going to get back to london in time for the player party tonight ?
you ran that pretty close .
how does it feel to be the first american in 10 years to reach the semis here ?
capriati , 2003. the last one .
were you surprised with yourself this week ?
you seemed a little bit tense at times . did you sort of feel it with the conditions and the like ?
your ball toss seemed to trouble you a little bit , as well , at times .
why were you more amped up today than other matches prior ?
is this the closest you are to your first singles title ?
what did you make of the conditions out there today ? were they okay ? we have had a few mixed verdicts whether it was too wet .
you 're playing well at the minute . is this your best tennis you have come across ?
you 're up to the no.3 american when the rankings come out on monday .
yeah . you 'll be behind serena and sloane . thoughts on that and kind of what your year has been like to get there . you do n't have that much to defend over the summer , either .
what about being the no.1 american ?
do you get distracted by some of the weird sounds coming from the stand , like echoing sneezes and sounds of bubonic plague sweeping across eastbourne ?
how are you with kind of when play kind of starts and stops or when there is rain delays . i know in terms of your warmup it can kind of cause issues , and that 's going to be something that comes up , you know , especially at wimbledon . is it ever kind of a stress for you to kind of keep your body warm and your back loose when the schedule kind of gets a little wonky ?
what kind of guidance were you looking for from your coach today he was out a couple times ?
talk about your next match . you could play either caroline or makarova , so obviously two very different players in terms of how to approach that .
do you watch a lot of caroline like on tv ?
how much of a different game was it today compared to your meeting at the french ?
obviously you have been sort of that teenager coming up and you know how hard it is . where do you think her game is right now ?
looking forward to next week , do you see laura as more of a challenge on grass ? she played better against you today than she did last month ?
would you say it was comfortable for you today in terms of the victory ?
just a case of winning those games at the right time obviously , because it was 4all in both sets and then you went and broke ?
do you find it difficult to find against home crowds ? obviously there was a lot of support for laura ?
you face katarina makarova tomorrow . how do you approach that ?
and also it 's the wta 's 40th anniversary this year . what are your whole thoughts on the celebration ?
that 's something that 's echoed throughout the locker room , is it ?
i guess the first thing is was it a good day physically ?
do you feel that 's happening , or do you realize that 's happening , the loss of focus ?
obviously we have talked a lot about the glandular fever and the effects . is that still an effect of that or was that just ...
was there a reason for the lack of focus ? anything you can put your finger on ?
are they getting less frequent ?
do you do anything with a sports psychologist ? ever talk to him about that ?
do you have any sort of techniques you go through out on court or anything to ...
do you think you have enough matches under your belt going into next week ?
what about the draw on friday ? will you be following that very closely ?
what 's your schedule for the rest of the week now ? what will you be doing ?
are you going up to wimbledon ?
any players you want to avoid on the draw friday ?
your thoughts on that match .
when we were in paris you were saying you were working piecemeal on bits of your serve . have you seen any improvement since coming back ?
you seemed the more attacking player out of the two of you out there . was that the game plan , to try to take the game to her ?
what can you take out of this week going into next week at wimbledon ?
was there anything today that you thought that caroline did that made it difficult for you especially ?
when you play caroline , obviously she 's so good defensively . do you feel a little bit of extra pressure to put those balls away that sit up ? does it put a bit more pressure on you because she 's so good at getting them back ?
would you have hoped for a different opponent ?
obviously emotions run high . i have to ask , the bbc microphones picked up you swearing on court . do you have anything to say ?
again i have to ask , people said that were obviously watching , they said that you rushed off and did n't sign any autographs afterwards .
you 've played a lot of big players on big courts now in the last year , so in terms of the draw next week , would you be very happy to avoid one of the big names on the big courts and have a slightly more comfortable path at the beginning ?
that must be very encouraging , the fact that your end points , the way you 're dictating the points , yet you did n't put away the final shot today but you 're in that position ?
do you ever sometimes think , wow , i 'm one of the top 50 or whatever players in the world ?
is the overriding emotion frustration now after that ? you were ahead in each set , and then is it frustration what you feel now ?
yeah .
possibly looking a little too far ahead , you have wimbledon to contend with , you were so close to get a seeding . is the goal now to get a seeding for the us open , or you just take it as it comes ?
you probably would prefer to get more match practice than have a walkover ?
you went out and practiced ?
that 's not as good as a match , is it ?
how can this tournament help your game leading up to wimbledon ?
it in terms of being at wimbledon , what would be a good tournament for you in terms of how far you get ?
yeah .
can you see yourself winning the tournament ?
how have you been spending your time in eastbourne apart from practicing and winning matches ?
you always go to the same place ?
you do n't try fish and chips ?
when he 's not watching ?
how do you find eastbourne as a place to play tennis ? obviously it 's different being away from somewhere like london . it 's quite quiet here .
have you had much time to go around town and go along the pier or on the seafront ?
you must have been very pleased with the way you played today .
first set and a half you must have thought you were going to win it ?
perfect preparation for next week ?
if you draw a top10 player , i guess you wo n't be thinking `` oh , no , '' anymore ?
except one or two ?
there will be one or two who wo n't fancy playing you perhaps ?
well , the way you 're playing ...
has your confidence sort of risen by the fact your movement is you 've improved a lot certainly since you have come back . that has played a huge difference ?
do you think you 're more ready for this wimbledon than you ever have been in the past ?
mentally you 're in a better place , though , are n't you ?
i certainly think you 're better than you were two years ago .
where you are ?
this year marks the 40th anniversary of the battle of the sexes game . reflect on that . how important has it been on your career ?
yeah .
potentially a difficult match for you , but it worked out in the end ?
how is your confidence at the moment ? it 's fair to say you have n't had the best run of results recently ?
how long have you been able to practice on the court , and how are you feeling on it right now ?
is it just a matter of doing like drills , whether it 's movement or things like that , or have you been able to play out sets or points ?
what went wrong during the clay season ?
your father was talking about how there might be some changes within your immediate team with coaching or physio , i do n't know , but has there been any more talk or movement on that front since the french ?
rory is here . is he jet lagged ? did he manage to stay awake for the match ?
have you told him off for bending his club ?
it looked like today you were playing with maybe a different racquet . are you trying out different equipment or are my eyes bad ?
what are you looking for , like control or power ?
is that as a result of the last few months ?
have you been using the same strings for the last couple years ?
and what are they ?
i think you could play laura in the next round ?
obviously you just played her in france . how would you see that matchup on grass ?
pleased ?
your serve was working well today . was that a result of what you have been doing the last few days ?
the couple of break points you had in the first game against you , that must have been a confidence booster for you .
the contrast of abilities in your opponents is going to be huge . do you think you 're ready to step up that far , or would it have been better to have had someone higher ranked today ?
but a former world no.1 is something else , though . for the confidence that you 'll get , how much extra expectations do you think will be on you next week if you win the tournament ?
is there anything you learned in paris you can use on a different surface against her ?
with your win against williams , do you go into these games against top 10 players with a different mentality ?
is there a little bit more belief ?
do you get up for matches against top players more than you do for lowerranked opponent ?
if there 's one area of your game that you could wave a wand and improve , what would that be ?
how is it going with your new coach in the last week ?
what will you do tonight ? have a big night out planned in eastbourne ?
what 's cara been doing ?
baltacha won today . she looks in good form . do you see her challenging your british no.1 spot in the future ?
was it the same problem you had in nottingham ?
did it happen during the match ?
very disappointing
after you did so well here last year .
you have got a lot of ranking points to defend during this particular period . does that add any pressure ? obviously this injury is n't ideal for that .
will you head straight into london today ?
more time to walk the dog ?
are you someone who likes to watch tennis while you 're injured on tv ?
difficult finish of the match , was n't it ?
what did you do during the break ?
but overall for your first match on grass , what are your thoughts ?
tough one .
against someone who really knows how to play on grass . won here , wimbledon final , big challenge .
how would you assess that ? lots of breaks of serve .
she 's unorthodox , as well , is n't she ?
what does this do in terms of how you will play for next week ? what will you do from here ?
was the court a bit slippery at first ?
when the draw happens on friday , is that something you 'll be following closely online as it happens ? how interested are you in that ?
do you have any preference to if you 're offered serena on centre or the world no.2000 on court 17 ? do you have any preference to that ? would you like a big tv match ?
what can you take out of today 's game ahead of next week ?
ultimately was it just a frustrating experience ?
what 's it like playing locally ?
a change of nationality , as well . what 's it like to have a different home crowd ?
and the spectators ?
she does n't like playing you .
why do you think you match up so well against her ?
what do you think you did well today ?
were you concerned when you served for the first set , she broke you , she then had a set point . were you concerned at all ?
i think this was your sixth grass match already .
so in terms of making the transition from clay to the grass , how has it been so far ? obviously the win is great . how are you feel out there , and do you get the sense that your game is translating well ?
can you look back on obviously 2013 has been pretty incredible . so when you look back on it , is there a single match that you can look back and say whether you won or lost that was the one that gave you the confidence to be able to pull off these top 10 , top 5 wins ?
you came through qualifying , got hosed a little bit getting the top seed even though you were the top seed there . are you looking at the draws now and saying , like , i 'm excited to take on this challenge as opposed to like oh , my goodness , i 've kind of got screwed by the draw a little bit ?
how is twitter going ?
who talked you into it ?
madison is peeved that you got on twitter before she did .
how did it feel ?
obviously you won at nottingham but does this feel different because it 's a different tournament ? i mean ...
and the feeling of elation , winning , is it different because it 's a tour level ?
first one you 'd won since ...
your motivation looked very high .
your movement looked good , as well .
you have n't lost a set since the first week in nottingham . do you feel on a roll ? do you feel like you have momentum behind you ?
today when you came out to serve for the match and then when you were broken , how did that feel ?
you said before do you think it 's possible to come back to british no.1 ? do you feel that 's more likely after ...
if you had n't come back , what do you think you 'd be doing this week and next week ?
how many girls are there ?
good sponsorship ?
great start , obviously . what happened after that ?
you did n't seem to really get into that much of a rhythm today .
what is the game plan now as you kind of move on to wimbledon ? do you get to go and play some practice matches , or is it just kind of general hitting practice and movements ?
this is probably one of your least successful tournaments in your career ?
is it because of adjusting to the grass ?
do you prefer to be able to build points , or do you prefer quicker points ?
do you remember the first time that you played on grass ?
what was your first reaction , like literally , first rally with the ball bouncing ?
were you as surprised as us with the score ?
did you get to speak to her afterwards ? was there an injury we were n't aware of ?
it seemed like in the second set that you sort of knew she was going to miss if you got enough balls back in the court , no ?
did you feel bad for her at all ? i know you 're supposed to have killer instinct in tennis , but like in the last game when she missed an easy overhead did you start feeling like , oh ?
how are you feeling ? the last two weeks could n't have gone much better for you heading into the open .
australia is a land of punters and people that like to bet on sport . would you ask anyone to put money on you for the australian open ?
had a chance to look at your draw ?
you 've had some good winning streaks before . is there any special feeling when you start going that you feel like , i 'm just not going to lose the next couple weeks ?
is there any improvement left you can make to your game ?
anywhere in particular you think you can make the next step ?
where is your belief at going into melbourne ? do you believe you can win that grand slam ?
so two titles in a row . do you have time to celebrate even for five minutes , or just got to think , oh , grand slam ?
was there anything underlying , an injury that you were trying to shield ?
we could almost feel your frustrations growing ?
you said it has n't happened in a final before . has it happened any other time before at the wta level ?
therefore no explanation ?
after the first game in the second set , what , you felt like you started choking even though you had many games left ? you were thinking maybe 60 , 60 ?
is that partly due to the way she plays , that she gives you nothing ?
going into next week , do you just try to wipe that out and think about ...
even in the first set did n't you think , okay , i 'll just try to play long points with her ? your were missing your big shots . you were missing your forehand a lot .
are you able to give us an idea on just how well she 's playing . obviously this week you beat third , fourth , and fifth seeds , and she just seems to be another level .
almost like the win by a thousand cuts , all those match points ? how did you feel out there ?
you were quite aggressive on occasions out there , a bit of volleying . must be pretty happy with your game .
can you talk about the first game where you tried to serve it out , the first three match points ? you were maybe getting a bit aggressive and seemed like you were getting frustrated because you were n't hitting the ball as much , no ?
you had a hard time with her on hard courts last year in the matches . why did you turn it around today ?
are you the kind of person that enjoys a lot of matches , a lot backtoback matches ? i guess to go through and win the australian open you 're looking at 16 matches in a row .
obviously that 's a lot of matches and obviously something you contemplate . is that something that suits well for you ? some players here in particular , you get a feeling that they play a few games and take it easy , lose , or drop out to save yourselves . but that 's not the case for you ?
do you see yourself as maybe a little bit below serena ? i suppose with the win in auckland , here , that maybe in some people 's reckoning you 're going to that second tier , maybe the second level of favorites below serena ?
so you 've never won backtoback tournaments before ?
li na says she 's trying some new things to strengthen her game . did you sense any change at all compared to the last couple matches you played her ?
she says she is trying to be more aggressive and come to the net a little more . do you see that ?
also talk about the shot between the legs .
is that typical for a woman player to do that ?
how is the body holding up ? this is two weeks of constant matches . are you feeling fatigued physically ?
you 've improved so many things in your game first serve , forehand over the last few years . do you think it 's possible to add speed to your second serve , and is that something you work on ?
would you change your game much from the way you played today if you were playing serena or maria or victoria ?
the basic principles of how aggressive you are though , were you happy with that game today ? do you think it would match up well against the top 3 ?
are you okay with the crowd yelling your name , go aggie ? australians like to shorten names .
people have called you angie ?
where ?
your match was televised in poland for the first time this season . how important to you is it is that your fans can watch back home ?
the tournament in poland , the report says that you could n't play because you already play auckland last week . what 's the situation ?
words on either angelique kerber or dominika ? you will face one of them in the final . just a couple words about each player , what you like about their game .
do you think you should be allowed to play in poland ? i know what the rule is , but given that the tournament came in late , did you think they would make an exception for you ?
so you asked and they said no ?
you asked the tour ?
internationals in six months ?
they said no ?
who said no ? do you know ?
when did you hear that there was going to officially be a tournament there ?
so after you made your schedule ?
did you work harder on offseason serve and volley and coming to the net more ? because today when i was watching you attack more and you were coming more to the net . so her game allows you to do that ?
seem to be very comfortable .
you got back in the match , and then the third set she got on top of you pretty fast . seemed hard to get back in it then .
huge tournament next week , of course . how do you get over the disappointment ? just put it out of your mind quickly ?
take a couple days off just to rest and recover ?
you 've beaten a lot of players that are higher ranked than dominika , but you have n't beaten her yet . why does she give you trouble ?
is she hard to play because she goes for her shots so often ?
so going into next week , in order for you to reach your goals in australia , what are the things you need to do ?
if you were a tennis reporter for tomorrow night 's final , who do you think could win ?
there is a new tournament in poland on clay . are you playing that or another small event ?
do you feel like there is any added pressure this year ? you came into 2012 off your big run at the us open , and now this year you have such a good year behind you . do you feel like you 've got something to prove now ?
when you finally get away from tennis , do you play golf ? listen to music ? shop ? what helps you relax and get your mind off tennis ?
do you think maybe the pressure is off a lot of the other players because serena has been playing so well that so many people expect her to win the tournament ?
she 's a great defensive player , but you played better offense , huh ?
career record against agnieszka is i think 3nil in her favor . it 's been a long time since you played , i think five years . what are you expecting tomorrow ?
yes .
you talked about this before , the balance between being very offensive and defensive and getting the right balance so you 're winning matches consistently .
you 're an experienced player . must be exciting to make a final . how do you deal with the nerves the night before ? try to get a good night 's sleep ?
feel like patting yourself on the back ? it 's quite an achievement to get to a final .
so you 're getting closer and closer to the top 10 .
so radwanska could be complicated because she likes pace and power . talk a little bit about that , how to deal with that .
did you see all the schedule changes with the wta calendar ? did you see tokyo is going to china ?
what 's your thought on all the tournaments going to china after the us open ?
as a european , how do you deal with that knowing you have to go from new york and go to asia for six weeks , huh ?
deal with it ?
what a difference a day makes .
this is the seventh win so far for you this season . almost won your own grand slam .
perfect start for you leading into melbourne ?
do you feel you had to really fight for today ? there were some critical moments , particularly at the end of the first set and the end of the second set where it could have gone either way .
how did you identify that you needed to play more aggressive ? was that just in homework studying her or just in general in your game ? is that the key to making the next step ?
how do you prepare a strategy for a match ? do you and your coach work out a plan , or do you just go on court ?
looking back on your wimbledon final appearance , has that changed your outlook or your game or you as a person ?
you had such a great year last year . what do you want to achieve this year ?
what will you do differently or try to add to take that next step ?
if you had to choose between being no.1 and winning a grand slam , can you tell us which one you would choose and explain why ?
men 's draw had another two withdrawals with injury today . it must be a real juggling act working out how many tournaments to play before a grand slam in australia , especially coming out of the european winter . it 's also so early in the year . you 've played two tournaments now , so you 're one of the believers that you should get as much match practice as possible ?
what would it mean for tennis in poland if you could succeed in your goal of winning a grand slam ?
do you have a preference as to who you would play in a semifinal here ? would you like one of them to win tonight over the other ?
your injuries that you had last season , did you recover from those during the break , and how do you feel generally physically ?
you had a difficult match . your serve in the first set , you were having some problems with ?
not the serve ?
you played well on a lot of the big points . did you find with her groundstrokes she also hits her forehand very hard ?
she 's only 17 , which for the tour now i 'm not going to talk about your age . i see the look . not too many 17 year olds can play at that level . what do you think her future is ?
you defended so well today . is that the most pleasing thing that you get out of today 's win ?
you had some strapping on your knee today .
you 're okay ?
but there was tape on your knee .
carlos seemed very happy when you were moving forward all the time and attacking . is that what he was trying to get you to do ?
obviously short back up now and then very tough test tomorrow .
was yesterday 's match harder because of the heat , or was today harder because of the opponent for you ?
you had very good success against radwanska last year on hardcourts . why do you think that is ?
you obviously had success here the last couple of years . is this a really important event for you to start off your season ?
why do you think you have success at this tournament ? you 're at least in the semifinal for the last three years here .
heat or form ? was that a combination of hit or how you 're playing ?
the result , was it a result of it being so hot or partially on your form ?
are you a fan of the wta policy to allow breaks at the end of a second set ?
seemed like during the match you were playing really well at times , not so well at times , getting frustrated , you were happy . sort of up and down , no ?
svetlana , because of her injury last year , her ranking has really dropped , and therefore , there is a prospect that anyone of you could meet her first round next week in melbourne . how will the leading players be thinking about that possibility with her in the draw ?
she 's playing much better than 72 or whatever her ranking is .
honestly , confidencewise going into melbourne where you ?
coming into this season were you happy with the offseason ? are you happy with your style right now , or do you feel a little bit in between being the old caroline , defensive wall , and the newer caroline , being more aggressive on certain points ?
have you played a match where you felt hotter than today ?
i was out there , and it was hot as hell out there and i was sitting in the shade . do you think there comes a time where there should be like the cricketers stop playing when it 's raining do you think there should be a temperature cut off ?
do you think play should have been postponed today until later tonight even ?
you 've been on tour now a number years . are you making the decisions during the matches as to strategy and how you want to play , or when your dad comes on court is he saying , this is what i want you to do and then you try to follow ?
you talked about needing to get your consistency back . how does someone like you lose something like that , because it was such a strength of your ?
do you feel it 's inevitable to be back in the top 5 this year ?
how hot is it out there on court did you find it today ?
have you played in hot conditions like that before ? was that as hot as you 've played in ?
where was that ?
is it getting to the state they might have to stop it and give the players a bit of a reprieve ?
do you find yourself adjusting your game at all ? you usually like to work the points . when it 's this hot do you think , maybe i should end this point faster ?
does it feel more like the heat is your opponent than the player ?
what did you do on court between the breaks to try to keep yourself cool ?
ice bath ?
do the players get much input in terms of commenting on these kind of situations and sort of saying , well , this is too much ? are your concerns taken fairly seriously ? how does that work ?
would you be in favor of a thirdset tiebreaker in singles matches on days like this outside of the grand slams ?
like they do in doubles , if it gets too hot , having a tiebreaker instead of the third set ?
so you would be in favor of delaying the matches until the nighttime or the next day ?
what if it keeps going on during the week though ? then what do you do ?
what about you and your fitness ? do you go out there and feel good about your body and training ? do you feel like you have a little bit of an advantage ?
in the locker rooms is there any talk of players withdrawing because of the heat ?
when you plan your schedule in the offseason , do you think , well , if i win auckland and sydney i 'll go into melbourne with a lot of the matches played , or were you so confident with your fitness that you thought it does n't matter , you 'll be fine there anyway ?
how do you feel you played today in these conditions ?
how did you feel like you used the conditions in the second set ? what did you do to use the conditions to your advantage ?
what was the most important thing you worked on during the offseason ?
a lot of tough matches in australia . is that one the toughest because of the heat ?
today . how does that compare with some of the very hot matches you 've played in australia in the past ?
from where you are though it must be very satisfying winning , because you battled the last few months ?
when you had your knee injury , did you have surgery ?
so you only had five weeks because that 's when your knee was okay to start practicing ?
when is the last time you felt this mentally fresh ? before you started playing pro tour ?
a lot players when they go out for months they will say , oh , i did n't know how much i miss tennis . sometimes it sounds like a cliche , but did that happen to you at some point in the last six months , that you thought there were times you were bored with the game and you hated it and now you feel like you really want to be back on court ?
yes .
so then how did you get back onto the practice court if you did n't miss it ? did you just say , this is my job ?
yeah .
so it was more the grind of the tour that was the thing you had enough of ?
do you feel like this match was a turning point again to beat a top10 player again ? do you feel like you could get some momentum from here going into melbourne ?
what 's your goal ? you were just talking about you have to have goals in life .
when you 're at home in moscow and myskina has been retired , dementieva is retired , obviously you know dinara well and it looks like she might not come back , were you thinking at some time , oh , i kind of like their lives ; maybe i 'll just stay home ; i do n't have to keep playing anymore ?
you 're a twotime grand slam champion . did you want a wildcard into here ? you had to play qualifying . did you ask for a wildcard ?
what was happening in the second set today ? obviously you won the first set . in the second were you struggling with the heat before the break ?
so was it getting cool again in the break that helped you ? was it a mental break ?
how was it out there for you today ?
your opponent was treated for heat stress at one stage , yes ?
the girl you played against , galina , was treated for heat stress .
but you saw the medical timeout ?
what do you do when something like that happens with your opponent ? how did you stay inside your own head ?
your next opponent is svetlana .
obviously her ranking is not where it was because of injury . she 's going to be a very dangerous opponent in the draw in the next few weeks , do you think ?
how did you handle the heat yourself ? what could you do to try and lessen its impact ?
how much water do you drink before the a game when you know it 's going to be hot ?
how many liters ?
and it 's water , not sports mixed drink or anything like that ?
was there any stage where you felt like it was too hot to be out there , or did you feel it was okay to play ?
have you played in these conditions before somewhere ?
do you feel it 's a good preparation for melbourne next week in case you get something similar ?
have you seen a trainer after the match or had any treatment to cope with it ?
do you normally have an ice bath after each match ?
how are you feeling physically after your surgery ? how much did that sort of possible lack of match toughness and physical ...
so not the end world in your eyes ?
how rushed is this preparation ? would you even be playing now if you were n't trying to be ready for the australian open next week ?
what will you be doing now in the leadup to melbourne over the next week ?
what do you feel was better tonight that last week ?
does that give you some hope that you can make a similar jump forward with another week 's practice to be at a reasonable level ?
not winning the big points last week or tonight , is that more lack of preparation or still something to do with playing at home ?
how do you think you are handling pressures of playing on home soil ?
i 've asked this of a few players in the last week : given that you guys have played all your life , when you take off a small period of time , come back and play matches , does it feel like you have n't been playing for a long time ? do you really get that rusty ?
what would be an ideal australian open for you ?
has there ever been a time in australia where you felt like you did at the us open , where you could just go out and play and your game is there and your confidence ? even against victoria you pushed her and seemed like almost no nerves whatsoever , executing most of the time .
sydney is one thing ; melbourne is obviously another step up in terms of dealing with the pressure and all that stuff . are you ready for what 's there next week ?
in a bigger grand slam sized draw , does that give you a little bit of comfortable that you can be protected a little more ?
did you feel playing this match tonight has sort of accelerated your progress by having three sets out there , hard fought , and having to go through the motions of all those things ?
serena lost a handful of games and only one match since last summer . i think she 's 35 or 36. is it fair to call her a significant favorite in australia next week ?
how is the ankle and how is the head ?
how much did the falls affect you afterwards ? did it affect your play ?
did the falls affect you .
the second fall was right after the fireworks . do you think having that break was a factor in you falling over again ?
although you 'll be disappointed now , you must be very satisfied with the twoweek campaign that you 've had .
are you enjoying your tennis more at the moment than you were 12 months ago ?
do you think without falling down you would have won today ?
did you feel like you were in a very good position at that time ?
did n't you feel like coming into the match , after beating maria the way you did , if you played your best you could win ?
could you feel the bulk of the stadium was behind you tonight ?
have you ever had a crowd that big in your favor before ? have you felt that ?
does this loss hurt more than the 2011 final ?
it seemed like after the loss in 2011 you were a little more happy . after this one , a few more tears .
besides falling down those two times , were you happy or satisfied with the level of your play throughout the match ?
were you happy with your play today in the match ?
after the match you made reference to your age . how long do you think you can keep going on for ?
why do you think you fell down ?
there was a controversy in the semifinal between sloane stephens regarding medical timeouts .
was that going through your head a little bit ?
have you had the chance to talk to carlos ? if so , what has he said to you after the match ?
the last time you lost the australian open final you went on and won the french open not long after . do you think you have the motivation to take this further and keep going from here ?
you must be very happy with a long , tough match , and you had to deal with quite a bit with the injury timeouts and fireworks . how do you feel now ?
li na said she felt you perhaps played better on the bigger games in the end . is that how you feel the match was decided ?
how much more difficult is it coming into a slam defending the title ?
was it difficult for you to get your head right going into the final , bearing in mind the talk of the last couple of days ?
is this the most pressure you ever felt going into a match ? your no.1 ranking was up for grabs if you lost .
were you surprised with the way that li na bounced back after the two heavy falls ?
a 10minute break for fireworks does n't happen at every grand slam tournament .
does that break up the momentum of the game to a certain degree ?
what did you do during the break ? did you go into the locker room ?
what was the music what you were listening to before you entered ? red foo ?
going into the 53 game in the third set where you served for it against sloane , also thinking back to the us open against serena , you had a 53 lead , did you really have to focus on making sure you wanted to close it out returning instead of having to go and serve for it ?
why do you accept balls from the righthand side only ?
a particular side ?
is it something superstitious ?
were you worried about the reception you might get when you went on court at the beginning ?
in the circumstances , do you actually derive greater satisfaction from retaining the title than you did actually winning it the first time last year ?
was it emotional just because of what happened with sloane or are there other reasons why it 's so emotional ?
do you think the way things happened tonight with the break and with li na 's tumbling a couple of times , the way you handled that situation , that you 've won back some fans that might have been skeptical after the last match ?
you said the semifinal was a learning experience . what did you learn ?
have you got some sort of guarantee from your support crew in the box that they 're going to follow you around to a few more slams ?
last year you won and novak won the men 's . in the end of the year , you both claimed the top spot . are you going to text him something about that ?
yes .
you said at the very start you learned to become a better player and person . you said before about being honest . is that what you 're talking about when you say being a better person ?
what are your first thoughts on your first slam semifinal ?
what did you think when she took the long medical break at the end ?
we had the impression it was for her to calm herself down a bit instead of a physical problem . was that the impression you got ?
she said she felt overwhelmed , she could n't breathe , she had chest pains . she was describing basically a panic attack . if it was nerves or not a tweaked ankle or knee , does that bother you ?
you do n't want to use that as kind of a reason for why the match did n't go your way ?
you 've had quite a few people take medical timeouts this tournament . do you think there are players abusing the system ?
would you feel comfortable leaving the court for nine minutes having just blown five match points ?
would it play on your conscience , leaving the court for nine minutes after blowing five match points ?
did you lose momentum in those 10 minutes while you were sitting there waiting for her ?
has she said anything to you ? on tv she was pretty outspoken about the fact that it was n't your conventional physical break . has she apologized or in any way conveyed anything to you about that ?
it was a breathing problem . do you feel it may have been some gamesmanship on her part at that point in time ?
did you have nerves starting out today ? how did you feel going out on the court on such a big occasion ?
you 're to no.17 after this tournament . pretty big jump . does this change your expectations or schedule for the rest of this year ?
what was last night like ? did you sleep okay ?
did beating serena give you more confidence today going in ?
did li play too well today or you were n't aggressive enough ?
do you see the potential of her winning in the final ?
people may look to your previous matches and think you did n't have enough of a test early on . do you buy into that at all ?
did you feel a little bit flat today , not feeling up for it ?
you 've played her a lot . was that as well as you 've seen her play ?
you two are very familiar to each other . for this game , do you think her tactics were familiar to you , her serve , her forehand ? is it still familiar to you ?
how disappointing is this for you ? obviously you wanted to win the whole thing .
was the heat a factor today ?
she came out and took a quick lead in the first set . did you think about making adjustments ?
with serena out , do you sort of see this as a missed opportunity ?
the field was a bit more open . did you see that ?
where do you see li na 's level of play right now ? a solid top five or potential no.1 ?
did you expect yourself to play better today ?
what is your next tournament ?
is that as perfect of a match as you could have hoped for ?
does it feel different to be in the australian open final this time compared to the first time ?
as far as your playing goes , are you better prepared ?
for the final than you were with your game plan and everything .
do you think your buildup and having so many matches under your belt held you in good stead against maria today and also for the final ?
how important is the work you have done with carlos rodriguez to get to the final ?
do you think having carlos on your side this time will make it easier than 2011 in the final ?
do you think it will be easier this time in the final now that you have carlos with you to give you advice and help you prepare ?
you had lots of tight games and you managed to stay focused and keep emotions in check . is that something you worked on ?
what goes through your mind ?
and that 's work ?
yesterday jowilfried tsonga was asked why topseeded women 's players lose more than the topseeded men . he said because of hormones , because women are more emotionally unstable .
do you have any thoughts on that ?
you do n't think hormones have anything to do with it ; you think it 's more about tennis ?
do you have a theory on why there 's sort of upsets at the top level in the women 's game as opposed to the men ?
you have a big following in china . do you feel the expectations of people back home to win these grand slam matches ? do you still feel pressure ?
is that also an internal change for you that you 're putting less pressure on yourself and you just have the confidence to go out and play well because you have before ?
jiang shan 's english name is dennis . do you have an english name ?
do you have any thoughts about your next opponent who you fight face , victoria or sloane ?
what did you learn after losing the final here ?
sloane stephens has been eating dinner at the same restaurant every night . have you been going to the same place ?
has carlos shown you a couple new places in melbourne you have n't been to before ?
could you perhaps talk us through the end of the match and what prompted your departure and when you came back .
can you understand that people perceive that as being gamesmanship at that particular point in the game ?
would you agree the timing was unfortunate ?
what treatment did you have ?
you said after the match you were overwhelmed , rather than mentioning your back . is there a reason why you did n't mention it ?
yes .
you were also asked on espn and you made no mention of your back as well .
in your previous answers , you attributed the not being able to breathe being pretty much directly to not converting the five match points in the game before . you said you had to take some time to get your mind together when you were going offcourt . this seems like a very different answer that you 're giving now .
it was reported there was also a knee that was one of the problems when you went off court .
given how bad it was , were you surprised at the speed of your recovery ?
do you have any sympathy for sloane , who had to sit there for 10 minutes waiting to serve to stay in the match ?
you were saying , though , that you were choking . that 's what you said when you came off court . did the choking have anything to do with your shortness of breath ?
when you were going up to approach the ball on match points , oh , my good , my rib hurts ; you could n't breathe ? you could n't swing ?
so it did n't feel like a panic attack , that the pain was causing you to panic maybe ?
so in hindsight , do you think you owe an apology to sloane just for the timing of it , the medical timeout ?
have you ever had that sensation before when you 've played ?
how do you think you would have felt if it was the other way around ?
it was very long one at an important time of the match .
do you think some players are abusing this rule , not yourself , but other players use it as a stalling tactic sometimes that you 've experienced ?
when did you start to feel the rib ?
at what point in the match did it get bad ?
is it going to be a factor in the final ?
you 'll play li na in the final who has improved a lot technically and mentally . do you approach that match as you did before against her ?
is last year 's final experience going to be an advantage for you to face her ?
you seem a little bit stressed . you have two days to recompose . talk about what you 're going to do to get ready for the final .
do you feel like people give you too hard a time over things like this ?
can you talk about how happy you are to retain the no.1 ranking given that sharapova lost and how hungry you are to defend your title ?
your emotions , where are you at at the moment ?
how is the physical injury ? how is the back ?
you were serving at about 130 kilometer an hour after the back problem . what exactly happened ? was it tight ?
that point where it happened , can you talk us through that moment .
when you went off court , what sort of treatment did you have ? did you take any antiinflammatories ?
did it feel better when you came back on ? were you freer ?
the microphones on court picked up you saying this has been the worst two weeks . what did you mean by that ?
is it the worst couple weeks you 've had at a grand slam ?
did you ever think about retiring at any point ?
did you get the sense sloane was freaking out a bit towards the end of the second set , just the drama of it all , the injury and everything else , and it was quite hard for her to push through ?
could you tell us what you think of her as a player and how far she 's going to push on from here .
what did you think of the quality of the match before you tweaked the back ?
obviously your serve speed went way down when you had the injury . you started to work your way back in the match in the third set . how much of that were you fighting yourself and how much were you fighting injury in that third set ?
yesterday in the game you also hurt a little bit . i want to know before the game today , what did you think about it ? have you ever worried about your injuries ?
just think about it , think about the injury and worry about that .
did you get some frustrations out with that racquet smash ?
you were in mauritius for some preparation . that is my home town . how did it go there ?
you mentioned being relieved , this being a difficult two weeks . it 's been a long time since you 've lost a match . does the pressure build up ? does it become more and more difficult to keep it going ?
do you think she 's quiet in the game ?
in last several games you said , you should grunt . she 's a little bit quiet . also as a mentor for her she thinks of you as a mentor in the future , will you give her some advice ?
you were such a favorite for the tournament . how do you see it now on the women 's side ? who do you see progressing to saturday ?
is that no.1 ranking of big importance to you ? if it 's going elsewhere now , does that add to the disappointment or not really ?
you were n't able to express your emotions in the court earlier . maybe you can express them now after a few minutes after you won .
not many people gave you a chance to do what you just did . what chance did you give yourself before you stepped out on the court ?
did her back problems throw you off ? did that affect your game ?
did you feel some nerves at that point , and also when you had set point ?
when you had set points in the second set , the first ones .
you had a set point and three errors in that service game .
did you feel in the third set when she broke at 43 , did you feel that she got nervous ?
what about when serena started beating up on her racquet and whacked it a couple times into the ground ? were you thinking , i 'm the one who just made serena williams do that ?
when you see someone unravelling like that , does that give you a mental edge ?
what did you say to her at the net at the end of the match ?
how did you keep your focus when she was off court ? had you experienced that sort of thing ? how did you keep your focus ?
did it seem a long period of time ?
this time last year you were calling her a tennis god and you had n't established a relationship with her . today you beat the tennis god . talk about your mental improvement and ability .
you went for the smartphone pretty fast after the match . i know you were looking for a text from your mom . what was the first thing you saw ?
do you remember the first time you watched the game of serena on tv ? when you were a little girl , did you ever try to learn from her on tv and imitate her ?
how much better did you play today than you did in your fourthround match ?
i know you 're a big tweeter . how many followers did you have before this match ?
so you should just beat serena more and more and keep doubling and doubling .
how many messages did you end up with on your phone ?
how on earth are you going to respond or reply ?
when you came in , you said you were just going to go for it . at this stage now , to be where you are , is that beyond the wildest expectations you had at the start of the australian summer ?
when is the moment walking through the corridors when you sort of pinch yourself and say , i 've done this ?
talk about azarenka .
one of those messages was n't from the white house , was it ?
i think you 're going to get one .
i do n't know it .
back to the very start of the match in warmup , bernard tomic said after playing federer that before the match he kind of felt good , and then they started reading out the honor roll . did you go through anything like that , having it play with your mind ?
after the us open , if someone would have told you australian open semifinals in four months , what would you have said ?
you were talking in hobart about wanting to get your firstever title . what would it be like to get your firstever title at a grand slam ?
how much did you feel like brisbane helped you facing serena , sort of the experience there from going into today on this stage ?
you seem to be very calm and quiet on the court . is this your true personality or do you have some mental work as well ?
it 's a natural ability .
when she got hurt in the second set , how difficult was it to stay calm ? did you think about changing tactics ? what was going through your head ?
since you are a different person off the court , can you share what you do in your leisure time ?
when did you start working with your current coach ?
what do you think was the key to the first set ? was there a specific point ?
you 're doing a lot of sliding around out there , a lot of running . how does the knee feel ?
but it felt fine after ?
what part of the match was it ?
do you feel far from your best level , or ...
overall are you happy with the performance in the tournament so far ?
for the whole australian open , are you happy progressing to the quarterfinal stage ?
that first set was 77 minutes . you said you were prepared for what svetlana might throw at you . it was a long set . just talk us through that first set . it was close and good tennis .
in that 10deuce game , was that the turning point ? is that what you were talking about , the very long game ?
yes .
you 've played a lot of morning matches here . are you a morning person ?
does this bother you ?
as the no.1 player on the women 's side , do you think you should be having at least one night spot or a late afternoon start ?
first sets sometimes are n't that important . today it feels like that was an important first set to win .
in the context of coming to a semifinal in a grand slam , that 's the sort of match you really wanted to outfox your opponent and know that your good tennis can come right when you want it ?
serena is still playing out there . should she be your next opponent , what can you do differently against her in a match that would turn the tide against her ?
the no.1 ranking is on the line over the next week . is that something that you 're focusing on ?
has it mattered in the past how well you were going into the match against serena or not ?
practicing well , not practicing well , all of that is out once you get on court ?
the last few days of the tournament , do you actually get a little bit excited or nervous , a semifinal , final ? do you feel an adrenaline rise , or do you try to suppress that and try to treat every match the same ?
is it really impossible to read serena 's serve ? you 're a great returner , you 're fine on second serves , but you played her enough times , do you find yourself guessing on the first serves or not ?
i would think against her maybe the most important thing is returning , because you stay with her off the ground all the time , but against any player it 's her serve that sort of bails her out even if she 's not playing well .
any comments on sloane in case she beats serena , what you know of her game .
dropped nine games all the way to the semis . are you pleased about this ? how did you feel about today ?
did you get to see the game earlier today or is that something you 'll watch tonight ?
you really have n't lost focus at all for more than , what , a game or a few points the whole tournament ?
i guess the next match , you know her very well . she 's been playing great ; she 's a veteran player . last time you played her , was it rome ?
does it worry you at all you have n't had a big test yet going into the semis ?
since you coach and agent are familiar with li na , do you think it 's your advantage this time because they would give you some very useful advice ?
have you ever tried to ask max the question about , who would you root for ?
what 's the answer ?
he roots for more deals , huh ?
especially as the ceo of sugarpova .
li na is being coached by carlos rodriguez who you clearly know from justine . have you noticed any difference in her game , or did you in beijing , or was it pretty much the same ?
have you seen sloane stephens play ?
madison keys you 've seen a little bit more .
a couple impressions on her .
yes .
according to forbes , li na is the second most paid female athlete in the world .
do you feel like it 's an interesting thing to know ?
you are the most paid .
i do n't know .
the county of miami dade has approved the site to be revamped there . how much have you felt in the last few years that the tournament needs a facelift , that it 's lagging behind the other events ?
have you ever gave out some sugarpova to the girls or your rivals or li na ?
maybe li na can bring a bag to china and do a promotion for you .
what was the difference from today to when you last played her a week or so ago ?
she is someone who has played well against you . what is it about her game that makes it a tough matchup for you ?
in the first set it seemed very tough to hold serve . was that due to the conditions on the court ?
before this match you had some of the best serving stats of anybody in the tournament . how much have you worked on making that part of your game better ?
is it something you 've been focusing on , your serve ?
you played 13 matches to start the year , winning them all . did you still feel fresh today or do you think maybe there was too much tennis before the australian open ?
you have battled several times . since carlos joined her team , do you feel she has different tactics ?
people have been talking about li 's improvement on her emotional management . she seems more composed on court . can you feel that change in her game from the other side of the court ?
do you feel like li na 's forehand is much more consistent compared to previous matches ?
what is your schedule from here on out ? you take a little bit of time off and then regroup ?
today ?
when she served the ball into the crowd way over your head , what did you think ?
can you give a prediction about the semis ?
between li na and her next opponent in the semis .
should be the winner between sharapova and makarova .
what are your feelings or impressions from today 's game ? you took more games off her than almost everyone else combined .
what is it she 's doing so well that 's making her so dominant ?
what was your approach to try to stop that ?
what did you do better than when you played her a week ago ?
i think at the start of the second set you lost about eight points in a row and then the next five games you turned it around . what did you do ?
do you feel calmer on the court these days , and why do you think you 're feeling more calm ?
this is your third semifinal here in four years . why do you think this is your best slam ? this seems to be your best slam . do you agree ?
why do you think it is ?
do you think it being the beginning of the year also helps for you ?
i 'm saying you work hard in the offseason .
knowing that you won a grand slam , do you feel like this could be your best chance again to maybe win and do better than you 've done in the past and go all the way ?
you said on court that carlos was training pretty harshly in the offseason .
what sort of stuff was he doing to you ? how difficult was the preseason ?
did you think about quitting at some point , stopping your work with him ?
maria sharapova has only lost five games in her first four matches . have you been able to see any of her ? what do you think about playing somebody who is playing that well ?
if you play her , who do you think max will root for ?
what happened with that serve ?
do you think you 're enjoying tennis again ? it seemed after you won the french open there was a lot of pressure ; last year you had a tough match here . are you feeling happier ?
on court you mentioned since your husband stopped coaching you you have a better family life . could you tell us a bit more about that .
you played maria three times last year . i think she won all three matches . where do you think you 've improved and where do you think she 's improved in the last few months if you do play her on thursday ?
how are you feeling after that game ? it seemed pretty taxing .
what do you view as the difference in the match ?
were you upset by the ruling umpire with that serve ? obviously you argued with him .
did that affect you , have a big impact , or just ...
what about her lengthy breaks when she had a medical timeout ? how did that affect you ?
are you generally encouraged just by the tournament after the start of the year ?
you mentioned a moment ago a few points here or there , how thin the margins are . do you think the average fan really understands how close the margins are in these matches ? it 's a point or line here or a call there ?
that was such a dominant performance . were you surprised how quickly it was over ?
you had 87 % first serves . have you ever had that good a serving day , do you think ?
the ball speed changes at night .
you dropped eight games . what do you take out of the first four matches ?
you have sloane next . anything surprise you the first time you played her ?
is the word 'mentor ' accurate to define that relationship with sloane , or is that overstated ?
do you feel a responsibility at all towards her ?
did you actually tell her that she 's not loud enough and she needs to grunt more ? that 's what she said .
i do n't know if you 've been keeping up in the football .
the harbaughs are going to be facing off . siblings going against each other . can you talk about the ups and downs of siblings competing .
are the victories more muted over her than other players ?
who are the friends you have on the respective teams ?
in which year was the first time you began to notice sloane ? what was her impression on you at that time ? when did you begin to talk to each other ?
if you would have a second life , would you love to be a tennis ball ?
might you have a little bit of a passing interest in jeremy chardy 's match ?
he said you did , yeah .
what would your impression be of his match against murray ?
how does it feel ?
did you have your hands full kind of with your own psyche today out there ?
there was a lot of commentary on television about the grunting . did it get to you ?
did you feel yourself having to force yourself to go for more as the match went on in the third ?
so you were very effective at the net the first couple sets . did you think you ought to be doing that more or was she not letting you do that ?
serena , totally different story . how do you see that ?
assuming she does .
what did you learn in your matches with her recently ?
it seemed like in that match there were some things that annoyed you a little bit about playing serena . how do you get over that to play her the next time ?
there 's a lot of buzz now , you 're enjoying this potential top 10. does that kind of stuff make you happy , make you nervous ? how do you feel about hearing that stuff ?
what is the bet ?
what are the stakes ?
you played a lot of matches this month . how is your body holding up ? how are things feeling ?
is it better to have played her so recently than to not have ? is it to your advantage because you learned stuff ?
you have a contest on your twitter .
what gave you that idea ? was that for this match ?
where did you get that idea ?
a few extra tickets ?
do you think there 's more pressure on you to get the firstever quarterfinal being the favorite in this match , being the seeded player versus an unseeded player ? do you feel there 's more expectation on you than there might have been like against stosur at the french ?
this is your first run to a quarterfinal at a major . serena , presuming you played her , has won 15 titles . it must be difficult to go into a match like that .
what is your relationship with her like ?
so what happens with the jimmy choo picture ?
when you first got back from your injury , could you imagine you 'd be in a quarterfinal of a grand slam ?
but a satisfying win anyway ; a quarterfinal .
how did it feel to be in the third set of a big grand slam quarterfinal again ? i know your toes looked a little sore , but hitting the ball well , feeling good , competing ?
you talked about last year having time off . that was good for you for your mindset . why did you never take time off in your career before ?
the time violation that you got after the second set , did you realize how close you were getting to the time ?
obviously did n't upset you , though .
did you have to tell yourself to go for your shots down 43 ? there were the two break points there . did you have to say , i have the courage to do this or did it just come back naturally ?
i noticed your tattoo on your arm . when did you get that ?
it was pretty specific about pain .
after your knee though ?
was there any points after you had the injury last year that you thought you might call it a day and decide to end your tennis career , or did you always think you 're going to come back ?
the last time you played victoria was your knee so bad that you really could n't compete ? indian wells last year .
yes , you are . ( laughter . ) so the last two times , just talk about playing victoria then .
what do you think about caroline 's game today ?
you have a new clothing deal ; is that right ?
when did that happen ?
here ?
just talk about how that came about .
you mentioned earlier doing what you do best . what is it that you think that you do best on the tennis court ?
did you notice anything specific that azarenka was doing last year that was different in the years prior when you were beating her fairly consistently ?
obviously serena has been playing well for the last year . even for her , that was a good performance . did you feel there was anything you could do out there tonight ?
you felt like playing against her you had to do more ?
she made 87 % of her first serves .
have you ever played anyone who served as well as she did ?
how surprised would you be if serena did n't win the tournament ?
when you choose to receive , do you always do that or does is depend on the opponent and the situation ? why do you do it ? at the start of a match when you win the toss , you choose to receive .
you said after the third round that you had to improve everything . did you improve everything or she did n't put up as much of a fight as hampton ?
svetlana said in her interview she thinks you 're calmer and more stable playing now .
is that something you agree with ? if so , is it something you 've been working on ?
is there anything in particular you found works keeping it in control when you 're playing ?
how important is music in your prematch preparation ?
what were you listening to today ?
who is it by ?
where are they from ?
specifically for you ?
what else do you have on your ipod ?
what does it do for you before the match ? is it something that helps you to focus or psych you up ?
i think you said you do n't have a good singing voice , but your voice is in a redfoo song , right ?
he laid that into a song ?
is it out yet , the song ?
can you speak about your quarterfinal ?
in what way are you a different player since you won here last year ?
is your collarbone causing you too much trouble at the moment , maria ?
when you 're playing as well as you are , what do you do to keep it up ? does it ever get nervewracking that it might stop at some point ?
statistically you 've probably never had as good a start . can you remember when you 've had anything like this , dropping as few games as you have ?
the year you won here you beat a lot of good players , three former no.1 's .
dementieva in the fourth round . all respect to flipkens , but she 's not dementieva . do you know where your level is right now ?
do you know much about her story , what she 's done in the last year , after blood clots and everything ?
she had blood clots last april , ranked 260 ; she 's done pretty well .
do you think you 're playing well enough to win this or do you really have to wait till you play some of the fellow high seeds to find that out ?
you 've been playing very well , but particularly this tournament we can see lots of return winners . how do you feel about your return at the moment ?
so you are happy with your return ?
when you spend so little time on the match court in matches , do you then go onto the practice court or are you satisfied with just the match ? some people feel they have n't been extended and want to play more in the day .
how much more time do you spend on recovery than you did maybe four years ago or eight years ago ?
is there such a thing as getting like a special feeling during a grand slam that you know you 're going to play well or is it really matchtomatch , daytoday ?
2008 , what match did you know you might win ? was it justine when you beat her in the quarters ?
do you have any certain habits to give your game confidence before the game ? for example , like when you wake up today , what do you usually do ? like choose a certain color of dress or do something that makes you feel goodlooking or fresh ?
are you still practicing your yoga every day ?
if you were to make a new sugarpova flavor based on your first four matches , what would it be called ?
happypova ?
how do you feel like you played out there tonight ? how do you feel about your performance ?
do you feel like you 've hit a different level these last few weeks ? you have n't lost a match or a set . everything looked seamless out there .
how do you feel about your next opponent , meeting li na ?
with the performance you showed in all these matches , do you think maybe in small parts of your heart you 're unstoppable ?
do you feel like your run at wimbledon , when you made it to the final , that that gives you that confidence that you really can win those next three matches ?
i recall reading that you did some interesting training in december in poland in very cold weather . could you tell us about that .
were you training outside , too ?
you have been very successful in tokyo . i do n't know if you know it or not , but that tournament will be replaced by china . could you give us any comments on that .
speaking of the next round against li na , will you approach that match with the same strategy ? seems last time it went down very well . she 's also on a very good momentum at this time .
you and li na do n't have very strong serve . in your mind , who got a better one ?
you and li na do n't have very strong serve obviously . but in your mind , who has the better one ?
can you just tell us a little about your coach . you used to be coached by your father . what has your coach brought to you and your game ?
about the tokyo tournament moving to china , do you think it 's going to be easier for you guys to prepare for two important tournaments in a near city ?
on television today the commentator said you were playing the best tennis of your life .
what can you say about playing maria in the next round ?
are you friendly with her ?
what gives you confidence that you 'll be able to give her a good challenge ?
you 've had lots of success in australia . what do you put that down to ?
last year you came here you were playing very badly , right , in the fall ? i think you lost five or six first rounds before australia last year .
then you started playing well here . is it different coming this year ; you 're a little more confident starting the year ?
what is it like knowing you 're coming up against an opponent who has been just almost breezing past the people she 's played so far in the tournament ?
yeah . she 's winning her games so easily , seemingly easily . what is it like coming up against her ?
are you confident you can destruct her ?
can you take us through the tiebreaker . you were down . what was going through your head ?
so overall you 're happy with your performance today ?
how do you feel about playing ivanovic or radwanska ? who do you prefer to play ?
can you talk about what you 've done in your off time . yesterday kei nishikori went to make some sushi . have you done anything interesting in melbourne ?
was it your back that was troubling you ? how is that ?
it seemed like your serve was a bit affected . what affected that ?
did you go into the match feeling anything , or did it happen ...
your opponent , she seemed to obviously test you pretty well , as well .
do you think she can go further ? like is she in pretty good form ?
is there frustration about the injury and how that affected the result today ?
do you take some positives out of the tournament , seeing that it was an injury that had a large part in today 's result and up till then you were playing well ?
do you feel okay right now ? is there something you can take away from tonight 's match ?
do you feel like you 're getting up to that level ?
did you feel like she played better than you expected her to ? she did n't miss any balls out there all night .
when you say you 're surprised by the speed , was she hitting harder than you thought or softer ?
she 's not known for somebody who is a really big server . she had seven aces tonight . do you think her serve is an underrespected part of her game ?
i know you talked about wanting to develop upper body strength . how do you go about doing that ? hit the weight room ?
bench pressing or ...
how many pushups can you do now at a time ?
is it frustrating for you ? you get to the fourth round , and i suppose the highs of your career sort of four or five years ago , you are always defined by that . is it frustrating that people keep harkening back to the french open and runnerup here at the australian open ?
that keeps you going ?
do you think agnieszka can challenge serena , sharapova , azarenka for a grand slam title ? is she on the same level ?
on your strength thing , your serve , is that part of it ? you do n't quite have the velocity you had earlier in your career . is it all about upper body strength ?
i know you just crushed your opponent , but you got behind at the beginning of the second set , so maybe you can say something positive about your opponent .
can you share what you said at the net ?
where are you feeling your level is going into the second week ?
so your ankle is feeling better every day ?
you 're able to practice hard ?
what did you say to venus at the end of last night 's match ?
so far , especially in this tournament , you turned your ankle , hit yourself in the head with the racquet . what 's next ?
the 207 serve , two matches in a row , do you keep track of things like that ?
have you ever gone faster than that ?
is the game against kirilenko to go more than 207 ?
what is your record against her ?
you 've played her five times and you 've never lost .
where do you put your doubles titles with venus compared to your singles titles ?
you spoke already about having a new frame of mind this year , how you feel more calm than before . can you talk us through the evolution a bit . what changed for you ?
what did you say at the end of the match to her ?
did you see any of the lance armstrong program ?
what is your reaction to what you saw ?
do you worry about the sport of tennis ?
can you talk a little bit about jamie hampton ? she nearly beat victoria today . what did you see about her game when she was your practice partner in kharkiv ?
to bring it back to armstrong , did you know him or meet him ?
when was that ?
some kind of awards thing ?
was it an espy thing ?
did you listen to him and are you now more disappointed because you were possibly inspired by what he said ?
did you read his book , the first one ?
getting back to tennis , you watched the match last night . if you make the final this year , you 're going to most likely face maria sharapova . how do you think you 'll go about beating sharapova in the final ? she was very good last night .
on another note , the former tennis player gussie moran passed away this week . she was famous in the 1940s and '50s for becoming the first woman to wear short tennis skirts , scandalized wimbledon . she was ahead of her time . can you imagine a time ...
did it feel like fed cup match ?
do n't understand why ?
were you surprised to be on that court ?
do you feel like that at all ? you joke , but is that serious somewhat ?
it was gusty .
hardest one you played on or not ?
talk about the intensity level throughout .
you seemed like you lost your momentum when she took that medical timeout . is that fair to say ?
do you mind when the crowd was pretty much for her ?
you had a good look at the tour now . do you feel like you 're ready to make a big impact ?
how do you feel about your overall level in the tournament ?
did you go out and hit after this match ?
when the crowd is like that , do you focus more and do you concentrate more ?
when they cheer your unforced errors , you do n't feel like turning and saying , can you shut up ?
how well do you know laura off the court ? do you talk ever ?
how good do you think she can be ?
what do you know about either of your next opponents ?
so second week of a grand slam in the last four . do you feel much more mentally secure , no nerves whatsoever , you can just go out there and play ?
can you explain to us what happened there in the first set . had you arrived with a problem or did it happen within the match ?
how much did it affect you on your serve , what you could do with your first serve ?
quite a long discussion during the medical timeout . did you consider pulling out ?
do you feel this match was any different than the one in hobart ?
would we be wrong to assume that this is just the initial stages of a long series of the two of you playing against one another ?
you 're both going right up the rankings .
when the trainer was with you , did they know where you hurt ? looked like you were in a lot of distress all down the lefthand side .
the question is , what was the extent of that pain ? it looked like you were in some considerable pain .
what did you think of the support you got out on court today ?
there were some people saying they forced themselves to go watch the seppi and cilic match before yours to make sure they could have a seat for yours . were you surprised to be on such a small court ?
what time did you get to sleep after kvitova and what was the rest day like ?
when did the shoulder start to become an issue ?
after some practice , or did it just come on ?
how does the week sit with you overall ?
you say there are a lot of things you can work on . what in particular ?
is the shot selection a particular issue playing somebody like sloane who gets so many balls back ?
do you think the shoulder pain is just the result of having played 119 in the third the day before , or is it something more serious ?
is next up fed cup or anything in between ?
you obviously were in a lot of discomfort out there .
can you tell us about it ? how were you beforehand ? at what point it happened ? how bad was it after ?
is it a muscle spasm kind of thing ?
they act up ?
you get the treatment . how much better can it be made in the short term ?
do you get sciatica with that ? do you get shooting pain down your leg at all with the herniations ?
was it worse for any particular shots ? your forehand seemed to suffer .
did you surprise yourself how well you played out there on rod laver against the world no.1 ?
what 's the level of pain on a scale of 1 to 10 ?
it peaks as you hit the ball ?
so how difficult is that to take a full swing and to really let rip knowing it 's really going to hurt ?
what 's your plan for how to treat this injury over time ? something you have to take time off for or get something done , fixed ?
you 're not going to miss any tournaments or anything trying to get better ?
this happened at the french open last year ? is this when the herniation occurred ?
what were you thinking today when you started to feel it ? were you thinking , oh , god , not again ?
did you have to change your approach and try and shorten the points ?
recently you have played radwanska . what can you tell us about her game ?
azarenka on court said you were ripping winners and she was obviously impressed with your game . i mean , physical discomfort aside , did you come out of this match feeling you can go toe to toe with anyone ?
have n't been much in the way of upsets in the tournament . going in against the world no.1 , how did you rate your chances ?
you have clearly been hampered in your view ?
what are the options here ? what can be done ? because that 's not a small injury , the herniation . is there some sort of a surgical procedure or something that can be done ? what are your options ?
do you feel like the injury comes up more in big matches ? this sort of tension in that situation , does that hurt your back ?
when you left the court , what did they do ? what was the treatment ?
in the middle of the match ?
massage ?
you hit a pretty outrageous curlingback dropshot at 54. was that a desperation shot or something because you were hurting or something you typically try ?
did you watch madison yesterday ?
what were your impressions of that match ?
tough match for you today . how do you feel after that ?
did she surprise you with the power she was putting on the groundstrokes ?
you did n't play that loose and free . was that because she was so unpredictable and then she got the injury and you did n't really know what was happening with her ?
so in the third set did you feel like you had to play consistent because you knew she was on and off and a little bit hurt ? or did you feel like , i really need to stay up and play more aggressive ?
did you hear the news about the former tennis player , gussie moran passing away ?
she played in wimbledon in 1949 and wore a short skirt ; was one of the first trailblazers in fashion for women 's tennis players .
you do n't know her ?
always tough to play someone you have n't played before , but how would you rate your overall performance ?
no , yours .
what parts of your game can you improve from today ? what do you need to work on ?
what did your coach say after the match ?
little more critical ?
your first two matches you have won in straight sets . what did you feel today when she won the second set ? any nerves going through your mind there ?
yeah .
i guess you have been around enough to know in a twoweek grand slam there are going to be these types of matches and not everything can be perfect now .
how do you prepare for your next match against vesnina or vinci ? that 's not going to be an easier match .
a lot of players have been asked about the lance armstrong interviews . did you see the interview ?
what do you think about the whole situation ?
were you a little bit surprised at the way maria played tonight ? she seemed to be on form out there .
did she play better than you thought ?
what about your own performance ? do you feel you played poorly tonight or it was a matter of maria playing too well ?
do these results motivate you to get back to where you were or is it a kick in of the guts because you 're trying hard ?
obviously not your a game . she was making it hard . at the end of the second set did you feel like you might be getting in there and start to turn things around ?
was there anything in particular in your game that you thought was dissatisfying ?
what is your schedule like from here to miami ?
how did you feel out there in your first round ?
what are some of the positives you 'll take out of your singles tournament ?
on a nontennis note , did you watch any of oprah 's interview with lance armstrong ?
is it something that players are talking about , his confession to doping ?
do you have any reaction ?
this time you got off to a really solid start , did n't you ? you were competing really well at the beginning of that first set .
how difficult is it to read her game ?
when you see what she 's achieved and is achieving , does that give you encouragement that you do n't have to be able to hit the ball like a serena or a maria to get to the very top ?
do you think that when you go up against these very top players , you 're still kind of developing your kind of vision of how exactly you want to go about it ? i know can you beat lesserranked players most of the time , but you 're still working out what your best option and is percentages are ?
how is your elbow ? does it need a bit of a rest ?
how did you feel going out on that court , big match ? you made better start probably than you made in the first two rounds .
how nervous were you ? big match , but it was 11:00 in the morning .
do you feel there is anything specifically you have to work on in your game now to make the next step up , or is it generally ?
when you play someone like agnieszka who has a lot of variety , do you sort of think to yourself , i need to add a little bit of that to my game ? your game is obviously based around consistency and playing the way you play , but do you think you need to mix a little bit up as you go along ?
the points you 've got here could take you as many sort of ten places up . do you feel reasonably satisfied even though you did n't move on today ?
what is next ?
with an 11:00 a.m. start today , did you get an early night last night or did you watch any of laura ?
were you surprised to hear that she had won after what you 'd watched ?
at the last press conference you said there would be no surprises tonight . how surprised were you with at least the first set and a half ?
of the eight you 've now played , only one has gone to three sets . is it a coincidence that it 's fairly decisive one way or the other ?
has much changed about her game ? did you have to do anything differently to prepare for tonight ?
that was a big celebration at the end there . were you thinking about another williams sister in the final at that moment ?
it will be your 17th quarterfinal in a slam if you make it that far .
if you win on sunday .
your 17 quarterfinal shows consistency . but does it show you anything else ?
have you been pressing yourself so far in this tournament ? do you still feel like you have another level to go ?
has that surprised you , how well you have played ?
can you talk about flipkens , your next opponent ?
there was a lot of talk today about the lance armstrong interview . did you catch any of it ?
do you have any thoughts on his admission today , how he justified it as not cheating ?
do you feel tennis is pretty clean at this moment ?
you are thinking about the next match , but you beat venus today . how do you think about the performance of serena williams to win this title ?
have you heard if flipkens had some advice from kim clijsters ?
you have n't dropped a set all season . is this the best start to a year that you 've ever had before ?
what 's made it so good ?
did you do anything different during the offseason than you did n't do before ?
where do you do your fitness work in the offseason ?
how many weeks did you take off at the end of the year and just not pick up a racquet ?
when did you actually start preparing for the new year ?
you have practiced indoors obviously because it 's too ...
so it 's only really practice ? you do n't do any work in a gym ?
would you have maybe preferred a tough threeset match along the way to guide you exactly with your game , or are you happy to just keep doing it quickly ?
what did you do well today ?
do you feel that you 're stepping up your intensity with each match at this tournament ?
do you think there is improvement though with each round ?
is this your best winning streak of your career ?
is 13 an unlucky number in poland ?
are you superstitious ?
what did you do between the end of last season and getting ready for this season ?
you got away to the sunshine ?
how do you discipline yourself to study when you 've been traveling the world and playing in front of huge crowds ? it 's two different worlds .
what are you studying ?
any thoughts only your next opponent ? they 're playing now . it 's jankovic or ivanovic . will you watch ?
good performance out there today . how did it feel for you ?
can you tell us a little , because you have changed coaches , a little more insight in what kind of things you have gained ?
between yourself and carlos , have you got any aims for 2013 , where you 'd like to be ? currently sitting 6. is there an aim that you 've got for the year ?
you look at the top five names above you , you 're confident you can match up with any one of those five at any time ?
many of the players have a particular rival that they see as their main rival . who do you see as the biggest rivalry you have in tennis ?
has your coach helped you stop fighting against yourself ? is that something that carlos has done ?
you looked a bit frustrated at jiang shan today . you said , do this .
yeah ? why ?
in this tournament there are four chinese females in the main draw and one qualifying male . similar proportions in the juniors . in china , is tennis more attractive to the females than the males , do you think ?
you have julia goerges next . you have never played her . will you think to zheng jie to find out ?
ca n't play much better than that , ana ?
what happened in the first set ?
at the service , i mean . you was 52 .
a few years ago that would have been a semifinal maybe a final of a grand slam . does playing her still have the same intensity for you ?
how is your relationship with her now these days ?
there was a bit of an edge there , though , between you two ?
you have an 83 record against her . against some other players you do n't do that well . is it because of the intensity of the rivalry ? is it something special within it that helps you focus more when you play her ?
so you have had a lot of different ways you have approached fitness over the years . now you 're thinner but you look a lot faster . do you feel like movement is much more important to you than maybe upper body strength ?
was it a deliberate decision to lose a little bit of weight ? was that what you were thinking to do ?
do you get more support here with your australian connections than you would at other slams like wimbledon and us open ?
and you still have the uncle in beaumaris ?
mentone . have you caught up with him ?
given the lack of australian representation in the women , i.e. , none , would you be our kind of ...
radwanska has n't lost a set i think in 12 matches . first three times you played her you beat her , and i think she 's won the last four . can you just talk about her development as a player and then the matchup ?
are you playing fed cup or undecided ?
yes ? unless you win the tournament which you 're counting on anyway ?
what happened at the end , last three games ? she was serving for the match and you came back . do you think she trembled ?
did the rain bother you ?
can you talk about how do you think she played today , and also about your next match to play against li na ?
she played a little bit like a very talented but crazy junior . you had to stay in there with her .
did you expect her to miss as much as she did or did you feel like you had to force the play and control it a little bit more ?
did she make you feel old , knowing she 's the same age as when you played first ?
you 've talked about the fun . obviously the sport is more fun when you 're winning . was it fun today ?
how pleased were you with the consistency of your ball striking today ? it looked pretty impressive .
you hit some big serves at times . it 's an important part of your game . you 've been working on it for a few years . if you get in tight matches , you need to come up with that .
is it a little frustrating that last year you were asked about the pressure to back up being no.1 by winning a major , now you 're asked about the pressure to get back to no.1 .
the golf colleague out there .
someone else 's golf who might be playing well at the moment .
you said on the court you were at the physio 's and you were by far the oldest person in there .
are you the oldest youngest player on tour now ?
do you actually feel a generational difference at 22 to a 16 or 17yearold ?
they 're playing a lot of music . you have no idea ? you feel like an old person , that i do n't know that ?
how does this compare with the two big wins you won in newyork ?
what was the emotion when you finally won it ?
what pleased you most about your performance ?
how tough was it because , as you said , it was a match that did n't really have any kind of real rhythm or definition . it must have been hard to keep going because there were n't many rallies . there was no sense of timing a lot of the time .
you were having a few problems with your ball toss towards the end .
is it in some ways more satisfying the fact that it was kind of you did n't play quite as fluidly as you did in newyork and therefore more satisfying ?
was there any moment that you thought this is going to get away from you ? maybe in the first set ?
have you always had that fighting spirit ?
if you think back to last year , i think you played jankovic and it was pretty , i think , maybe a disappointing match for you .
do you think about how far you 've come ? does it startle you at all , or did you always know you would get to this point ?
was that the latest finish you have ever had for a match ?
i was wondering how playing second match on a night session following roger federer , just what your thoughts were and how different it was to have to prepare for a match against a player of her quality for a night session at a grand slam .
what are the particular challenges of playing you know sloane pretty well , do n't you , from juniors and everything ?
what is tough about playing her ? she got the better of you , i think .
how good a player is sloane ? she 's been tipped by a lot of people to go a long way .
how do you come down from this after this sort of obviously you 're tired from having played three hours . there has to be a lot of adrenaline . are you going to be up all night or resting ?
when she makes that noise , is it slightly frightening ?
it frightens me and i 'm miles away from her .
it 's an amazing noise , though , is n't it ?
you might play serena williams for the first time in the third round . can you talk about your thoughts going into that match ?
can you talk about your thoughts ?
what are your goals for this year ? do you have any ranking goals ?
you 're now 72 in the world .
just wondering what your ranking goals are this year .
you came back from 25 , two breaks down , five games in a row .
can you tell me something about your next round ?
can you tell us a little bit about your tennis growing up in china , where you get this fighting spirit ?
where do you learn this fighting spirit ? were you always like this when you were young ?
do you feel like you 're playing well enough to get to the finals again ?
what do you think happened at 52 ? was it you turning your game around or did sam seem to fall away ?
we 've seen your mum on the practice court . can she play tennis ?
did you feel as good out there as you did in your first round ?
next up is maria . you played many times before . what are you expecting out of this match that might be different from previous matches with her ?
she won today 6love , 6love . do you think you have to play better than you 've been playing this week ? how do you feel about that ?
you 've had some big matches against her . any particular matches that stand out to you against her ?
you both are great champions . do you go into the match with a different mentality ? do you need to psych yourself up a little bit more ? not a routine third round .
your doubles partner suffered a little injury scare in her firstround match . have you talked to her about staying in the doubles ?
have you talked to her about the injury today ?
at this stage in your career do you define yourself by wins and losses ? if not , what defines success for you ?
regardless of the result ?
do you still feel going up against an opponent like maria if you bring your best game you will win ?
do you feel more embraced by the public and fans than at any time in your career ?
have you gotten any compliments on your dress ?
what do people say ?
are they like spicy french fries ?
must feel absolutely wonderful to win that .
do you think it would be nice to win a match 62 , 62 ?
do you think the fact that you have been higher ranked than your previous two opponents may be a reason you start off feeling a bit of tension ?
you talked about the supporters making a lot noise . you hugged them afterwards .
what drove you to do that ?
what did you say to them ?
in both matches it 's been when there is a break in the match that you 've been able to find new momentum . it happened with the injuries in the first match , and then today when she took quite a long break at the end of the second . it 's almost as though when you start a match for the second time you 're able to start playing a lot better than you started in the first place .
the way you started the third set today .
do you feel any pressure about the next round ?
radwanska .
what do you remember of playing her at wimbledon last year ?
you obviously had highs and lows in your career . was that sort of quite one of the more sobering experiences of your career ?
yeah .
so it would be quite nice to put it right , i guess .
how do you think you 'll feel tomorrow after today ?
have you spoken to marina . she had a tough loss before you .
do you feel like you and marina can go quite well in doubles ?
did you find it hard having to wait for however many hours it was second match running ?
after the match against radwanska , how did you work with it your coach ? did he sit you down and have a postmortem , or did you wait until the next day ?
how different a player do you feel you are now since last summer when you played her at wimbledon ?
on that first match point today , did you just say ...
hers . did you just say , just keep the ball going ; do n't make a mistake ?
how was your elbow today ?
have you ever experienced such sort of vocal support on court ?
do you remember the last time you saved that many match points and went on to win ? has it happened before ?
after such a long second set and then you find yourself 63 down , was there any moment where you think , i 've blown this ; it 's gone ?
did she leave the court because she was unwell or because she needed the treatment ?
it was a long break .
obviously a disappointing way to finish after fighting back .
was there a problem with the ankle and the balance with the serve ? no problem there ?
what were you thinking when you were 52 up coming out to serve ?
did you find your body language changed during that game ?
how much of it was mental as opposed to physical ?
do you think you choked ?
what was going through your mind at 52 in the third and your opponent getting those games back ?
when you say crazy things come into your head , what do you think ? like , it 's not happening again ?
you pride yourself on fitness . you said a couple times here that you 're tired early in the third set . is your fitness lower than what it should be ?
where to from here ? when people ask you , why is it difficult here , why is it difficult at your home slam , what are you going to say when you get stopped in the supermarket ?
are you planning to have any changes in your game , anything specific to do with what is happening now ?
can you draw any positives out of the game ?
every time facing zheng , you think if you could n't take early control in the game and letting her establish in the rallies , you 're going to be in trouble , you 're going to be struggling a little bit ?
do you feel surprised that zheng jie could fight back with such big disadvantages , like two breaks behind and , 25 down in the third set ?
do you know something about your polish roots ? if i 'm not mistaken , your grandfather was a polish soldier .
can you read or speak any polish ?
have you been watching bernard tomic 's game , and do you have any observations on his game ?
you obviously have a pretty big candy business now , but you 're also making a lot of bagels .
seemed like you wanted this one . in the last game you were getting upset at an incorrect challenge .
there 's no temptation to ease your foot off the gas at any stage in today 's match ?
scoreline aside , how do you feel your own level has been in these first two matches , especially having no matches coming in ?
and if that 's venus , can you talk about that a little bit ?
when you played her in rome , did you find any difference in her level than two or three years ago ?
so you expect what exactly ?
but when you 're playing another great player , is there more intensity to the match than if somebody that does n't have the experience ?
is there any disadvantage to not having faced a little bit of adversity in the first two rounds , losing a few games here or there ?
have you enjoyed your first 48 hours on twitter ?
andy roddick has been doing that . he 's been criticizing commentating since he retired also on twitter .
does it surprise you that you can just say hello on social media and get 200,000 followers just like that ( snapping fingers ) ?
we can see venus on this tv screen here . she has a brightcolored dress on . tricky to make comments . she wore the same dress in her last match . any comment on her fashion statement ?
are you happy with these two bagel matches ? this happened 28 years ago . are you happy with it ?
when you 're at a tournament and some big players or personalities are missing , like a kim or a roddick , do you feel that ? are you still too much in your own thing to sense their absence ?
date was talking about relating to the other generation . clearly she is a lot older than you , but do you find yourself feeling like an older player , and can you relate to the 18yearolds ?
not unexpected given how well you 've been playing . she 's a seeded player . you have to be pretty pleased .
what was the key for you today ?
do you feel different in this slam versus the other ones you 've played in the past ?
what are the differences in terms of when you 're on the court and how that manifests itself ?
i do n't know if you saw lindsay davenport tweeted today that she had n't had hope for a young american like you since serena williams . how does that make you feel to get that kind of compliment ?
no nerves at all . have you felt any real nerves going on court ?
when you were 14 , you had that win in ponte vedra , and then you were at the french open , the wild card , and you had a stomach muscle pull . how long did that take you out ? took a while to heal , did n't it ?
you have kerber next round , a topfive player . a little bit different approach or just go out and try to rip it ?
so both your parents are lawyers , right ?
both still working ?
how did you get from lawyers ' kid , especially two working lawyers , to become a tennis player at this level ?
so you got addicted pretty quickly ?
first time ?
went home and said , i got to play tennis every day ; get me lessons ?
your parents do n't play ?
what initially attracted you when you saw tennis for the first time ?
who were your tennis idols growing up ? who did you like to watch ?
how old were you when you started , picked up the racquet for the first time ?
how much of the transition , adjustment , i mean , you switched from chris to the usta , but it 's on the same property . was there a big adjustment or ...
do your parents watch you play ? are they watching on tv now ?
they 're watching you online ?
do they get nervous ?
any chance they 're going to come over if you advance a little bit further ?
how was that ? looked pretty methodical and straightforward for you . happy with the win ?
obviously we saw you last year have a big breakthrough into the top 10. got couple of your first two big singles wins . your thoughts on this year , this open , what you can do here ?
how much confidence did last year give you in terms of , you know , just overall with your career ? you must come into this year feeling very strong and upbeat about what you can do .
have you looked ahead to your next match ?
you 're obviously happy with how you played today .
you 've done very well here in the past . you came close to making the quarterfinals a year or two ago . is melbourne park a place that you like the conditions in and you feel comfortable here ?
does that increase your motivation this year ?
what did you take from your match against her in wimbledon ? how are you going to approach it differently ?
did you do anything different in your offseason to train ?
tell us how you felt out on the court . are you happy with the win ?
you were yelling at yourself a bit behind the baseline in the second set . i suppose that 's how much you want the win , having high standards for yourself .
not many people play the way she does with the slice forehand . how is that to deal with ?
do you almost feel like you need to go out and practice a little bit to get more rhythm after playing someone like that ?
did you get much of a reception from the australian crowds today ?
there 's been a warm forecast for thursday , up to 39 degrees . does that concern you at all ?
obviously your injury was no joke and you were honest and said where it came from . that word 'pedicure ' is going to follow you around a bit . do you wish you just said you had a generic toe injury ?
you probably heard that serena had an injury today , but still won . suppose you ca n't be worried about other players , but have you heard anything about her ?
she rolled her ankle .
do you know much about the possible two opponents you might face in the next round ?
have you looked at the draw at all ?
is it nice to walk around the corridors and see photos of yourself from last year ?
is there any difference being a defending champion in the buildup to a grand slam ?
do you like to stay around the tournament after your matches or go back to your apartment ?
you mentioned you do n't look at the draw . do you not even know who is in your half of the draw ?
not one player ?
have you always been like that ?
that may be the best match you 've played at a slam since your comeback . would you agree with that ?
what did you do in the off season to get yourself physically the way you want to coming into this year ?
but you had enough energy and your body was responding the way you wanted it to ?
this is the kind of match in the past that you would have expected yourself to win . it would have been routine to win . did it feel at all that way today ?
how encouraging was the hopman cup for you ? speaking of time on court , you had a lot of time on court that one day . just getting through that , was that important ?
are you still trying to maintain that kind of vegan whatever diet ?
what do you get to cheat with when you get to cheat ?
you have been coming down here for a long time . how has this tournament changed in your eyes ?
i think this is the 18th season you have gone into as a player . talk about your nongeneric goals . i 'm sure they have changed since , you know , '94 to '95 .
of venus .
have you made up your mind about fed cup yet ?
yeah . are you going to play in italy ?
100 % ?
you 've got the win today , but what have you taken away from the match from a performance perspective and to build on moving forward ?
i have heard hisense is a lot slower than the outer courts that maybe you practiced on also . did you sense that at all today ?
speaking of fed cup , have you enjoyed the contact with some of the younger americans on the team and the olympics and some of the other team events you have played on ?
do you feel them looking up to you ?
a couple of miami tournament questions . they made a few improvements last year , temporary , but they have pretty much been okayed to revamp the site and everything . you have been going there . it 's your home tournament . how important do you think it is for them to kind of upgrade that facility ?
of the 13 players who have won that event , all but three have been no.1s in the world at some point in their career . all but radwanska has won at least one grand slam . you 're part of that , obviously . is that an impressive lineup for a tournament to have ?
how much more patient has the illness forced you to be in the last year or two ?
when you come here , what match do you think of , if you think of any matches ? final against serena maybe ?
that was justin ?
and that 's the only title he ever had , too .
was winning a couple of those doubles tournaments last year . like wimbledon , the olympics , kind of turned things around for you , to say , hey , i really can come back and do this ?
where are those gold medals ?
how has it gone for you ? athletes say all the time that the years fly by . so much has happened to you .
must be pretty proud of that .
was your elbow giving you fits ?
what was the treatment you had ?
when the trainer came out .
it seemed to help that she called the trainer . she waited a few minutes , then called the trainer . it gave you recovery time .
had you felt like that all day ?
could it just be something like , because you have n't played for a little while , not frustration , but you 're waiting to play , perhaps you get a little too nervous about the occasion and it all gets to you a little bit ?
when did you actually start cramping ?
you 've had some quite tough draws .
when you get what is a fairly decent draw , did you feel quite a lot of pressure that you needed to capitalize ?
do you know pervak , have you had much to do with her ?
was the crowd very helpful today ?
one of the best atmospheres you 've played in ?
the problem you had last week , the elbow problem , was that a oneoff or what ?
and what have the doctor or trainer said to you about the elbow longterm ? do you think it 's going to be a problem ?
are you serving at full power ?
it 's a new year . i know you take stock in the offseason . is there anything going forward that you 're going to try to do differently this year to achieve your goals ?
are you going to have to cut out any sort of nice things that you 're particularly fond of ?
all year ?
was that your mum i saw ?
she 's not here ?
do you think the conditions here actually do suit the way you want to play and the way you 'd like to play ?
was it a surprise to you after that break how much the match completely changed ?
were you worried at that point , before you called the trainer ?
does it help to finish your mindset since you won that title ?
do you think you can beat anyone ?
would that have been the most pressure you have had in the first round of a grand slam tournament today ?
do you feel like a fridge has been lifted off your shoulders ?
did you free up in the second set after winning the first ? you looked to play a lot more loosely , having won a set ?
you said previously that you had progressed even with the losses through the start of the year . was this another progression today , do you feel ?
do you feel like you 're a long way off your best ?
i know you say you do n't watch the newspapers and watch the tv , but i 'm sure you have heard the comments made about your tennis , talking in the corridor . what 's your feeling about that ? grateful for the advice but you 'll just do your own thing ?
was it the first serve , a bit of a problem today ?
take us down the court level a bit . was it a bit tricky with the wind ? seemed both players struggled for a little bit for continuity .
she had some lovely downtheline forehands and backhands . she was n't missing too many of those .
probably go match to match like everybody does . you 're probably aware that li na is in your top section . will you watch a little bit of her match ?
your prospective match , your second round , does someone have a look at that match for you ?
what do you have to do better than you did in brisbane and sydney ?
sounds like you have a cold , a little nasally . a bit of pollen on the court ?
i take it the rust did n't hurt too much out there ?
you have now gotten a double bagel win at every slam . it completes your double bagel slam or calendar slam . is that something you 're proud of ?
you do n't get any extra satisfaction out of 00 ?
did you take anything from today as far as what you want to work on maybe the next couple of days as far as you felt like you did something really well or that you were n't necessarily happy with ?
you got through round one in 55 minutes without losing a game . must be a wonderful feeling for you . are you already aware that venus williams played five more minutes and lost only one game ?
you are n't aware that you may have to face her in the third round ?
on the court it 's cold or hot ?
what 's your feeling ?
yeah , i watched .
cold .
could you just summarize the way you played out there ? was it a bit of a surprise in the first set , do you think ?
the last two tournament wins have obviously been great . what sort of confidence does that give you coming into this tournament ?
can you talk about your match today , how this feels different from last year 's defeat ? how does it feel to be back here ?
was it hard playing today ? it was quite cold , about 20 degrees , and last week in sydney it was about 40 degrees one of the days you played .
you have olga govortsova next . you played her twice and won both times . have you got thoughts about the next round ?
what was carlos ' advice today about how to approach the first round of the grand slam ?
do you feel more confident with him this year ?
how did you feel out there ? pretty convincing win .
are you icing something there right now ?
one of the matches that got a lot of attention when the draw came out was a thirdround match possibly between you and ana ivanovic . have you thought about that match ?
what is your coaching situation now ?
what 's his name ?
are you happy with your performance today ?
how do you feel about the second round ?
with preparation , the beginning of the year , do you feel you can go to the end in a grand slam like this ?
how do you feel your serve is going at the moment ? are you feeling confident with it ?
your ankle is okay ?
what were your thoughts on the match today ?
does that give you confidence moving forward ?
is it part of being in that situation of being a set up , nerves of being in the australian open , come into play today ?
what sort of lesson can you take from a match like that ?
big crowd play into your nerves today ?
are you going to go away and have a look at that game ?
are you still happy you still have a chance to get out in front of the home crowd playing doubles ?
what are your goals for 2013 now ?
caroline said that you played pretty much perfect . that 's more or less how it looked except for parts of the first part with the forehand .
do you feel like you were playing as well as you did to start off in australia ?
she was able to beat you a few times a few years ago and frustrate you , move you around . what do you think you were able to do to turn around these matchups that helped it go so decisively in your favor today ?
adding to that , though , on the move today you were hitting not just winners but balls back deep even when she got you going side to side . your defense played a part , too , no ?
the no.1 ranking looks like it might flicker between the three of you a little bit . how important is no.1 ? how important are slams ? how good is it to get a title this early ?
there is another question you have never been asked before . fabulous day , a fabulous run here , maria , but still some problems with the game of serena and li na . what do you think can you do in your game in terms of facing up with them ?
you fell a little bit short in the final here last year . did that give you more motivation to get the job done this year ?
reflect on the difference between winning today and then the first time you won this tournament . seems like a different generation of players on the tour and stuff like that . it 's been so long .
can you tell us about the field ? the field feels so much different now than 2006 .
i talked to your trainer a couple of days ago , and he said the biggest improvement you made might be movement , running side to side . do you feel that way ?
can you talk about risktaking a bit ? when you 're playing superaggressive and it 's going well , like today , i 'm sure you say , hit , hit , hit , but if it 's not playing well , do you say to yourself , play with more margins or this is how i 'm used to playing and this is the only way i can win ?
it did look like it . caroline said so .
obviously we know that you 're very good with what you do on court . if you go off court , what is it that you do n't do well or you ca n't do that you would really like to do well ?
singing ?
when you talk about your kind of aggressive game , which you discussed over the week , how much of that , looking back , is the game that was taught to you versus the game that kind of is your game and it 's an expression of what you kind of want to do on the court in terms of taking control of points as opposed to being more of a counterpuncher or defensive grinder or something ?
you seemed to break new ground oncourt tweeting today .
broke new ground with oncourt tweeting today .
not a lot of people do that between the match and the ceremony ?
i presume it 's not quite the way you 'd like to get through .
how did you learn that vika was not going to play ?
had you heard that she was possibly going to pull out , or was it a surprise ?
will you do some more today ?
what will you do the rest of the day ?
angelique , how do you see the match ?
it 's going to be very hot . who do you think it 's going to favor ?
sort of a strange situation . you sometimes have one player getting a walkover and has that extra time , but it 's both players on this occasion . it should n't necessarily be favoring one or the other .
what is your prediction for tonight 's match ?
what is it like to prepare for a match and then have the opponent withdraw ? is it a little exciting because you do n't have to take the court , or is it frustrating because you prepared and did n't get to play ?
what 's your reaction to that walkover ? are you happy or are you wishing you had a match ?
how much does that throw you off your rhythm ? you know , you get up , prepare for a match , you go through your stretching , your training , and then it happens . that kind of knocks your rhythm off , does n't it ?
on the other hand , you 're not out in that hot sun today , so that 's kind of a good thing , is n't it ?
obviously one less match under your belt , but your opponent is in the same position , which is very strange .
how do you see the match ? you beat her three times last year .
there was talk before about rafa had said all these hardcourt matches early in the year , eventually they 're going to take their toll on people like victoria and stuff . do you think they play too much hard court in the beginning of the year ?
at what point did you know you could not play today ?
are you able to just to tell us exactly what they 're saying what it is at the moment , or is it pretty complex ?
is it a constant ache or throb or what sort of pain is it ? is it when you put your shoes on or when does it really get worse ?
when did you first feel it ?
yeah , when did the first feeling ...
how frustrated are you by it , victoria ?
by the very nature of the tour , a large percentage of tournaments now are played on hard courts . rafael nadal has said many times that long term we are going to suffer the consequences of playing so much hard court tennis . i know it 's a long and involved discussion at the moment , but do you tend to agree with that , that we perhaps need to look at the percentage balance of the tournaments played on hard and those played on grass ?
is it too early to determine how much time you need off at the moment ? i 'm assuming you you 're still planning on playing miami .
as far as treatment is concerned , is it a matter of just raising it , you know , resting it ? are you having to tape it ? is it ice ? splint ? what do you need done ?
where are you going now ? are you going to stay here or go somewhere else ? miami ? where are you going to try to heal your ankle ?
was yesterday 's mri the first you had on the ankle since the pain first emerged ?
that revealed the main problem ?
on the bright side , your voice is less husky . that 's improving .
tough start ; fairly easy finish . talk about your form and the conditions and her and you .
and you .
looks like you 're going to be playing four straight kind of counterpunching baseliner types .
exactly . no doubt .
you know errani 's game , but she seems to be playing well this year . she 's pretty consistent , no ?
i presume that you prefer playing someone like that where you can dictate play to an opponent who might a little bit erratic , or not ?
kvitova said that the surface is actually playing like clay , not just slowwise but because there are different bounces all the time . she said she is not getting the same bounces all the time . do you feel that ?
takes slice and it takes topspin ?
she said different bounces .
how much more comfortable are you as a slowcourt player maybe than you were earlier ? obviously some of your biggest results lately have come on clay .
do you think it 's about patience during rallies ? is that something you learned over your career ?
what are you reading these days ?
that 's it ?
so just a businesswoman , no novels , no nonfiction ?
did you finish [ ] orwell 's 1984 ?
found it disturbing ?
how do you keep this from ever getting old ?
after all this time , do you still learn something about the game or yourself every time you play a match ?
you 're in another quarterfinal . you have been remarkably consistent the last several months getting into the latter stages of tournaments . can you talk about that a bit ?
how do you avoid those early match upsets and coming up flat , things like that ?
was that a sugarpova slogan you wrote on the camera today ?
twitter handle on there or something ?
why do you sign it ?
do you remember someone actually telling you , go sign the camera ?
routine ?
stamp it . start a trend , just stamp it with something .
i think some of us were worried before the match how you 're going to handle the heat . it 's pretty hot today . but you seemed to come through very well . how did you feel out there ?
do you have to change sort of the way you approach your workouts or your day or anything when it goes from being sort of mild and temperate to hot like it is now the next few days ?
since the us open last year you have been playing very well on outdoor hard courts . can you say why ?
is it all physical or was there a point where you thought , well , mentally i know i 'm not going to feel well so maybe i 'm not going to play my best ?
you went and won wimbledon and got a lot of attention , and it seems like now more recently you 're kind of flying under the radar maybe with less attention . do you prefer that , or do you kind of miss getting ...
you did n't have the big title last year , but you won fed cup . so i 'm wondering , do you feel like that kind of experience helped you coming into this season , or is there no relation ?
yeah .
what about for you coming here ? you had the upset last year , you lost early , so does it give you that extra boost of confidence now to be into the quarterfinals ?
you have talked a lot about how important consistency is for you , so what do you do to keep yourself consistent week to week ?
so there were times when you were playing lower players when you were n't able to focus as much maybe because you thought , i should win this ?
you 're in the quarterfinals now ; do you think you 're ready to win this tournament ?
the surface here is a bit slow , no ? but the weather is hot and the balls maybe are lighter . does it suit you ? is it fast in some ways and slow in others ?
tough few matches for you , all going three sets and everything like that . how are you doing physically ?
talk about the match today against agnieszka . obviously a very good win . you played her tough before and played her well before . what was the difference in the match today ?
when you play a player like that who has so much variety and then deals a lot with placement and things like that , in your head are you thinking , i need to be more aggressive ; i need to take the match to her ?
so your next match against petra , big hitter , very different .
yeah , exactly . she can be a little bit inconsistent sometimes . she hits a big ball , and sometimes it goes in and sometimes it goes out of the stadium . so when you play a player like that , how do you mentally prepare ?
you have had a very strong last year and a half , two years . before you were kind of outside the top 20 , outside the top 25 , top 30 ; now you 're right there kind of knocking on the door of top 10 and things . when you look back on it , what do you think is the difference ?
do you think it 's stronger mentally or physically ?
did the doubles help with that ? because you play , i think , with more variety now than maybe you did , you know , two , three years ago .
when you come up against a player like petra she has a big game how do you rate her power on the tour ? like no.2 behind serena , or is she right up there with serena ? are there other players that hit the ball bigger than she does ?
how do you feel about the way you 're playing so far ? that looked pretty good out there today .
is it a guessing game ? when it 's hot , ball flies a bit quicker , or ...
is there any other place where it 's that widely different with the conditions ?
you were playing obviously very well today . do you feel like you 're starting to get more good feelings on the matches than maybe last year so far ?
can you talk about the pros and cons of having a parent as a coach and whether anything is different this time around since you tried out some other coaches and brought your dad back ?
does it affect your relationship at all ? any difference now than when he 's not coaching you ?
your brother has n't been traveling you with much . what 's he up to these days ?
does it feel different without him around ? he used to travel a lot with you .
is he the one who scouts football , caroline ?
it 's an issue that tends to be more identified with men than the women about the time between points . there has been some discussion about maybe putting a shot clock , you know , a clock on the court . would you object to that ? what 's your view on it ?
do you have a theory as to why the women tend to play quicker ? you have long rallies as well , do n't you ?
you obviously have had success on all surfaces , but is there one that 's most physically demanding for you ?
do you think it 's softer than it used to be , the courts ?
is rory going to be joining you this week ?
i think you have been here seven years . starting to feel very familiar ? do you feel now like a veteran on the tour ? which tournament is going to feel more familiar ?
anything special you 're working on with your dad now that your dad is back coaching for you ?
14 down in that second set , you said courtside that you were told by your coach , have belief in yourself ; keep focusing . at what point did he tell you that ?
at what stage in the second set did he tell you that ?
at 14 ?
must be nice to get some wins under your belt after a tough middle east swing for you . so how is your confidence going into the rest of the tournament ?
and the back is 100 % now ? like can you go out there and play and not think about it ?
it 's supposed to start to get hot this week . you can feel it today a bit . do you change your routine at all , or what sort of in your mindset shifts as the weather gets warmer ?
what about when it gets even hotter ?
did you feel the earthquake this morning ?
what did you do right to get back into the match , and then what did she do right maybe to finish it off ?
then what changed ? did she do something in the third , or did you ...
now that you have been out here a little bit , what in your mind do you think you need to do better to be in , say , the top 20ish area eventually and maybe top 10 ?
it 's your first pro season . to prepare for it during the offseason , what did you do that was maybe different than obviously you have done before ?
is there anything you take out of this particular tournament ? what do you take away ?
were there any offcourt interaction that made you feel more welcome , or are you just talking about how you felt sort of on the court ?
most of the players have come up through juniors and are pros . you took time off and were at stanford . is it hard socially jumping into the pro tour , or do you have friends at the usta or the other americans or something ?
what are the upsides so far ?
have you got your eye on any tournaments around the rest of the year you 're looking forward to , some experiences ?
when you 're here on your own and you 're organizing warmups and all this , do you feel college equipped you well to multitask and do that kind of thing ?
did you take a lot of geography ? do you know where to fly to get to some of these places that you 're going to have to go ?
there was a serbian player last week who flew into the wrong sandiegoin new mexico and did n't know why there were no tennis players when she got off the plane .
no regrets ? do n't miss stanford at all ?
will you stay here or go right to miami , or do you know what you want to do yet ?
last year in this tournament , in our research center , we showed that men only had 2.2 seconds between hits now on ground rallies . women are only 2.5. very close . only 300 milliseconds behind the men . but there was a large discrepancy on the serve . do you think the women will ever catch up like that on the serve with the men ?
how do you account for the groundstrokes being so close to the men now ?
serena has a male hitting partner . would you ever go that way on a permanent basis ?
what sort of things do you like to read ?
what 's your take on her game ?
you have played against a bunch of the young americans ; played against sloane and now her . obviously you 're in the u.s. wondering which one is going to be ... do you sense of the young american crop how they 're coming along and which one is maybe ahead and i guess what 's the sense of that group in the locker room ?
seems like you got pretty good crowd support today against an american in america . how do you feel about that ?
how did you feel about the way you played today ? there was potentially going to be a very tough match for you .
do you like the conditions here and the court surface ?
sounds like a good scenario you 're in .
what do you learn from a day like today , competing on a big court and then in this atmosphere against a player like sam who has a grand slam title ?
do you walk away feeling like , yeah , i belong there ; it 's just a couple of little things ?
when you play these matches against the top women , what 's the gap that you see ? like when you look at your game and say , okay , the first thing that comes to mind is like , i 've got to get better . is it consistency or ...
on the nerves issue , is that something that you kind of always , you know , had like when you were a junior as well , or is this more just now that you 're a pro and playing these top girls is that when you 're feeling it ?
did you feel like the crowd was there was some discussion whether it was more for her or you , and thinking , well , it should be promadison because it 's america . but then sam is a us open winner . did you even notice ?
this tournament , would you call it a success for you basically , what you 've done here so far ? does it make you feel positive about the rest of the season ?
everyone wants to make it to a grand slam . how important was it to win the aussie open playoff ? i think you beat mallory in the final , if i remember correctly .
we 're still getting to know you as both a player and a person , but just what makes you special ? what , as a person , is the most interesting thing about you ?
your favorite country music performers are ?
top three or four will do .
how did you not become a lawyer ? with two parents who were a lawyer , did they ...
how did your parents come up with the name madison ?
has that bothered you psychologically over the years you have been named after a mermaid ?
did you watch the movie ever ?
who was the star ?
here 's a good segue : how much of a splash do you think you made in australia ? and with all the attention you drew , how did that feel to you that you had such accolades in the american media ?
what 's your dream ? what do you hope to do eventually in this game ?
how did you feel about the crowd out there today , the support for you ?
how tall are you now ? have you grown at all in the last year ?
if you had a favorite breakout slam , which , in your heart of hearts , would you like to win first ?
outside of listening to every country music station that 's on the radio , what do you do on your off time when you 're not killing yourself on the court ?
you 're not in high school ? are you doing ...
are you homeschooled ?
how close are you to finishing that ?
so you will be a senior ?
favorite goto dish bakingwise ?
is that the one you put on your facebook ?
so when you break through and win a big , big tournament , will you promise to give us a round of cheesecake ?
ever tried sugarpova before ?
can you imagine getting a little of maria 's candy into your baking ?
for an australian warmup it 's been a perfect week . would that be a description ?
do you have any complaints about the match ? it was almost perfect for you . you served well ; returned well ; groundstrokes were good .
you won 20 of 22 first serve points .
yeah .
explain what it feels like when you 're in a zone . does it feel like every shot is going to be perfect ?
there is a zone athletes talk about . have you found yourself getting in that ?
you 've won 35 of your last 36 matches ; is this your career zone ?
what elements have you added ? obviously being fit and injuryfree is one ; experience is another . is there anything else you think you 've added the last 12 , 18 months ?
have you done anything to help with that ? meditation ?
is n't there , too , a fine line between being calm and keeping your intensity level up ?
what was it like for you on court when the person you just beat in the final says publically , i feel like when i play you i do n't know how to play tennis ? how did you take that kind of compliment ?
we do n't see you for a week . are you training every day ? anything you 'll throw in ? take a day off and do a bit of sightseeing ?
are you playing doubles with venus ?
you 've played 12 australian opens ; this will be your 13th ; you won five titles . is there a match or moment that you really love about melbourne that might not necessarily be winning the championship ?
how do you avoid going in there overconfident giving how well you 've played since june ?
this run started back just after the french open when you joined patrick 's academy there . what has he brought to your game ? is it the calming influence ?
you 're an elite athlete . will you allow yourself a little champagne or jack daniels on ice tonight ?
can you compare how you feel today leaving here versus last year when you left here with the injury and all the uncertainty ?
are you growing an awesome affinity with brisbane ? your presence here is important for a young tournament . is this the best way to start your year , do you think ?
there has been rumors about your relationship with patrick and photos from mauritius . is there more to the story that you would like to share today ?
a little bit hard on yourself at the end when you said when you play serena she makes you feel like you do n't know how to play tennis . was that a bit hard ?
you 've seen her work closely in mauritius recently .
what is it she does that 's so different to everyone else ? how do you think she can play as she does ?
do you think when she 's playing like that there is anyone on the women 's tour that can beat her , or is she a level above when she 's playing that well ?
you said you started well . what happened at 32 ? did she step up another gear ?
when your coach came on after the first set , what did you talk about ? what did he tell you to try and do or focus on ?
it 's hard to hang in a point with her and wait for her to make a mistake because she gets every ball back , and she gets every ball back with interest , yeah ?
do you feel a little bit deflated now ? do you feel encouraged too ? you got to a final in the first tournament of the year .
serena did have a little bit of a dry spell , and then she joined patrick after the french open . what do you think in that sort of relationship has changed her mentality or approach to the game and made her start winning again ?
what exactly is the injury ?
what action was that ?
which toe exactly ?
yes , but which toe ?
what kind of surgery was it ?
on the nail somewhere ?
so did they take the nail out ?
ouch .
so was it something that was growing or something that just went into the toe ?
so did he call it an ingrown toenail ?
did you try and warmup with it today on the back courts ?
so the doctor told you it 'll take three or four days to heal ?
what does it mean for your australian open preparation then . will you be concerned ?
so you 're not concerned that you might not be as prepared as you would like to be for melbourne ?
are you taking antibiotics ?
he prescribed that starting yesterday ?
so did he say when you were getting the pedicure that the person that was doing it cut you or something like that ?
first time you 've had any kind of toe issue ?
you been able to speak to serena at all ? was she there when you withdrew ?
you won the tournament here a few years ago . do you feel disappointed that there are 5,000 fans up there waiting the see the match of the tournament ?
she pushed you a little bit , but you won the important points when you needed to , no ?
i guess you guys had n't played before but had practiced a handful of times . did she show you something you were n't expecting ?
i think you said on the court that one day she could be the best player in the world .
what do you think she needs to do to get to that point , whenever that will be ?
was that the kind of hitout that you need before tomorrow 's match with victoria ?
looked like at one point you were rubbing your calf . was it a cramp ? can you tell us about that ?
but it feels all right now ? the calf is okay ?
is it exciting to meet the top players for you ? what sort of emotions do you go through when you know you 're playing a top player in a big tournament ?
i know you 're being complimentary toward her , but i think you 've won 35 of your last 36 matches , which is pretty consistent , too , no ?
you also beat her five times last year .
yeah .
talk about the matchup a little bit . she played you very tough at the us open .
so how much fun was it to be in mauritius ? first time for you , huh ?
you were doing karaoke with pavlyuchenkova she said .
she said you guys were doing old songs she did n't know well .
so hingis can sing ?
wow .
absolutely .
how satisfying was that ? such a competitive , highquality match .
overall you felt you played very well , sort of well , or ...
so she sort of did the serena williams where she pulled out the big serve whenever she needed it , huh ?
is it exciting or intimidating meeting someone like serena ?
i do n't know if you could hear the postgame interview serena gave , but in it she said she thinks you will one day be the best player in the world . how does that make you feel to hear your idol say that about you ?
did you have any trouble with your abdominal injury tonight at all ?
can you hit the ball any harder than that ? it was pretty impressive .
were you joking after the first set when you said she 's being a little disrespectful with the , c'mons ?
did she say anything to you ? did you have a chance to talk in after the match ?
are you going to sydney next week ?
get more blankets .
couple good matches here ; played well tonight . you have to be fairly optimistic about the next couple weeks , huh ?
it 's close .
you tell her already ?
what are your expectations when you get to melbourne ? you 've been there once before . where do you see yourself sitting amongst some of these players at a grand slam .
so two very good wins in a row for you . she 's a good defensive player , and you hung in there even though it was a little up and down towards the end , no ?
so the tiebreaker was pretty good , too . no unforced errors . i think you hit five winners and she was trying to rally , but it seemed like you were the calmer player out there .
in tight match which could have gone either way , what do you tell yourself to be able to stay mentally calm under that sort of pressure ?
do you think she might have been a bit down after that two and a half hour match she had yesterday ? do you think her recovery had n't been enough ?
so you had a very difficult year last year . a lot of downs , a few ups . i know you went back to mouratoglou . what did you work on in the offseason ? looks like your fitness is better ; you were calmer . what do you tell yourself to do ? just talk about that a little bit .
so you 're working with hingis at patrick 's a little bit ?
did she say anything that was particularly helpful to you ?
i think you broke into the top 50 in 2008 ; you 're 36 now . what do you think you need to do to get in the top 25 ?
did you hit at all with serena or get to know her a little bit ?
singing ?
what did you sing ?
so was it good or not so good ?
so the coach bremond , did you work with him before at patrick 's , or is this new for you ?
look ahead to the semis . probably not the opponent you expected tomorrow .
no . probably not who you expect to play . how do you approach it ?
fairly convincing scoreline .
as melbourne draws closer , that sort of result must be reassuring for you .
and you wo n't be in sydney ?
is there any reason why you chose brisbane over sydney ? last year worked so well for you .
talking about a strong field , there is a chance you 'll play serena next . thoughts about playing her potentially .
you 've played her 12 times now . have you learned something different every time you played her ?
how hard is it to return her first serve ? you 've played a lot of good servers . she obviously can hit it hard , but i guess there are some different things about it that make it tough to get back in play . does she spot it well where it 's hard to read ?
today in the second set , in the fourth game , you yelled out during a point .
there was a notable yell from you during a point .
i 've never heard you do it before . do you remember the point ? you were hitting a lob ; before pervak hit it you yelled . it was a sort of noise .
were you in pain at all ? did you do anything ? is that why you yelled ? something jarred in your leg ?
sloane stephens was saying yesterday she thinks as great as serena is , that it 's inevitable that her winning streak will eventually end . do you feel that way ?
but you 're playing her .
but you 've been around sport enough to know that someone can not win forever , right , regardless of how good you are ?
given your record against serena it 's been quite a few years since you have beaten her do you think you need to beat her here so you have that confidence that you can do it in a grand slam ?
pretty hot conditions out there . what do you do in in your recovery ? do you do ice baths ? just drink fluids ? massage ?
do you find yourself getting more pumped up playing other elite players , or do you just treat them like the top 40 , top 50 player ?
what i 'm saying is emotionally when you 're going out to play another great player , do you get more excited about that ?
so , two matches ; you had n't played since us open . talk about how you feel , your rhythm and all that .
happy new year , by the way . i spent mine on a plane .
so how bad was the ab injury ? it was the ab , right ?
so when did it exactly heal ? when were you 100 % ? december ? late november ?
serena came in yesterday i think and said she was a fan of your game . how does that make you feel ?
have you hit with her before ?
do how do you go on court ? you 've gotten to know her pretty well over the last year and you realize how well she 's been playing the last year . obviously you have a lot of ability , but she 's been at a really good level . do you go out with confidence , nothing to lose , or do you say , this is serena ; she may be too good for me now ?
but you 've admired and talked about her , and sometimes it 's not easy to play your heroes , no ?
does it give you a lot confidence having somebody with serena 's profile noticing your game ?
could you get better preparation going into a major than playing someone like serena ?
what are your aspirations for two 2013 ?
in terms of ranking , is there any goal in mind ?
it also brings pressure . you 've been mentioned as the next generation coming through . do you feel pressure ?
what happens if you were to knock her over tomorrow ?
she 's lost one match since french open , which is a long streak . what does she do particularly well ?
i was n't here yesterday .
i know what she does well .
what do you see as your main strength going into the match against serena ?
how much confidence does that give you just the way you fought back today ?
in your preparation for a major , is it better to have such a tight result like that than to sweep through pretty easily ?
was it a pretty big surprise ? you really did n't know what that expect today ?
what was the most difficult ? her serve ?
talk about that breakback game in the third set . you said you were down 14. you held your serve and then won that massive rally to get back in . what were you thinking at that stage ?
obviously extremely disappointing . the difference seemed to be night and day between the first and second set . can you just take us through the second set ?
does it feel like a missed opportunity , more like you lost rather than she won ?
did you get some encouragement though from the third set ?
antonio seemed to be saying to you , just keep the ball in play . that was a pretty strong message coming through .
is the hard thing about what you 're trying to do here in making your comeback just having patience , knowing it might not come straightaway , but you have to let it build over time ?
do you feel a little bit more at peace personally though having had your family with you the last few weeks after the sort of terrible times lately ?
have you received a wildcard for the open yet ?
so you 're from here going to hobart , is it ?
you must be confident of one if you 're not playing quallies ?
yeah , but the australian open ?
you certainly had to absorb a lot of heavy groundstrokes in this match . how did you mentally take control of it , do you think ?
you said you wanted to feel where you were after the first match after the offseason . are you where you thought you would be ? do you feel comfortable with your game ?
is playing someone like her a good preparation for a potential matchup with someone like serena ?
with serena playing so well at the moment , how confident are you of defending your world no.1 ranking over the next six weeks ?
you won sydney and melbourne last year . what is it about australia ? the court ? the heat ?
during the offseason after vacation , how much time do you spend looking back , or do you pretty much say , okay , the season is over ; i 've just got to look forward ?
really ?
anything major , or just little things that you need to do ?
sabine , her serves were coming 190 kilometers .
is that the hardest serve you 've faced after serena 's serve ?
so when you got on the plane to here did you feel very refreshed ?
were you thinking , i 'm the defending champion in australia , and that was your first slam , so now i get to defend a grand slam title , which is sort of a good thing ?
you sound like you 're someone that enjoys the expectations and being on center court ; is that fair ?
how much have you changed since four years ago ? you came here and just broke into the top 20 but had n't won a title then . you were still only 19 .
hi . congratulations on your win . your serving games were excellent tonight . talk about how that helped you pull out the victory today .
at the beginning of the second set , the first game you lost your serve and seemed to be a little bit in pain . not sure if that 's just what i saw or if there was any issue . then she called for the trainer , and i had no idea that she was in pain in any way . did you have any idea that she was having problems , and do you have any ?
it 's your tenth title of the year . you have won two grand slams and taking back the no.1 ranking at 31 years old . could you consider it is arguably the best season in your career you have ?
one of the best or the best ?
taking into account those achievements this year and also the fact that you claimed this title not dropping a single set , are you still being challenged enough , do you think , at the top of your game ?
couple players have commented on the conditions here in beijing , the air and all of that . do you feel it at all when you play ?
your fastest serve tonight was just ten kilometers slower than djokovic 's . how do you feel your serve gives you an advantage on the women 's tour ?
what do you think is the best memory you can take away from beijing this year ?
what 's next ? how are you going to prepare for istanbul ? what are your plans for the next two weeks ?
this year when you play against the top 20 players you only lost two matches to vika . do you feel you are unbeatable for the other girls ?
i know you said venus is your greatest opponent , so i wonder , is anyone else for you so threaten ? is there anyone else that can threaten you on the court except venus ?
you talk about istanbul . have you decided what you 're going to wear in the player welcome parties ?
you seemed to pull up with some sort of injury in the second set . could you give us some details about that .
it seemed like you really dictated the pace the entire match , even if you were down a few points . can you speak to that at all ?
we heard little bit of talk about the pollution in the air in beijing and that the levels are very high . do you feel anything , or do you feel like it 's just normal ?
my question is irrelevant to the match today . i want to ask something about the psycho serena . in the documentary of venus and serena , you said you had different personalities that live inside your body . there 's someone called megan and there 's summer diaz who got divorce and stayed in england . there 's takwanda who surprised everybody back in 2009 us open . my question is , which one is more close to the real serena , and who am i talking to right now here in beijing ?
you 've struggled against serena your whole career . can you talk about what makes her so difficult ?
did the medical timeout affect you at all ?
what do you think did n't work out for you today : the serve ? the baseline ? or even dropshots ? anything of your game ?
if you are going to play against her again in istanbul later this month , it 's going to be a different court , an indoor hard court . do you think you 'll try something different ?
i guess congratulations first .
first big final since indian wells 2010. how do you feel about that ?
you mentioned you had some success before . you won the title here in 2008. what do you think is the reason that you are the force to be reckoned with in beijing ? you must have some magic here . you always play great in beijing .
talk a little bit about how you 're going to prepare for either williams or radwanska who you 'll be playing tomorrow ?
you mentioned serena is the most difficult player to play against . i want to know , what makes serena the unique player to play , that she 's the most difficult player to play with ?
it 's the tenth anniversary of the china open . you are one of three wta players who have been here every single year . talk a little bit about that .
one more question : i found that you have very pretty dress for though court , and i love it . can you talk a little bit about your dress .
do you feel like 2013 is reborn year for you ? you 're now back on top ; almost certain to play the championships . we 're really excited to see you 're doing so good again and shining again . that must be really feel good for you right now .
talk a little bit about how you felt you played tonight .
you already have 70 victories , over 70 this season . how do you feel about the results you achieved this year ?
do you feel like it 's very challenging for you physically to play so many tournaments this year ?
talking about semis tomorrow , could be agnieszka or angelique kerber . talk about both of them , please .
we talked with your coach yesterday , and he said that he does n't do much coaching of you during the game , that you 're much more introspective and do your own coaching . would you agree with him ? and how do you feel about having him as your coach ?
speaking of maturity , do you have anything in mind , something like an ideal season before the start of the season ? what would be an ideal season for you ?
you had a really hardfought match tonight . you 've played a lot of threeset matches this season . what made the difference for you tonight ?
congratulations . you are in semifinal of china open . li na just said that you did better on the key points than she did , so that 's key of this whole match . do you agree with that ?
you have n't had this kind of success playing in the asian season before in your career . what do you think is the secret for this year ? you win tokyo and semifinal here in beijing . these are very good results .
i was told you and li na are very good friends . you train all the time . can i say that you benefit from the training before and that makes you know her tactics more than other players ? one more . what did you say after the game when you were at the net ?
do you think staying and playing at this level like tonight you 're going to be a serious contender in china open and also the championships ?
as you said , you played a lot of threesetters this season and you won most of them . do you think you are physically a better player than when you won wimbledon ?
all the spectators were cheering for li na . did you hear a group of them were cheering for you all the time ? did you expect that you have so many fans here in china ?
your back was against the wall down 54 , 40love in this first set . how were you able to battle back and claim the set ?
you 've had a lot of success against kirilenko in the past . this one seemed a little bit harder . what was different about today 's match ?
you seem to be doing some stretching in the first set , maybe holding onto your side . are you feeling okay today ?
with the debate of if the female players should play bestoffive set matches in the grand slams , venus was really supportive of the idea that you should do this . what 's your opinion ?

also , about your own performance today , seems like your movement is much better than it was in tokyo ; do you feel that way ?
when it comes down the end of the season , obviously the goal is to try to finish as high as possible . what 's the goal for you right now ? you want to do well in china open and the championships ?
have you ever thought of participating in doubles with your sister ?
congratulations .
in the first round you defeated the defending champion , victoria , and now you just came back to win svetlana . could you please talk about these two matches , and what is the key to your victory ?
i remember that you used to dance for celebration after the match . you did n't dance after beating victoria and today . will we see you dance next match ?
many chinese fans like to you dance , you know .
you start your year in indian wells with the ranking of 177 , and now you 're 43. because of the injury , you must have been through a lot . what kind of things you been through ?
you were runnerup here in 2011. this year you just defeated two grand slam champions . this court is a little bit different for you ?
just one more question . in the match with vika you called a medical timeout . how does your back or shoulder feel right now ?
we know that you get injured for a long time , so we want to know , have you try some new things that you have never tried during this time ?

first of all , congratulations for this tough match . this morning , juan carlos gave an interview . he said that in your homeland , before your fans , you have perform better . you know how to better control the situation . are you aware that when you 're playing at home you get used to the pressure and handle the pressure pretty easily ? do you agree with that ?
the match is over , the semifinal of asian championship is over , and guangzhou heng da has won . the official weibo announced the win ans also asked a question to li na . the question is , so li na , we won ; what do you think ?
last year in the third round of the china open , you played with peng shuai . you have 16 double faults . after one year , your performance has been tremendously improved . you have a tremendous improvement in serve and volley . the recent matches you have very good pressure to your opponent by approaching the net . what kind of practice will you do in the future in this regard ?
today , according to the statistics , you and sabine are very similar in terms of very important statistics . what do you think is the single most important reason you won the match today ? according to data . something can go wrong with the data .
you mentioned that in whatever situation you become very calm to handle the match . actually , i noticed that during the match when you do n't have a good performance or when you have ups and downs and emotions , carlos gives you some gestures . i 'm not sure if you 're aware of that . can you understand them ? can you tell us what they are ?
okay . previously carlos taught you how to stay calm . for example , he 's going to give you some messages . what kind of messages does he give to you ?
in the first set when you took the lead 65 , the spectators were cheering for you . was that helpful for your performance ?
your next opponent is kvitova . kvitova has played threeset matches in her past 20 matches according to the statistics . do you have any specific plan to fight against her ?
when you look back at the whole season , do you feel disappointed with the performance in the whole year ? you said you wanted to go back it top 10 , you want to be the top players . you seem to have failed the mission a couple times . what do you think about this ?
is there something you would like to work on during the offseason to get some improvement technically ? the forehand , the backhand , or even the serve ?
i understand the fans in china send you a very special gift . it was a portrait of yourself on a tshirt .
do you love the present they give you ?
good afternoon . there were a few moments in the match where it looked like you were going to really gain some momentum and go on a roll . every time that happened , it seemed like vinci took it back from you . anything in particular she did to make that happen ?
you met with your coach in each set . is that a normal process for you , or was that more because of who you were playing ?
although you lose the game today , you had a very good performance in the first set , and also especially you have really pressed her backhand . is that the strategy you got from your coach before the match ?
is it because of your physical energy ? especially in the third set your forehand has completely distorted in terms of the position , placement .
you have already been playing for four weeks . you lost this match today , which is something unfortunate . do you feel somewhat relieved ? at least you can have several days . after four weeks , what 's your single largest achievement and what is your next plan ?
do you feel somewhat relieved after such a long season ?
this year is tenth anniversary of china open . you have participated here many times , and also in 2009 you participated . also you have a very good play yesterday . what kind of meaning does it have to you when you participate in china open ?
you 've been doing very well recently in your past three tournaments . talk a little bit about that and what you think is causing your momentum .
first of all , yesterday when i interviewed zheng jie she believed that if you continue your performance like this one , you 're supposed to be pushed to top 30 in terms of ranking . are you confident in this expectation ?
your coach said that if you do n't give you pressure , then your professional career will end up with nothing . the result in the past two weeks means your future is coming ; is that right ? you did well at guangzhou . she said that she thinks that 's a very good start . what are your comments ?
last year when you participated in the press conference of the china open , you said that you were just a flower not yet to bloom . this year you have already very good momentum . also , you can lose the match quite easy last year . at quanzhou open , quite often you win the game 61 , 62 , so people have analogy that you were a flower that is blooming . do you agree with this ?
you mean that had everybody is rushing or pushing you to get more titles . for many years , did you push yourself to achieve those goals ? with such a wonderful performance , what 's your future goal ? you will participate in australian open next year .
actually , previously , after quanzhou open , you received the interview that the reason why you achieved this success is not because you are choose to be professional player by yourself , but li na said that the reason why the young teenagers do n't stand out is because they do n't have a professional attitude . what are maybe the corelations between your choice and the success you had so far ?
when you participate into singles , i noticed that you have injury that last for 20 seconds . seems that you 're not impacted by the injury . will you bother to make and explanation to that injury ?
what was your initial reaction to finding out you were playing another chinese player in the first round ? there are only four of you in the main draw .
what was your initial reaction to finding out you were playing another chinese player in the first round of the main draw , because there are only four chinese players ?
what is your single expectation for zhang shuai ?
i want to ask you to make comments on your performance in that match .
i have two parts of a question . in this match , what would be the single largest progress that she has made ? is it she 's playing faster and stable than before ?
you made a lot of progress recently as well . also you have a very good performance in wimbledon . if you can push to the wta finals for women 's doubles and li na is gon na push to the women 's single , that be a very ( indiscernible ) for chinese women 's tennis .
are you going to try to improve the physical conditions or you have some technical problems to address and you 're making progress towards this end ?
can you tell us about your injuries recently ? i was told that you have to go to germany to have some injections . is there any substantial progress made to your injury ?
is it an unexpected injury ?
did you feel that the new generation which is represented by zhang shuai has given you a lot of pressure ? do you feel this pressure ? what are those pressure ?
comprehensive pressure imposed by the new generation .
you know she is not that young as well , two or three years younger than you . for asian female players , is there any trend that only if they become a little bit older they would distinguish or stand out a little bit ?
you have a good performance in the women 's double for the season . what is your consideration of the relations between single and the double ? how are you going to try to develop which might be complementary to each other ?
obviously you got down big early , 51 , how were you able to make such a big turnaround so quickly in that match ?
pennetta is a player who has upset a lot of big names . obviously you knew that was a big challenge going in . mentally when you got down like that , did that go through your mind ?
this year seems you turn thinner and thinner . are you reducing your weight on purpose ?
you had 15 double faults tonight . what do you feel was the issue ? your serve was the story of the match , it seems like .
this is your second early exit in a row . you said coming into this tournament you were feeling a little better when you got here . do you think you had some carryover from the illness last week ?
i 'm so sorry about the loss . my question is : do you think it 's emotional thing ? because i was at the court with you , and from what i can tell , you were not very satisfied with all the mumblings . i 'm wondering , what do you say to yourself during the game and are you swearing or ...
what 's wrong with your service ? so many double faults .
petkovic looked a little injured late in the second set and was struggling . did that mentally take you off your game a little bit ? she looked really bad at some points .
unfortunately the result is not so good for you in the asian swing , but i think you still have something to gain in last couple weeks . can you just tell us about your experience in asian swing this season .
the result is not so good for you in asian swing , like tokyo and beijing , but maybe you can tell us something you still gained during last couple weeks .
do you feel the story from the night was more your play or something petkovic did it take you off your game ?
please tell us what kind of adjustment are you supposed to make for the preparation of the wta final ?
my question is : do you feel uncomfortable with the bad weather conditions here in beijing ?
in the second set you win 62 , and also the opponent called for medical timeout . at that time did you feel you were close to victory ?
before this tournament you were calling all your rena army on twitter to support and cheer for you . did you feel their passion and support today ?
i 'm curious , where did the name come from ?
i saw a little bit in the first set , and especially with her serve she was kind of moving the ball around a lot . how were you able to overcome that ? talk about those challenges .
about the goat debate , you always said you go by the numbers and steffi is still the greatest player of alltime . did you set this as a goal in your mind that you wanted to achieve someday , get to like 22 or 24 with margaret court ?
but steffi made a comment several days ago like she believes i can beat the record by margaret court with 24. the reason behind that is there is no competition from other players to play against you . so what is your thoughts on this ?
being no.1 and playing a lowerranked opponent , do you feel like you have a target on your back and do you take a different approach to that ?
hi , rena .
first , congratulations for the first win .
my question is : who do you think is the most terrifying and dangerous opponent in this china open ? i know li na has a lot of fans here , so who do you think ?
when you walked in you were staring at those pictures . do you like them ?
can you pick one as your favorite ?
thoughts on the match today , aga ?
and the 36 unforced errors , kind of a little high for you . part of that , voegele , she was really aggressive off your serve . how were you able to combat that and win those last two sets ?
seems that you 're not satisfied with your performance on the court . sometimes you 're even trying to throw off the racquet . can you comment on your performance to control your emotions or mood on the court today ?
talk about what happened out there today ?
first time playing in china . how do you feel about the stadium , the atmosphere , the culture ?
you always had great performances in grand slams . on the wta maybe not as good as grand slams . is there any difference the way you play in the different tournaments ?
it 's going to be a crucial time for the players to qualify for the yearend championships . you still have a chance . what do you think of your chances ?
also a potential matchup against serena . does it bother you when people always looking forward to see you play serena ?
talk a little bit more about today 's match . did you feel like you were in control of the match most of the time ?
congratulations . upanddown match , was n't it ?
you had to fight hard to stop her breaking you in the third , as well . what managed to turn it around in the end ?
you hit a few double faults tonight . what was going wrong with the serve ?
how did you finish so strongly ?
you must be very happy with how mentally you handled that third set , right ? is it more of a mental thing ?
2011 was obviously an amazing year for you , winning wimbledon , ending the year world no.2 . last year it was maybe a little bit harder , slipping in rankings slightly . do you see this potentially as being the spring board to sort of really challenging the elites ?
you played three very good movers in a row . obviously a tough draw . are you pleased with the fact that you can handle these kind of players ? how do you feel you are moving on the court ?
looking ahead , do you think wimbledon will be your best chance again as a slam this year ?
can you talk about the organization here , the tournament site , the setting ?
how did you communicate with your coach this week ? maybe he will have a longer vacation ?
do you think there is also top 3 or top 4 in women 's tennis like in men 's tennis ? and are you confident you can be part of it this season ?
do you think that 's a match that you could have won because you played brilliantly in the second set ?
tough start for you . how did you manage to turn it around ?
what made the difference in the third set ?
what positives can you take away from the whole week ?
what do you feel about the tournament overall , the surroundings , the court , the hotel , dubai ?
how difficult is it to play an opponent who is obviously so much taller than you ?
do you think the way she 's playing she says that she 's getting back to her previous form . from the other side of the net , do you feel her level is getting as high as ...
very tough conditions for you . your friend , obviously . how do you compare it to the last match in the us open ?
would you say you regret this tension that you had , that maybe you could n't play your best ?
when you were talking to your coach at 41 , then after you were playing more aggressive .
could you explain how difficult is it to go to the net against her ? because you did n't go to net like you did in the previous match .
still a pretty good week for you , right ?
do you feel like because you two did n't play doubles this week so you two can focus more on single now ?
you do n't feel like because you did n't play doubles your singles improve this week ?
there was an awful lot of break points , breaks of serve throughout the match . is that due to your style ? are you both better counterpunchers and returners , would you say , or ...
was that due to the uncomfortableness when you 're facing each other ?
i presume you wanted to go on and win from here . although you 're disappointed , you wanted to go on and win ?
on monday you 'll sit next to her again ?
would you go and have dinner with her now after the match ?
that must have felt good .
what do you think made the difference between you today ?
do you feel she stepped up a bit in the second set ?
you play errani in the final . can you look ahead .
you 're clearly playing very well at the moment , some of us think the best you have played for a year or so . if you agree with that , what do you think the reasons are ?
when you said `` well , '' did you have sickness as well as loss of fitness ? did you have health issues as well as a fitness issue ?
with your style of game , is confidence the most important thing ?
and when you 're playing well , do you feel you can beat anybody ?
last year , if i 'm not mistaken , perhaps your timing on your forehand was a bit off and it was n't as strong a shot as it is now . i mean , have you had to rediscover that shot in the past year or so since the wimbledon victory ?
you have beaten the past two dubai champions in the past two rounds . that must be a good sign ahead of tomorrow .
you said the other day you have changed your fitness program . are you feeling the benefits of that already ?
do you mind my asking what you meant by your body was confused ? it reacted badly to the training , or ...
how is playing in dubai different from playing any other city ?
anywhere you want to go specifically ?
how does it feel to be in the final ?
why do you think you won today ?
do you have an explanation for the fact that you handle it much better than her , these kind of circumstances ?
maybe your experience in the big stages ? final of a grand slam ? maybe you 're mentally much better in these conditions ?
this is the first time this year you and both roberta were both in a tournament and do n't play doubles . you are both in the semifinals singles . do you think about maybe we should play less doubles in the future ?
and you can also play beautiful backhand slice . do you think it 's one of the reasons you guys do so good not only in doubles now in singles because most of the girls do n't like dealing with that ?
i have seen your schedule . you 're going to play 14 weeks in a row .
14 .
no , you . you 're going to play 14. i have seen your schedule . it 's a lot .
you come from a country that plays tennis primarily on clay . you 're a french open finalist on clay . do you think going on from what rafa has been ...
do you agree with rafa nadal in that there are too many tournaments on hard court and not enough on clay ?
does your body feel more painful playing on hard court than it does on clay ?
you play either petra or caroline in the final . can you just talk about each matchup and how you 'd approach it .
have you thought what a final appearance here does for your world ranking or your confidence going forward ? li na is injured . angelique kerber is off form for the moment . how could it affect you in the world rankings ?
is there anything specific you feel you need to improve to try and win the final tomorrow ? anything in your game that you feel you want to work on ?
on the day when you play with your best friend , do you still have breakfast and dinner together ?
today , like today .
maybe talk about the match a little bit .
obviously the no.1 doubles player , are you able to bring something from the doubles to a match like this ?
you could possibly play sara next round . are you looking forward to that ?
a lot of players are very good singles players , and as they start to fade they play a lot more doubles . you 've kind of almost done it the other way around . you 're much more successful now with singles than you were in the first half of your career .
is it physically demanding , as well , demanding to play both ?
yeah .
did you both deliberately say that you did n't want to play doubles so you could go deep , you both could go deep in this tournament ?
in terms of your age i mean , you 're the oldest doubles player . serena just became the oldest no.1 . obviously you 're doing well late in your career , but not only that , but at 30 ...
how did you celebrate your 30th birthday ?
with the game with sam today , i think i saw a stat that you mixed up the slice and your flat shots pretty much straight down the middle . do you think on this surface that ...
you also seemed to take advantage of her backhand . she even said that you were able to focus on that and kept her your shots forced her to kind of use that weaker backhand .
you love your football , do n't you ?
did you watch the game last night ?
do you plan often ?
just an assessment of your performance overall ? how do you feel you played ?
do you think that petra is a favorite to win this tournament this year ? is she the favorite to win this tournament or somebody else ?
were you disappointed with the way you played tonight ?
you seemed to struggle against the kazak . if you look at this tournament at least what would you say was wrong you talked about the surfaces , but what about your game ? why were n't you able to kind of compete a little better than you 'd like ?
she had a lot of winners . the forehand seemed to be very effective for her .
you 're regarded as quite a tactical player . is it difficult to adapt your game to someone who is such a power hitter ? the rallies are quite short and you do n't really you know , you do n't have the time to find the rhythm and get , you know , work out a strategy against someone like that ?
what can you improve upon going forward ahead of , you know , the american stretch , heading into roland garros ? what do you want to get better at ?
can you compare kvitova to last year 's istanbul ?
that was a very good match from you . did you expect this kind of performance , very quick match ?
she said that the balls were flying . it was very fast conditions . do you share the same feeling ?
when you look at the game today , what would you say was effective ? you had a great forehand , 37 winners to like 6 for her . what was different ? was it the power of tennis ?
you seem , compared to yesterday when it got toward the end of the set , you closed it out much better and no doubts , no tiebreakers , things like this .
do you feel like the four break points you had in second set that was important ?
when you look at these last two weeks your play is very well , and if you compare , in terms of challenging the top two , especially with serena , you have been the one that challenged . do you sense that there are some big things in the future in terms of another grand slam , these kind of things for you the way you 're playing ?
what turned it around for you after the slow start this season ?
czech republic 's performance in fed cup and davis cup , was that the boost you needed , you know , that sort of vindication ?
yeah , but also your role in it , that you got , you know , the czech republic on the map almost in terms of tennis ? did that give you the vindication to perform like this ?
in the semifinal you will play against caroline wozniacki , probably same type of player as radwanska . same type of game plan for tomorrow ?
also , the unforced errors , though you won the first set , you really had a lot . is that something you will reduce significantly , or is that important when you 're hitting so many winners ?
to beat a top5 player , obviously you have been there yourself , but what does it mean in terms of your progress ? kind of a return to the top 5 or even higher ? to beat someone like radwanska , what does it mean ?
the surface , last year it was among the fastest on the tour , but this year they have repainted it , seems to be a bit slower and a bit more gritty . could it be faster ? how fast is it ?
how did you do it ? it 's just an amazing match . you just pulled it out in the end .
mentally it must be very difficult after you lose the second set 6love . you know , the feeling is the momentum is now in her corner . i mean , how did you claw back from that ?
how is the thigh ? it 's heavily strapped . i see nadia got treatment , as well .
you will probably be playing in the afternoon tomorrow against your doubles partner ?
how do you look forward to that ?
she said it would be difficult to play against you mentally because she regards you as `` her sister . '' how do you see it ? how do you see that ? will you find it difficult to play her ?
have you played each other before ?
when it 's like that , do you warm up with her in the morning , or do you prefer to separate for ...
presumably though if you were to lose you 'd be happy for roberta and vice versa , so it 's nice ?
you do n't stop talking to each other for the next ...
what are you like together as personalities ? what 's she like ? what are you like as a pairing ? what 's she like as a person , roberta ?
what 's roberta like as a person compared to you ? what 's she like as a personality , roberta ?
no . what 's roberta like as a person ? what 's she like ?
yes , how she is . what 's she like compared to you maybe or compared to other italian players ? what 's she like ?
can we call you the `` erravinci sisters '' for this week ?
looking ahead , how big is it for the both of you , you know , to be doubles players but to have got , you know , to the semifinals and potentially the final ? how big is it for the both of you to be here ?
it was a match with a lot of changes of momentum . what made the difference in the end , do you think ?
what have you got to do to win these type of matches ? because you were so close to winning tonight .
how is your fitness and your health now ? you looked like a bit like an advertisement for kinesio tape .
going forward , what is the coaching relationship with amlie ?
on the road ?
where will you do this preparation work ? at roland garros ?
who is ?
but you will be based at roland garros ?
from a coaching point of view , is it difficult when you 've had one voice , your father , for so long to change that ?
do you feel that 's necessary as well ? because an awful lot of the girls , with all due respect , younger , younger girls , vika , caroline tonight , do you think that 's important fitwise , improving fitness ?
when did you make this decision almost to redirect your career , make these changes ? did it come over a period of time or ...
well , you clearly have comeback , have n't you ?
you 're through to the quarterfinals with the loss of only five games , i think it is . that 's pretty good form heading in . must be pretty pleased with the tournament so far ?
it 's interesting , because the coaching thing , you appear to be absolutely cruising , 6love first set , no problems . but your dad still comes on .
the fifth time you played together . you have n't played each other for a few years . do you feel her level maybe drop a little bit compared to ...
last two weeks your tennis has been really good , as you said in doha and even last night . what are you most happy with about your game that is kind of , you know , really getting you back to the way you want to play ?
in terms of just your style of play , i mean , what makes your style is it pretty much has it changed a lot than maybe a year or two ago or it 's just a different way of thinking ?
why do you think that is ? i mean , why do you feel more calm not overdoing it and ...
when was it last year that you really felt offtrack , that you really were n't around what sort of tournaments ?
that extended through the french , wimbledon , and the olympics ?
just about everyone was ...
madrid , rome ?
serena next possibly . how do you approach that if that were to be the case in the quarterfinal ?
going on last night , you said you could improve slightly your serve and your return . it was like a 1 and 0 scoreline . is that the improvement you were looking for ?
if you do face serena , i mean , as you said , i mean , like the olympics when she 's playing , she 's such a dominant player . everyone probably must go out there and think , i 'm facing serena . how do you kind of put that to rest and just focus on your game ? must be a little harder with her than a lot of players ?
you beat her in miami 64 , 64 on hard court . that must give you confidence . what did you do better there against her which you felt you maybe had not done before ?
last year with injuries and stuff , obviously it sounds like that 's completely gone . the confidence is back even compared to last year here in dubai . seems you 've just got a lot more confidence in your game , and it 's showing .
can you explain what the injury is and when it occurred ?
what happens now ? how serious is it ? are you going to have to pull out of other tournaments ?
so you have some time ?
have you been having treatment here to try to get ready to play ?
i guess that 's your concern is that if you get out there and have a tough match you could aggravate it to the point where you 'd have to take time off or something like that ?
did vika 's withdrawal yesterday perhaps influence ...
this is the second time , third time that you have been confirmed for this tournament and it has n't happened ?
seemed like last week the back never came up , but was that bothering you as well in doha ?
because you injured it in australia ?
what kind of treatment will you be doing ? anything with more rehab ?
you 're confident by miami you 'll be ...
there are a lot of younger girls like vika , for example , are finding it difficult to keep up with the schedule . being the oldest world no.1 and being of a similar age to roger , do you think you need to be perhaps more selective going forward ?
she was tough to get on top of , was n't she ?
when you play someone that you 're not familiar with , do you try and work out how they play , or do you just want to continue playing your own game every match ?
did you watch the previous match , the match with robson , just to sort of get an idea about her ?
seems like one of the keys was you were able to convert your break points and she just was n't when it came down to it . was that experience , or what do you think it came down to ? she 's a young girl , 18 .
you were saying you liked her game . what are her prospects ? she just broke into the top 100. do you sense she 's someone that will move up the rankings this year ?
who do you think are the best of the players , age about 18 , 19 , 20 now ?
sloane stephens ?
keys ? madison keys ?
would she be the best of that generation , do you think ?
what does it feel like to be defending a title ?
there were a lot of service breaks in the first set . why did you struggle with serve today ?
did the rain break help you ?
yesterday wozniacki said the ball was flying . you find it 's different .
that was a highlevel match today . you start off pretty well and fall off . i saw the entire match . what happened then ? because you had more troubles for the serve , i think .
must be very good for confidence to get through these kind of tight sets like this .
she 's obviously trying to get back to her best level . she says that she 's getting closer and closer to that . how would you evaluate her level right now ? do you think she could be candidate for the top 8 end of the season the way she played tonight ?
serena in doha said that some of your shots on your forehand side were just unreturnable , and she said no one on the wta tour could return it . ana has just said the same . i mean , how much confidence does that give you that a ball comes on one wing on a fast court and you have the shot which seemingly no one else has ?
speaking of serena , i assume you 've caught up with the news that she 's withdrawn ?
serena . serena is out with a back injury . with that in mind and given the impeccable form you 're showing here in dubai , does that give you i guess a bit of extra confidence to think you can go all the way without the top two seeds here ?
speaking of the next match , it 's the defending champ , agnieszka . how does that shape up ?
just in terms of where your game is at at the moment , particularly the last two matches , you 're in impeccable form . can you put that into some form of context or perspective ? do you feel you have improved since doha ? how does it compare to maybe your best year when you won wimbledon or last year ? do you feel you 're at the top of your game , or is there still improvement to come ?
you mentioned the other day in your press conference that you 're feeling fitter probably than you ever have with your new fitness coach . do you still see that as being an advantage , like you 're running around the court a lot smoother and quicker and recovering quicker maybe ? would you say that 's a marked difference to previously ?
a question about barbora strycova , did you talk to her or do you know how she feels ?
you 're not friends of any kind ?
the start of the match was pretty tough . how did you get into the match ? it seemed like you could adjust very well , especially in the return of serve .
the first set you managed to get back into it . is it tougher on you to do a set like that after pushing like this ?
your coach , you called him at 41 in the first set . what did he say to you ? i felt like you were playing more on the backhand side because she tends to do more ...
do you feel you 're getting closer and closer ? seems like every week it 's just the margin , it 's getting better .
what 's next now ? indian wells and then miami , i guess ?
are you feeling physically well ? a lot of the players are pulling out . how are you feeling ? how is your shoulder ?
serena said last week in doha that some of petra 's shots , nobody on the wta tour could actually get them back , they 're just too good , too clean , too hard . how good of a ball striker is she , in your opinion ? how good a player is she when she 's hitting winners ?
do you feel , since you were across the net from her , do you feel her level was getting close to how it was when she won wimbledon , or is it tough for you to evaluate ?
what 's your verdict from the match ?
what was the key other than , you know , the mental approach of feeling that you had to step it up , what was the key to the game ?
you 're in the same half of the draw as vika who has pulled out today . is that an advantage , looking ahead , no.1 seed is no longer in contention ?
where do you think you lost the match , in the first set ? what went wrong in the overall match ?
how do you see your season from here on ?
what 's the next tournament for you ?
you 're playing very well at the moment . were you pleased to have got through that so quickly ?
i think a player of her quality with such a score suggests you 're playing either rather well or something unusual happened there . what do you think it was ?
in terms of your year , talk about you obviously have had a great start . you had a great match against williams and starting out so well here .
can you say what you changed with the fitness preparation ?
is it giving away too much to say what different muscles ?
you look a lot fitter . your match against serena was superb .
do you feel that you 're playing at a higher level now than for a year or so ?
what is it , in terms of last year i mean , you won wimbledon and there were a lot of expectations . last year you kind of fell off a little bit . what happened last year ? what was the difference ? now that you 're playing better , what are your expectations for this year ?
when you talk about pressure , you played where you have won a slam . where is the pressure ? surely doing well should take the pressure off of you .
there is a bit of talk going around that there is a rivalry building between serena and vika . do you subscribe to that ? do you consider those two maybe to be a rung or two above yourself and radwanska and a few of the others ?
would you say that the match against petrova last week could be a turning point ? because you were fighting a lot of breaks second set , and since then it seems like you have gained a lot of confidence . i feel there is slight difference .
you play ana ivanovic next .
doping is quite a prominent issue in sports at the moment , and i was just wondering , roger federer has come out and said more needs to be done . i was just wondering , in the wake of one of your fed cup teammates who has been given a suspension , unwittingly taking a stimulant , i was wondering if you had any thoughts on that ?
sorry you lost . how do you feel your comeback has been going from the operation ? you have had some good results , have n't you ?
no . i asked how the comeback has been .
what happened tonight ?
how long you have been away from the tour ? is your level of play where you would like it to be ?
the website said you did have surgery . what actually did you have ?
you feel all right now ?
how far do you think you are from your best ?
when you did so well in australia , do you regard this as any kind of a setback , this trip ?
you did so well in australia , very well . you have n't done quite so well on this trip now . do you see that in any way as a setback ?
serena williams said she thought it was weird that you have n't been given a wildcard . she said that you were a great player , and she suggested it was something that she would have expected . do you feel anything similar to that , or how do you feel about what she said ?
vika pulled out today . she said she played too many matches the last couple days . you saying you played 20 matches this season , do you feel it 's a little bit hard on your health , your body , your knee ?
vika .
just your reaction to the win , obviously beating last year 's finalist here . it must be very good for your confidence going forward ?
seemed like you won the backhand battle . it was a lot of backhand rallies during this match . was it something you were thinking about before the match ?
it seems like you 're becoming a more complete player as the years are going now . before you were very good on clay , and now you were finalist in paris . now you can play very good on hard court . did you expect that kind of evolution several years ago ?
i do n't know if you heard , but victoria azarenka has pulled out . she was in your section . do you feel that do you think about that , or is it too far ahead ?
can you talk about the match against sorana you have next and how you 're approaching it and what kind of game she has ?
just going back to vika , she said that she felt the injury , first of all , tuesday of last week in doha . you obviously played her , if i 'm not mistaken . did you sense she was injured or had a problem then ?
do you think it 's difficult , the two weeks of doha and dubai , the draws are small and the level is very , very high so you top players every day ? do you think it 's probably the toughest two weeks besides the grand slams ?
for years now we have had flavia pennetta , francesca schiavone , fed cup teammates of you . and now obviously you 're the highestranked female italian in the world rankings , and there is roberta , as well . how do you feel about that , being the highest ?
looking at your schedule , it seems you commit to play every week . is that a little bit tough for your body ?
flavia pennetta is playing bogota this week , is coming back . do you have a word about it ? do you keep in touch with her this week ?
she did rehab with rafa , we saw in some pictures in barcelona , i think . do you think that 's a good sign ?
maybe you could just talk about the match .
you were up obviously a set , and things seemed to really go wrong with the serve . you were really frustrated out there .
you were able to hang in there during the australian open , and in tough situations it seemed like as soon as she got the lead at the end of the second set it was tougher for you to stay into the match . do you feel the same , that mentally speaking it 's tougher for you ?
you have had such a great australian open . how easy is it to maintain that sort of high standard continuously ?
when you look at the last two weeks , what were some of the things was it your serve or when you look at the game last week compared to australia , what was wrong ? what was missing ? and also , was your health an issue ? because you had the abdominal ...
obviously there is a lot there is all this media expectation of the face of future tennis , a lot of expectations . does that kind of pressure , did that weigh on you coming out of it ? is that something that was i mean , is that reading too much into these losses ?
do you enjoy being the center of attention ?
do you think you 're going to be more comfortable in the coming tournaments , indian wells and miami ? your high ranking at 16 , congratulations by the way . do you think you will be more comfortable playing there ?
given that you , as you said , you could have gone back home to memphis and despite the results have n't gone your way the past couple of weeks , any regrets coming here , or is it a fact that you have more experience , different conditions , all that sort of stuff ?
on the subject of serena , we all know that she 's one of your idols . put her getting back into no.1 into context .
does it inspire you on an individual level ?
were you affected by the match against zakopalova ? because it was very tough conditions . you smashed your racquet after match point . today you seemed frustrated out there , as well . so were you affected in a way by the experience from last week ?
no bad vibes about coming to this tournament because of it ?
do you think you 'll have time to see a little bit of the city before you leave ?
must be very frustrating after the way you fought back in that third set .
you had some wonderful spells in the second set , and toward the end of that third set it looked like you 'd run away with it . how difficult is it to maintain that form to the finish ?
you 're not very well ? you 're coughing and you sound a bit ...
how difficult an opponent was she ?
will you analyze it , or will you just try and forget it as quickly as possible ?
will you be looking forward to some time at home now ?
with the chest infection , do you think you need to take just a few days off ?
so the chest infection was there all the way through the fed cup ?
how does it affect you on court ? do you have trouble breathing at all ?
just a word on dubai . obviously you had the problems with the luggage as well , and obviously you have n't played this tournament as much as you 'd really like . is it a tournament you 've liked and you 'd like to come back next year ?
how difficult was that to finish the match off ?
few problems with the serve today ?
we were wondering why you were playing when the shoulder is a problem at the moment with so many big tournaments coming up .
after last year , i mean , you rebuilt your ranking . you 're right up there near the top ranked . do you have a particular aim for this year , doing something big in the grand slams ?
i think you 've been reminded a few times this week that it 's a while since you won a title on red clay . now that you have , how does it feel ?
did you have any down during the second set , because now you have a break . it was a good battle . sometimes you have beaten her so easily .
last year blue clay . it 's because you 're used to charleston so you do n't care about the color ? it 's slippery , the court ?
how does it feel to have 50 titles in the bag , and how many more do you think you can win before you retire ?
just checking , what 's on your tshirt say ? bestest ever ?
what can you say about the start of the match ? did you have the feeling that maria just was n't really on the court ? it really looked like she had a shaky start . is that your reading ?
i suppose it 's all about continuing to relish the challenge of being out there and playing your best .
so how much are you relishing what you 're doing at the moment , and for how long do you think you can keep on relishing the challenge ?
you might have just answered this , but is victory even sweeter now than it was earlier in your career ?
do you still feel pressure ?
is there any greater or lesser satisfaction that the victory in the middle of the week you had that rather unusual set against medina garrigues the fact that you came through that and went on to win the title , does that make it sweeter ?
you might know that madrid is competing with tokyo and istanbul for the 2020 games . which city do you like in seven years ?
how much are you hoping to win the french open this year , and is it the ultimate challenge for you ?
i know it 's a kind of rome question , but you and venus may be ganging up on laura robson . i do n't know if you have seen the draw , but she plays venus in the first round and the winner will play you in the second round . you 've seen her play . what do you think of her as a young player and her progress in the game ?
congratulations for your whole week .
how would you evaluate your whole performance during the week compared to today ?
i was wondering , since you have had so many setbacks , i mean with your body and injuries and so on ...
which are those values that you get from your childhood that drive you to continue despite so many setbacks ?
talking about the match with serena , since 2004 you could n't beat her in . the second set it was there . do you still have faith you can beat her in paris , rome ?
you started the match very nervous , at least it was my impression . you made many double faults . can the fact that you could have got to the no.1 ranking beating serena have played a role ?
commiserations . obviously with your record against serena , how do you prepare mentally going forward so when you meet her again , which is more than likely , that you continue to have the belief that you can eventually beat her ?
why did you start slow ? were you nervous ? anything else ? because even when you won the fifth game , you won it with three double faults in that game . it struck me as a case of nerves . maybe not .
apart from tennis , we heard that the factory of sugarpova sweets is in murcia , so you 're also helping spanish economy .
congratulations . you did very pleasant match . i would like to speak with you about the serve . according to statistic , serena has 78 % of first serve ; you have 63 % . do you think that women 's tennis is becoming more powerful with serve like men 's tennis ? like good serve will be decided for the match ? women 's tennis change so much already .
that was serena 's 50th singles title of her career today . you 've been on the tour a long time as well . is she the best player you 've played against , would you say , or were there others that were perhaps better ?
congratulations for the match .
how happy are you for the match , your performance today ?
you tweeted today , guys , i 'm going to leave you because i have to prepare for my match . what 's is that for you ?
tomorrow you are going to have a very different player , either maria or ivanovic . what are you going to focus on tomorrow with your game especially ?
you 're into your first red clay final since 2002. is that a weird stat for you ?
also , ana and maria are going on now . do you pay attention to your opponents or do you not care ?
congratulations . my question is about the wta tour . you have been around a few years . i would like to know , do you feel that girls today have more power than ten years ago ?
somewhere in the future it 's not on your mind at the moment but are you going to play anything before wimbledon this year ?
also , i would like to know if you enjoy social network , twitter and facebook ?
what 's is most important for you , win tournament like madrid or to be no.1 ?
could you tell us a little bit about what advice your coach was giving you in the second set near the end of the game ? looked like he was getting quite excited .
( through translation . ) i wanted to ask you about your serve , because i see a good thing is that you 've got a good forehand , backhand . perhaps today in the second set we see that your second serve was not so good . it was a little bit difficult because serena was returning really well .
that was something of a battle today . difficult to know where to start . how would you describe it ?
to lose a set 6love is a very rare occurrence . can you perhaps explain why you felt that happened and what you did to turn it around ?
what do you think you need to work on more for the next match ?
after a match like this , do you use it as a reference of how not to play ?
the no.1 ranking is on the line this week . is that something you think about at all ?
do you go home this evening angry ? frustrated ? determined ? what 's the mindset when you come back tomorrow ?
there has been a lot of talk here in madrid about drugs cheats with two hundred bags of blood about to be destroyed . do you like to see drugs cheats ?
the cyclists , where there are 200 bags of blood .
do you like to see people who cheat by taking drugs exposed ?
it 's the 40th anniversary of this year for a lot of things .
almost . not far off . the formation of the wta , billie jean king 's battle of the sexes , equal prize money at the us open and all that sort of thing . when you reflect on the journey women 's tennis has made , what do you think ?
wellplayed today .
another solid performance . the scoreline suggested it was a fairly straightforward match . how do you feel you played today ?
you are moving much better , let 's say , every day in clay ? what 's your opinion of the court ? they are slippery like last year or better or how does it suit your game ?
the writing on the camera , i wonder what that was about ?
serious things about tennis : do you think it 's a good idea because madrid has a little altitude to go after to rome where you have also won ? so is it better for the schedule on the way to paris to play before in madrid and then rome ?
serious question : i 'm sure you 're sick of answering questions about how you 're good on clay , but when you were younger ...
when you were younger you came on the tour and played well on grass and were really good on grass and not as good on clay . now it 's kind of switched around : you 're great on clay and your grass results have n't been as great recently , aside from reaching the silver medal ?
going way back , can you remember when you first stepped on a clay court ?
about the 40year anniversary this year of the wta , and a lot of other anniversaries as well . battle of the sexes , for example , with billie jean king . when you think back to that time , can you imagine how hard that must have been for those ladies that set up the wta ?
at back of that , maria , what did you think when you saw that wimbledon were offering almost 40 million pounds in prize money this year ?
on a completely separate subject that has been mentioned today i never thought i would ask this kind of question .
i sent a tweet yesterday saying i thought signing of the cameras have become one of the most boring things in tennis . you 've taken it to a new level in the last couple days .
do you think about what you 're going to write the day before or the day off ? is it very spontaneous ?
last one on the beginning of the wta . billie jean king told us that day when they met in the hotel to form the wta , she sent betty stover , who was 6 ' 4 '' , to stand by the door and not let anybody out until they formed it . who would you put on the door now to stop everyone going out ? who would be security ?
not many people in the court , but the match against kerber was great . do you like madrid or are you recovering your game , does n't the matter where ?
your opinion of the courts ? last year they were problematic . they are very slippery or okay to move ?
maria is up next . in stuttgart you had a really tough match . what do you expect to do differently against her ?
are you staying in mallorca sometimes ? it 's not a secret , but you have a good relationship in general with spain .
congratulations . very good performance today . how do you see yourself , what you have done ?
your serve today , the placement was very good but pace was not serena 's pace as usual . it had to do with your back or something like that ?
your next rival will be anabel medina . she 's a spanish player . what kind of game do you expect ?
the sloane stephens thing died down pretty quickly . did she call you after your comments ? what happened ?
about the match , how do you rate your performance ? you lost four games . you 're a perfectionist , so how do you rate it ?
you said the other day that you played really well on clay leading up to the french open last year . you 're still unbeaten so far on clay this season . is there anything you took out of that experience you learned going into the french open ?
last up you were saying about taking pace off . is that hard to do naturally ?
recently you declared you thought only of winning your matches . now you enjoy it much more . what has changed from that time ?
of winning the matches , and now you enjoy much more . that 's what you declared before . what has changed from that moment ?
what qualities do you think you need to be really successful on a clay court ?
after last year with your pulmonary problems , how did you train your breathing to be better ? how did you achieve that ?
congratulations for the victory .
i was wondering , how hard for you playing one day at noon and the other one at midnight ? is there any special preparation for that ?
hi . very great match .
in the second set you get to 5all ; you were fighting a lot in that second set . went to a few deuces . nadal in the finals of montecarlo , he was saying that it was hard for him to play with the same intensity every point . sabine is a very strong player . how is it for you ? how hard is it for you to be playing with the same intensity in a match against her ?
very beginning of your career you used to struggle on clay , but you 've been improving a lot . how did you manage to do that ? would you say that now you 're comfortable on clay as on any other surface ?
first of all , congratulations . regarding what djokovic said , that he felt a bit attacked by the spanish audience , how do you feel here in spain ?
how excited are you about coming back to roland garros this year , and what is the first memory that comes into your mind from a last year ?
there were some surprise in the press room when you wrote the name of a wellknown spanish department store on the camera . is that one of your sponsors now ?
recently azarenka lost ; radwanska lost . do you pay attention to what 's going on around you or are you in a bubble ?
so in the second set again , you fought for that break and then you got to 23 and then you called thomas . after that it seemed you played more confident and picked it up . you guys are so close and you communicate well . how important is it to have him in this moment ?
each tournament presumably has a different feel and different aspects . what factors here in madrid do you think affect play , yourself and other players ?
each tournament has different features . what factors here in madrid , or unique features of the tournament , affect your play and other players ?
and the courts ?
that was a pretty tough loss . what would you say you 're most disappointed with ?
you came back from an injury . did you feel a lack of rhythm in the game ?
seemed to me today that it could be you were playing more than one opponent . seemed as though you were having an internal battle as well . you began incredibly well like you did your last match and looked like you were heading for total destruction of your opponent , and then it was almost as if you got involved with yourself and you were beating yourself up as well as the opponent . was that frustration or was that ...
the incident at the end of the first set , and then another one when it was 33 i think in the third set , were they significant factors in the defeat today ?
you said in the third set to the umpire something about she has a history . after all you 've done , how are you still in the game ? do you feel she should n't be umpiring ?
that was a tough second set . how do you feel that went for you ?
recently sloane stephens made some comments about you . i 'm not sure if you 're aware . if you are , what are your thoughts on them ?
your year last year was transformed in the immediate aftermath of roland garros , was n't it , when you made that decision ? you made those changes . when you step back on the clay now , were the memories coming back about that time ?
your results on clay have obviously not been as good as elsewhere . what do you put it on to ? obviously you won roland garros a while ago , so you 've had some success .
how was that match ? it was pretty crazy . you had your ankle and then you came back and almost lost the lead in the third set . sum it up , please .
how is your ankle ? do you know ?
so there has been a lot talk recently about your coaching situation . you 're with your father here . talk about your relationship with him and how he helps your tennis .
that was a tough match . how do you feel that went ?
do you feel it 's difficult to kind of compare ? you played indoors , in altitude , and in roland garros it 's obviously much slower .
one more thing : yesterday an interview was released and sloane stephens was trashtalking serena williams . i 'm sure you do n't care about that . is there any animosity between the lower players and the top players ? have you ever had any bad experiences in the locker room or wherever ?
you 've been coming to this tournament now for some time . madrid , as you know , is bidding for the 2020 olympics and likes to present this as a showcase to give an example of what it can do .
how do you see the tournament today as to when you first knew it ?
do you prefer a chinese or american for the next opponent ?
do you know her , mchale ?
that was a tough match . how was it ?
so what 's going through your head ? you 're up 52 and you lost i think four games in a row or something . what goes through your head ?
there was a moment there i went in to watch and it looked as if you were really heading for a really very forceful victory in the first set , and then suddenly it all seemed to go a bit wayward ; then there was a very tense sort of tiebreak . how did you feel at that point ? what were your impressions ?
there were a couple of moments when it looked as if you were really getting stuck in there , and then suddenly there would be a mishit . do you find that the conditions here are something you need to get used to , the altitude or the way the ball bounces ? because you were going into the shot , and then suddenly you saw it going somewhere else and there was a little scream from you , like , ah .
recently there has been a bit of controversy with sloane and serena . do n't know if you heard .
have you ever had any bad experiences around the locker room with players ?
with any players .
congratulations . are you happy with your performance today ?
how long have you been here in europe training for the clay court season ?
have you just had the opportunity to train here in madrid or have you been training somewhere else ?
can you compare the conditions of the clay courts ?
your opponent today , she 's pretty intense out there . you must know her well from the mouratoglou academy ?
how has it been , your preparation ? obviously your first clay court season with patrick . has your preparation differed ?
just seemed to be that she played incredible tennis today .
do you look back at that missed opportunity in game three to break her as the turning point ?
i think she was four for five on breakpoints . she converted on every one she got . what was going on for you in those games ?
at a tournament like this , two days before the us open , is it hard to maintain focus on a tournament like this when you know such a big tournament is coming up ?
do you feel you put pressure on yourself at all to defend this title ? was that important to you ?
what do you need to improve going into the us open ? what can you take from this ?
what did your coach tell you when he came down ? do you think it would have made a difference if he came down earlier ?
did she hit the ball particularly well or was she just getting it back in play all the time ?
she 's on an incredible run . can you assess her as an upandcoming player ? is she somebody who can be an elite player in this game ?
is there anything you think you can do to maintain your level , like the way you played yesterday versus today ? is there anything you 're looking to improve , or was it just not your day ?
seems like you were just never able to get into a rhythm . she took the match right from the getgo , never let you have a chance .
do you still have a lot of confidence after making this run to the semifinals going into next week ?
what is it about petra ? when she 's playing well , looks like she can beat anybody .
did you find the conditions difficult ? you caught the ball toss a few times .
you played her twice six years ago when she was just coming up . what 's changed about her game ?
do you play fed cup with her ? do you consider yourselves good friends ?
when is the first time you remember meeting on the court or in practice ?
when it gets to a point in the match , i think you won three points in the second set before your service game that you won , do you change your goals ? do you say , i want to win one game ?
you got a nice reaction from the crowd . was that a nice feeling for you ?
going into the open as a seeded player , is that special to you ? does that matter to you at all ?
you 're seeded 31 .
you 've never had a lot of luck at the us open . is it difficult conditions ? is it there something you do n't care for about the tournament ?
she hits the ball awfully hard and deep , does n't she ?
first match you 've lost here when you 've played a full match .
can you talk about the run , what it was like for you .
can you talk about your confidence level going into the open .
can you talk about how you tried to change it up a little bit in the second set , what you did differently .
talk about the misshit . floated right to you for an overhand .
she 's playing pretty well right now , is n't she ?
is that what it 's about for her ? she said she switched coaches this spring . the confidence comes . how do those things switch for a player like that ?
did you see any differences in her game from when you played her the last time ?
did it play as easy as it looked ? in a few minutes , it was all over . she was never able to get it together . she said it was more you than it was her .
what happened to all the threeset matches ?
she said when you play like this , you can beat anybody . did you kind of feel that way when you were out there ?
when people come into this tournament , they say that 's what they want to get , to be able to improve their game going into next week . seems like you 've done that this week .
when your dropshots are falling like they were today , is that a sign of your confidence ?
you 've never defended a title before . how important is that to be able to get that on your rsum ?
when you 're playing someone who is a good friend like that , is it hard to look up at the scoreboard and see 60 , 50 in 45 minutes ?
do you ever remember winning a match 6love , 6love ?
what about your potential two opponents , simona and caroline ? what about their games might give you trouble ?
you played caroline eight times . the cincy match was a close one . what was it about that one that let her win it ?
can you explain what happened after that first set . second set was 60 .
you were up 52 in the third set . she started coming back there .
first time they 've had a semifinal here with two czech players . how well do you know petra ?
do you think this will be watched very closely back home ?
back home in czech republic , do you think this match will be watched closely ?
third semifinal since you got married . is that the secret ?
when did you change your coach ?
what is the main difference with this coach ?
it 's been a few years , but you have had some success against petra . what are you going to have to do to be able to beat her ?
was there a difference emotionally playing in front of such a sparse crowd as opposed to playing on the stadium court ?
you 're supposed to play on stadium , then with the weather , how difficult is it to play with a couple rain delays ?
you played so well in the first set . when you broke her to go up 54 , what happened from that point ?
she broke you back .
yes .
in the second , it looked like you were down on yourself a little bit . was that about the first set ?
was that maybe something that surprised you in the second set , that she got to be a little more aggressive instead of waiting for you to make the mistake ?
what did you get out of this tournament going into the us open ?
did you notice her perfect smile again in the handshake ?
what is it that makes her so tough ?
she 's been a fan favorite here , only losing one match in six years . the fans seemed kind of divided out there tonight . did you get that impression and were you trying to win them over ?
earlier in the week you did n't have david here with you physically . is that a nice challenge for you , to have your hitting partner and be on your own in a sense ?
you started off slowly again today . did the rain have something to do with that ?
even though obviously everyone would love to win quickly and stay fresh , is it a good thing to have tournaments like this where you face some adversity ? is that good once in a while to have ?
you have played 29 threeset matches this year , which is the most of any top100 player . what do you think the reason for that is ?
when you get into a third set , you 've put in the work , do you like your chances of being able to win the match ?
seems like you were not able to get into a rhythm serving for a large part of the match . is that the way you were returning ? was it difficult to get your serve going ?
you struggled with your serve in the first set . are you able to , as you 're going along , figure out in your own mind what you might be doing wrong and correct that while you 're playing ?
it was 65. could have gone to a tiebreaker . how important was it to win without playing a tiebreaker ?
were you in the building when the fire alarm went off ? can you describe what happened in the players ' lounge .
they said it was somebody cooking food in there . do you know what was going on ?
you were n't the one causing the alarm ?
what is it like when you come back to a tournament that you have won ? does it have a different feel to it when you 've already won a tournament ?
you had such an easy first set , then the rain delay . how much did that affect your play in the second set ?
i counted 16 fans in the stands . is it different when you 're playing basically by yourself out there on the grandstand court than when you 're in a stadium full of people ? how does that affect play ?
can you talk a little bit about the tiebreaker . there were two mini breaks in there .
what do you like about your game right now ? what do you feel is coming easily ?
having all these matches on the same surface as the us open , how is that going to help you next week ?
will you stay and watch a little of the next match ?
what are your thoughts about those two players ?
the rain delay before the start of the matches , looked like you were playing fussball . what do you do during rain delays ?
overall impressions ? i mean , it seemed like a fairly good quality match for the fans and everything even though it did n't go your direction .
for the fans to watch .
to me ?
you had a lot of unforced errors .
48 .
i mean , in terms of the unforced errors , it seemed like you cut them way down in the second set , but then they kind of creeped back .
what was happening out there ?
taking all that out of the picture , was there something she did differently this time ? i mean , obviously you had a 111 and you won the last 9 prior .
did you feel though that the crowd was into it ? i know in the past , i know when you came here in 2009 , it was n't as well attended . they seemed very enthusiastic .
obviously sandy said there was obviously a onesided rivalry before , but do you sense a rivalry beginning ? it seemed like on court you were having really good rapport . is that something you would look forward to , having someone you could battle with all the time , win some , lose some ?
without taking anything away from a good match and a good performance by victoria , do you , to some extent , feel you did the main job that you came here to do , which was to ...
do you feel your physical condition improved as the week went on ?
obviously with vika winning today , it extends the battle for no.1 into next week . how does that feel , knowing that now you 're going to have to defend that no.1 in dubai ?
how does it feel to lift your second trophy here in doha ?
she saved the first match point at 52. tell us about the pressure you felt serving for the match at 53 .
what do you feel in this match you did differently than the last nine or ten against her ?
did it help i mean , she was obviously struggling early on with unforced errors and some double faults which you end up having , but how does that affect you when you see another player not probably playing at her best ? do you kind of try and take advantage of that , or do you justnot even notice it or what ?
did you at any stage think of the us open final ?
during the trophy presentation you guys seemed to be a good , sincerely a good rapport between the two of you , having a chat . is this a budding rivalry ? is this something that tennis fans can look forward to ? i mean , djokovic/murray ? are we seeing the beginning of something good here ?
what was that ?
what about the rivalry , moving ahead ? i mean , is this something i think she was saying that she kind of feels like you make her a better player . i mean , do you relish the chance in the coming months in the majors and stuff to come up against her in those big moments ?
you played a great game tonight . how did you leave the match ?
it seemed like it was clearly the best match you played all week .
now , you have a lopsided win/loss record against her but also azarenka . going into a match , does that help you or do you think about that ?
after all the tremendous achievements you have done for your tennis career , what keeps you motivated to this day to continue playing professional tennis ?
earlier , vika said that she hopes she 's not going to be playing when she 's 31 , which if i recall correctly , when you were a kid and most of the younger players , oh , i wo n't be here then . does it go by quicker than you anticipate ?
you have now 15 majors , i think . and the record is around 22. so is that a goal for you to break that record of majors ? i think steffi graf has it or martina has it .
obviously now that you 've got the no.1 ranking coming back , in some ways did having achieved that last night , did that take a little bit of pressure off you coming in today , and you just did n't have to think about that and just go out there and play ?
maybe you could talk about the match . i mean , you started really strong , but then serena 's serve seemed to really make it difficult .
just a followup , facing an opponent like that who you had lost to nine times in a row , does it become kind of like when you get on the court , is it a little bit of a mental thing , as well , that , okay , i have lost to her all these times , am i going to be able to beat her ? or if you just gain that one victory could kind of put all those losses to rest ? how do you look at it when you have an opponent where you have such a onesided record ?
after the first set , seems like you dropped . did you run out of your energy , or your face did n't look well . did you feel ill or did you feel any pain ?
you have had a long losing streak against williams . what are your thoughts on that ?
what do you take back from this week ?
is nicolas kiefer going to be part of your team ? can you tell us about if so and in what capacity ?
do you feel like anything in the game today , in today 's match , was lacking or like your serve or rally or anything like that ?
talk us through the match a little bit and just , you know , how it went and how you felt about it .
another final here . just talk to us about what are the reasons behind doing so well here .
the year is still young , but would you say this was one of your best matches of the season so far ?
who would you prefer to face tomorrow and why ?
i guess another way of asking that , as we talked in the preview , you have had your struggles recently against serena . what do you think it 's going to take to beat her tomorrow ? and is one of those things to cut down on the unforced errors ?
if it 's serena , would you say it 's exciting to have another chance at her ?
it 's getting very competitive at the top between the three of you , and obviously there is a ranking switch that 's going to happen next week but it can happen again . for you , is it exciting to have this kind of competition at the top , or would you just prefer to be dominant and way ahead ?
i guess a followup on that , obviously as of monday you will go back to no.2 . any thoughts on that ? is it frustration , or is it extra motivation now to get back to no.1 ? as you said well , maybe it 's just a repeat of what you just said .
last year here you faced radwanska i think in the semis or the final .
semis . in that match , you hurt your ankle and there were some words afterwards about she lost respect for you . have you guys kind of made up ? are you friends again ? you used to be friends .
just after serena reached a new milestone , can you just comment on how much she has meant to women 's tennis and just how her accomplishments have affected ...
like she became the on monday she 's going to be the oldest no.1 , oldest player to ever reach no.1 .
well , she does say she feels like she 's 22 .
congratulations . do you take pleasure in all the many people who wanted you to achieve that ?
of all the many factors that contributed to the win , was it just a sheer will to win the most important ?
over the past two years , how much of the time have you thought , i 'm not ever going to be able to do this again ?
during the week you were keeping your emotions in check , but obviously they rolled out today . talk about that . was that kind of thinking that you did n't want to get into talking too much about it and then just let it happen ?
during the match you seemed really emotional at some point . did that affect the way you played ? did you consciously know , i will be no.1 if i win this ? did that affect your play at all ?
nike just uploaded an ad of you saying age is just a number . i do n't know if you have seen that . is that really how you feel ? how do you feel , and how does your body feel on court right now ?
now that you are no.1 , there are a lot of people who basically felt you should have been no.1 at the year end because of all your achievements . did you feel that , or it did n't matter ? what was your thinking ?
tonight , it was n't your i mean , maybe you could talk about it . it did n't seem like it was your best tennis out there , but it seemed like when you needed it you were able to down 41 in the decider , i mean , you pulled it out . talk about your game and also what were the keys to winning tonight .
you have been on tour since 1995 , and now you 're the oldest player ever to get to no.1 . just talk to us about what is the key to how long you 're competing on tour .
when you said , `` i did n't expect this kind of reaction , '' did you mean yourself and your emotions today ? you did n't imagine it meant to you so much ?
you play tomorrow maria sharapova . will you play something different the way you played today while you play against her tomorrow ?
it seems to be very competitive at the top right now . is that extra motivation for you ? how important would it be for you to be at your top in dubai and try to keep that no.1 ranking ?
seems like it 's tough to gain some confidence back today . maybe you got into it a little bit late . can you elaborate ?
do you have any pain left in your foot ? are you 100 % now ?
you 're not afraid of the memory , like , oh , i 'm getting injured if i make this move , or ...
serena might come back to no.1 . in case of that happening , could you speak about it , the fact that she could be the oldest one for being no.1 ? what does it tell for you ?
i guess at this point in time we think of you having a slow start to the season . have you gotten to a point where that 's just how it is or it still bothers you or what ?
if i can , can i just ask you a little bit about your thoughts on ashleigh barty ?
i would like to talk about your dancing talents , about the gangnam style you have been doing with laura robson and eugenie bouchard . i would like to know how did she come to you for doing this stuff ?
could you imagine that it will be all over the internet ?
my last question is about your earrings . i have noticed that johanna larsson has the same . did you know that ?
i was wondering if there was some kind of gift that you won at one tournament or something ?
so you might ask her .
any comments on the oscar pistorius incident ?
was he a hero of sorts ? did you follow him at the olympics or even otherwise , given what he 's achieved ?
you must be pleased with that performance . how did it go for you ?
you got really animated after you managed to hold serve and saved all those break points with aces and stuff . do you feel the match would have gotten more her way if she had broken at that point ?
you still have , with this whole race for the top ranking , you have an outside chance if everything goes your way andyou 're still on pace . is that something , to get back to no.1 , would that be you know , a lot of you guys do n't seem to be thinking too much about it , but would it be important for you ?
you have been somebody who always likes to kind of have your private life , aside from this . do you think that your fans have any true sense of who the real maria is ?
your next opponent is either serena or petra . can you walk us through the matchups with both of them ?
if serena wins today she would become the oldest no.1 of the history of the rankings . can you talk a little bit about what would that mean , 31andsomething years of age ?
just wondering , when you were at the olympics , did you have any opportunity to meet or watch oscar pistorius ? were you surprised by the news yesterday ? i 'm sure you were , like everyone .
you played really , really well . does that somehow take the sting off losing a little bit ?
you said the difference was in the serve , but do you think in the second set that she played differently a little bit , as well ?
does this match give you some confidence moving forward in the season ?
last year you were in the same position than serena . you were one match away from the no.1 ranking . did you think about it before the match , okay , this time i 'm on the other side , i know how it feels for her , maybe i can take advantage of it ?
very close , anyway .
41. so you said the serve was the main factor for the fact she was coming back . is it the only factor you see ?
she seemed very emotional during the match . i do n't know if you could notice , but there was almost tears in her eyes during the match . do you notice these things when you 're playing her ? did you notice that ?
what do you think about her at 31 becoming no.1 ?
just looking at dubai , the surface there is a bit faster . do you think that favors you a bit and you 're looking forward to build on this week over there ?
the scoreline looks easy , but you definitely had to work a lot today against sara .
would you say that you keep improving during this tournament ?
just wondering if you have any thoughts on the oscar pistorius story .
unraveling ?
do you think that a lot of times people and fans or whatever do n't really know the people that they idolize ?
we saw a youtube video . any thoughts on it ?
are there four redfoos ?
it seemed like today you were moving really well and the net play was really spot on . what were you most happy with in terms of today 's match ?
you face either tomorrow wozniacki or radwanska . what approach would you take if you play either of them tomorrow ?
you like paris saintgermain . you have a french coach . i would like to know where is your learning french now ? can you speak some ? did you improve in the last couple of years ?
well , before we get to the match , let 's get to the important things : valentine 's day . did rory have valentine 's day under control ?
nothing else ?
okay . did you send him something ?
we ca n't watch two matches at once , unfortunately , but can you tell us from your point of view how the match went and how pleased you were ?
so what do you do ? hit the ball down the middle of the court more and use more spin ?
i think you were 35 down in the tiebreak , were n't you ? what happened and what did you do at that stage ?
you got on top in the second set ?
getting to the quarterfinals , do you start to feel some momentum is building when you do that ?
you played a good match tactically speaking , i think , because you played a lot of forehand return of serve . did you specifically prepare for playing the forehand return of serve on forehand ?
tonight was very windy , tough conditions . seems you adapted pretty well .
what do you think about her game ? it 's not the first time you have been playing her . did you see some improvement from her ?
you were cruising along in the second set and had a little bit of a hiccup . she broke twice . what was going on there ? was it again the windy conditions ? your serve was definitely better today .
do these type of conditions probably make it pretty hard to assess where you 're at at this point ?
if you reach the semis , obviously you become no.1 , and you 'd be the oldest player to reach that , the top ranking again . what does that mean to you ?
you said on twitter that you were single . how did you enjoy the valentine 's day today ?
something commercial you do n't really care about ?
that was a pretty amazing performance .
just talk about the match and just , you know , how you felt out there . you kind of talked a little bit about you said just dominance . seemed like everything was working .
apparently the conditions are tough but they did n't seem to bother you too much .
today is valentine 's day . did you celebrate it ? did you receive some gift ?
no text messages from anyone ?
who was that from ? anyone special you want to share with us ?
any electrodance musicians or ...
if you had one wish , which gift would you like to have for the valentine 's day ?
obviously you take one match at a time and are focused in a match , but in a performance like that , does that send a message to the other top seeds here that you 're here to defend this title ? i mean , is a double bagel like that sending a message to the other guys that i 'm not going to let this title go easily ?
when you come out of like last year , you came out of a win in melbourne , do you feel that just you 're on a wave , unstoppable ? is that the feeling after ? because you won here last year .
would you like to beat the streak that you had last year ? would that mean something to you ?
you saved about four set points in the tiebreak . do you feel that that kind of crushed her spirit or something ? because then it went really easy after that .
in a match like this where you did come back like that , what do you take away ? your game seems to be really on . you 're moving on the court well . what are you liking about the way you 're playing ?
it was tough in the first set partly because of the score pressure and also because of the wind . what did you tell yourself to do to turn that around ?
you were able to relax more in the second set having got through that first one ?
you had two very good years obviously in 2010 and 2011 . 2012 was not so good for you . can you say how you reviewed that year and what sort of plan that you made to look forward to this year ?
you always have this positive attitude towards your game , which is great . but you were in the point sometimes where you were winning so many titles back to back . what do you think is the key difference in your game now compared to the time when you were winning so many titles ?
your next is against mona barthel . can you just talk about her ? she 's having a few good weeks .
can you just talk to us about the match and how tough was it playing in the conditions like this ?
to be able to come back from 20 and adjust from the conditions , that must feel good .
i think you guys had a match in french open a couple of years ago when she won .
against romina .
i think so , yeah . i just read it before i came in here .
do you remember anything from that ? how different was it ?
i think you play christina mchale next . can you just tell us how you look ahead to that match and how you think of her game ?
i know you had part of your offseason here in doha ?
obviously you 're familiar with the city and you like coming here . can you just tell me about why you decided to come here in your offseason and what you think about it .
on court you were mentioning the word `` patience . '' i know this is a recurring theme . seems like you 're becoming increasingly patient . maybe two or three years ago you may have reacted differently , being down or the wind being so bad . what do you think ? do you kind of walk away from that experience , you kind of settle down and dominate ?
you have been playing pretty good today . do you think there is a specific sector of your game that you could improve drastically ?
yeah , from today .
i was wondering if you follow the other matches during the tournament ? do you get to watch , for example , serena , how she did , or maria ?
is it fair to say you 're a player that 's not particularly bothered by the wind ? you had good results in miami , and that 's probably one of the worst places for wind .
so we have been talking about music yesterday with some of the players . you 're the next one . we are talking about the british boys band one direction . serena says she 's too old for that .
yeah . but she likes justin bieber . i would like your opinion about it . about what you think about the british band ?
do you have a favorite member ?
i want to know that .
well done . were you pleased to get through that smoothly without any apparent difficulty ?
did you seek to play with economy and care and smoothly to avoid exacerbating any problems ?
so what 's your main feeling , relief , or what do you feel about it ?
so just to follow up on that with the ankle and the back , physically how did you feel ? how did it hold up ?
beyond the victory , just coming off feeling good must be an accomplishment or satisfactory ?
one thing that i noticed , the first serve you struggled with and seemed a little frustrated out there .
have you been able to watch some performances of the grammy awards ?
i see . we are discussing about the boys band , the british one , one direction . do you like this band ?
you 're not too old for justin ?
they 're about the same year old .
so has it sunk in that you 're a grand slam semifinalist ?
how did it feel out there ? i know you had the stomach injury , took you out of the fed cup last ...
how is the jet lag ?
you have been doing a lot of cool stuff , and you went on ellen , tweeting richard branson , stuff like that . how has it been for you since the australian open ? is it distracting at all , or are you enjoying it ? is it motivating you ?
when did you let mary joe know that you were n't able to come ? how long did you wait ?
so are you thinking of the playoff ? you hope to play that ? the fed cup playoff ?
just tell me how it is for you playing in this part of the world . there are a couple of tournaments here in the middle east . just talk to me about the atmosphere and whether you feel there is any difference on tour coming here .
so what could you gain now and think differently of where you can go , what you need to improve ? has any of that mindset changed after the australian ?
what are those goals ? i assume top 20 , which you have already done .
so it 's all about sam ?
he had a big davis cup win .
life is simple , is n't it , when it 's all about you and sam querrey ?
is there something going on we do n't know ?
healthwise , how is your health ?
talking about your game and everything , i mean , after australia , do you walk on the court a little bit differently ? i mean , do you kind of , after a victory like that , does it kind of carry over to this tournament where you come out with a different attitude , or do you think the players , oh , there she is , she 's beaten serena , so there is a bit of an intimidation factor there or no ?
that was a great game . how do you feel winning the first round that easily ?
were there any difficulties while playing ?
i was n't here for the previous presser , but i wonder if you know about the diamond trophy . is that any extra motivation at all ?
i remember you beat garcia in 2011 during the french open . do you feel that her game has changed ? has she improved ?
i know you have been asked this question a lot about how do you feel about coming back to doha , but i have seen your match and the crowd 's reaction . it 's no doubt you 're the crowd favorite . how do you feel today coming back after quite some time ?
did you see the results of the last grammy awards ?
no performances ?
if you have to decide what was your song of the year , what would it be ?
which song ? you can sing . can you try ?
it will be my last question about music , but i was discussing with laura robson about one direction , the british band . do you like this band ? and which member is your favorite ?
you have n't been here for a few years , but you have actually never ever lost a match here . are you aware of that when you step on the court ? does it play with your mentality at all , knowing you have n't lost here ?
the first set was tough . the second set you really turned it over . what motivated you ?
i understand you have made a change in your coach . your father i guess was your coach for a long time , and now you have brought in another coach . can you maybe explain a little more about that , the decision and how that 's affecting have you already picked up some things you 're applying on the court ?
when was that decision made ? was that a recent decision ?
i imagine that was a hard decision or a hard conversation to have .
are you planning to bring a different coach in , or are you going to continue to be like this for the time being ?
it looked like it went fairly easily out there . how did it feel ?
more broadly , now you 're top 10 and moving up . how does that feel coming back here ? qatar is a place obviously where you retained the no.1 ranking in 2010 with the wta championship .
who are you looking forward to playing against this tournament ?
that was your first match in the australian open . for you , was it encouraging or frustrating to be so close to beat svetlana at that point ?
i mean , your level of play was encouraging . that 's what i meant .
i see your dad 's back courtside with you coaching . i know this is something that came out i guess a couple weeks ago , but what was the thinking in going back to your dad , and how does it feel to have him back courtside ?
it looked like you were pretty much in control out there . maybe talk about the match .
you had to withdraw from the fed cup last weekend . how does your shoulder feel well ?
did you have time to watch some of the match ?
how are you feeling in terms of this whole beginning of the season ? because you have had rough patches in your career and great patches .
was it tough to see that fed cup result considering that you could n't be there ?
as a former no.1 , as you said , you 're getting up to that level again . how do you feel with a process of going against serena and sharapova this week and beating them ? what would it do for that process ?
do you feel you put yourself too much pressure on the big match like against radwanska at the australian open or in the previous big matches you played ? because it seems your level is there in the early rounds , but when you play the biggest ones it seems like you ca n't execute that game plan .
pretty good performance dropping only two games there . you just played a little bit better than last night . just talk about how you felt overall .
you got on top of her early , which i guess is somewhat important , got up 30 , and then she had a hard time pushing you at all , yes ?
what do you think of your level overall since you first got here till the end ? pleased ?
so the glass is always pretty much half empty every day ?
you showed a lot of respect to your partners on court . but it seemed to me personally that it was like slow motion between the plays , and then you played so easily all your matches here like two last matches that i said there were no opposite on the court . is just kindness to your partners in tennis , to the people that you meet in tennis , or is just how you feel ? because it seemed to me it was too easy , this tournament .
obviously you hide it . thank you very much . you hide like you 're tired or you 're nervous . i did n't see it . so thank you .
i think you have tied your career best with eight titles so far this season . do you feel like , especially at this point in your career , are you pleased with how you 've figured out your schedule , especially heading into the last slam ?
winning as much as you have on the biggest stages in the sport , when you see someone like sorana get as emotional as she did , losing a tournament like she did , does this put some of the smaller tournaments into perspective for you ?
sorana just said previously that she felt she played a lot better than what the score sheet said . how do you think she played today besides the 62 , 60 ?
what is it that you really want to improve still , going on ?
you mentioned all week how much fun you have had here and how you have had a lot of friends you have been visiting and so on . was one of the more famous ones in the stands today ?
just talk about some of the keys for you moving forward towards the us open to satisfy yourself .
so how do you avoid getting like butterflies in your stomach knowing that a big grand slam is coming ?
but the nerves rarely affect your play outside of maybe third set against lisicki , right ? you go out there and you 're nervous , but you can still play very well .
would you say this is the most dominate you 've been in your career against the rest of the field ? and how do you think you can sort of achieve this sort of consistency tournament to tournament ?
tough one even from the first game . she broke you , and then it seemed like you had a hard time just getting into the match .
so then the last couple matches you were able , against kvitova and li , you were able to get back into it . why were n't you able to get back into it today ? did she just play at such a high level that it was impossible ?
what makes her such a great player to you ?
you had a great crowd support out there today . have you been surprised by how many fans you have here ? do you think it helped you along this week ?
i think during the match darren came on , and he said that you turned everyone into believers this week . do you think you kind of turned yourself into a believer , too , knowing you can beat these top players ?
you got quite emotional at the end and during the speech . was it more like the size of the moment getting to you , or were you just upset with the result ?
the match tonight was much more competitive than the last two times you faced serena . what do you think you were able to do tonight to give her more trouble , and what do you think is still missing maybe to get that victory ?
is there anything you wished you tried differently to change that result ?
you were able to get her into some very long rallies , but in some of those long rallies she responded pretty well , no ?
so i would think , since you played her before , you sort of expected in the tiebreaker and at the end of the second set that she would show you her top level ?
did you notice how frustrated serena was getting with how low you kept the ball . a few times she kept going lower and lower and lower ?
your game is pretty complex . what would you improve for the next tournament ?
seemed like you shared a few words with serena at the net after the match when you shook hands . can you share what you guys said to one another ?
safe to say that you guys have a pretty friendly rivalry/competition between the two of you ?
today was a pretty close match . what do you think needs to happen for you to actually get the win , be able to close it out ?
would you say serena is the toughest player you have ever faced , and could you sort of talk about exactly why ?
she started off maybe a little off . she had that medical timeout . did you kind of expect her level to rise as the match went on , and do you think it affected you maybe in those break point chances ?
what sort of things are you saying to yourself when you 're playing serena comparing to the other players ?
what sort of things are you saying to yourself throughout the match when you 're playing serena , when you 're facing her , comparing to other players on the tour ?
yes , like just to help you stay in the match .
was this maybe the first time you thought within the match i can beat her , or was that similar feeling at wimbledon ?
talk about the match . you had some good moments in the second set . then at the end there especially in the tiebreaker it sort of got away from you .
so even in the tiebreaker you 're up 41 , and you commit two double faults there , but you still felt she was just playing at a little bit higher of a level ?
so today 's match was much different the way she was playing than australian open in january ?
why do you think you were n't able to play the same level today ? what happened ?
do you feel tired ? do you feel tired after ...
do you feel tired after the matches this week ? do you think you 're tired ?
after the first set your husband came out .
that seemed to up your game . what did he say to you ?
he did n't say carlos sent an email or anything ?
are you satisfied overall with your performance this week , given it was your first tournament in four weeks ?
do you feel like you have your rhythm now despite the loss , meaning are you feeling the ball the way you want to feel it ?
the other day you said you were a bit of a slow starter sometimes . today is only took you 21 minutes to win the first set . what felt like the difference today ?
you were down 41 in the second , and then at 43 you called for darren . he comes out again . somehow your level picked up . just talk about what he said .
can you talk about first two match points . you appeared to be nervous , or did you just strike the ball badly ?
so then just quickly on the tiebreak , i think you were 41 down there , too , and you came back . she had two double faults , but you played some good points there .
it 's been a few years since you were in a final . can you just talk about your approach with this new mentality facing highranked players .
obviously you do n't know who your opponent is at this point , but just try to get a feel for it . any sense of lack or worry going into that , or is it fullon confidence at this point ?
would you say that this is sort of the best tournament run of your career at this point ? what do you feel sort of really made the difference this week ?
any special boost of confidence after you fought off the two match points against caroline in the first round ?
quickly moving forward , just break down what you 'd have to do more or less against either radwanska or serena who are clearly different players .
i do n't know if you were aware of this , but yesterday following her quarterfinal win , li na was asked about the prospect of facing petra kvitova in the semifinal and not you . do you see that as a sign of disrespect ?
you have worked with darren a few times before . are you guys just doing what you usually do , or is there something special about this week ?
it looked like a solid victory . can you talk a little bit about the match .
the second set was much easier than the first . what did you change in your game ?
so by the second set you were more comfortable with her style ? you sort of knew more what to do ?
so this summer is sort of like last summer , no ? you started very well again . last summer you reached the final here , won cincinnati . now you 're back in the semifinals . is it hard courts ? is it here ? what 's going on there ?
is it the bounce of the ball ? is it the speed of hard courts ? is it how you move ?
except for someone who won roland garros .
can you just talk about , in case you play kvitova again , just your memories of last year 's final ?
do you mind playing lefthanded players , or does it matter to you ?
but do you feel like you have to adjust a little bit ?
going back to facing cibulkova , i do n't think you have ever lost to her in four meetings . she returns a lot of balls . what in your game makes it easier for you to face her ?
have you done anything offcourt in toronto , anything notable ?
how was the chinese food ?
last year you lost early in montreal with a love/love to karatantcheva . different experience this year ?
can you just talk about the course of the match ? you know , she did n't serve her best . just how you coped mentally and kind of the upanddown moments .
what did darren say to you when he came out in the second set ? i think you were up 41 , and you had some very loose games . you called him out and you seemed to settle down after that .
i know you have won titles before , but this has to be in some ways your best tournament . you beat two former no.1s and now a wimbledon champion .
petra said that you could always hit the ball hard , but one thing you did today which you did n't do maybe in the past is you showed her you could stay in the rallies , too .
how do you actually work on being more consistent ? what kind of things do you do ?
was there something that changed your mindset ?
you said yesterday that you 're also working on staying calm throughout the match . are there any specific kind of tactics you use to make sure you stay calm ?
you must be a little bit happy that she doublefaulted on six break points ?
you want to talk a little bit about li na , another former grand slam champion who you will be playing ?
you 're managing to surprise your opponent and turn the game around , surprise the public , surprise them . how do you do that ?
just assess your performance today . talk about the match in general and just playing her and what you think of her talent level .
other than you just being a better , more experienced player than her , what couple things do you think she 's missing ?
i just wanted to talk to you about the espn body issue . just wondering what the reaction is from other tour players , like john isner also appeared in it and serena and vera have appeared in the past . have you received any reaction ?
there was a toronto maple leaf player who also appeared in it , and he said his reason for doing it was to show all the hard work that he puts into his body , all the training he does . what was your reason for posing ?
what do you think about how a tennis player 's body differs from other athletes ? what would you say is maybe the biggest misconception , or what do you think stands out with a tennis player 's body ?
because of that , the comments or criticism that you received , was it hurtful in that regard ? it seemed like you went in with different intentions than they seemed to think you went in with .
john isner was in the issue , but if you had a choice of which tennis player , male tennis player , you would like to see ...
everyone ? two years ago when you were here you had things on your shoulder and everything like that . are you healthier now ?
you were n't in very good shape in the wimbledon semifinal . how long did it take you to get back to normal health ?
if you had been feeling normal , okay , in the semifinal , you might be the wimbledon champion ?
twoandahalf weeks in you played a number of matches . do you feel like your game is where you want it to be ? some sets have been good ; some not so good . talk about that .
ca n't always be easy to stay mentally fresh , but do you stay mentally fresh ? at stanford you seemed a bit mentally tired . do you feel mentally fresher now ?
you 're looking to play like threeandahalf hours against errani again ?
just talk about that match , because the two of you , you know if you both play well it 's going to be lots of long rallies , no ?
besides recovering physically , kind of the mental freshness , what did you do after wimbledon just to recuperate ? did you go on vacation or ...
the women 's game has become such a power game the last several years . i 'm just wondering how much time do you spend in the gym ?
are you one of those people that has to be dragged into the gym , or do you enjoy that part of it ?
just your thoughts on tomic and lopez playing exhibition during a wta premier level event .
do you think the women should be playing in montreal too , though ?
can you just talk about the match ? kind of up and down , coming back in the third .
so you turned the match in the second set . then she gets up 52 in the third set and you were n't quite playing your best then , but from then on it seemed like you really picked your level up .
seemed like it , no ? you felt like you played bad the whole third set ?
so you felt like she served for the match at 53 and you hit some good winners there . then to hold . and even in the tiebreak i think she only had one unforced error , so a lot of it was just , you know , your winners there , you hitting winners .
you 've played so many important matches in your life , but when you go into the tiebreaker , any nerves at all ?
which is a good thing , huh ?
you mentioned an email from carlos . it 's been a while since you have been with him , but can you just talk about the transition going from , you know , just having your husband around to a coach that 's pretty handson , it looks like . can you just talk about doing it at an older age , kind of how it has has it changed you mentally at all ?
your husband still practices with you ?
so when he says things to you in practice , does he say the same thing ? oh , i just talked to carlos on the phone , and he said you better play your forehand deeper down the line ? or you two just do n't talk ? you just hit balls ?
do you two , you and your husband , when you go to dinner , do you tell each other , no tennis talk at all , so it does n't become like a job ?
maybe the best you played on hard court since you came back ? pretty impressive overall ?
i guess against her the key is to make sure she does n't control the points , no ?
you 're facing sorana cirstea tomorrow . have you faced her before , and are you thinking how to go about the match ?
you were saying it 's important to stay in the rallies because you knew that sam was probably a little tired after carlsbad last week , but against cirstea , is that sort of the same thing where you want to make sure to extend her a little bit ?
were you surprised that she was able to beat wozniacki and jankovic back to back in a short period of time ?
extremely heated match out there . can i ask you about some of the exchanges , verbal exchanges , what they were involving ?
were there some verbal exchanges between the two of you during the match ? was that just heatofthemoment battles ?
very feisty player . is that a characteristic that the french players carry ? do they have a very feisty nature to you ?
extremely vocal on the court .
your competitor today , she was shouting , yelling , a lot of intensity .
when you try and stay focused throughout the match , what are the sort of things that you 're thinking about ?
when you call your coach on court , can you talk about that ? how does it boost you ?
you have had a big breakthrough the past year or so , 2012 , and you have credited that in part to a new racquet . how has that helped you ?
you mentioned power . a lot of the top players today are very tall . it 's a very poweroriented game . what are the ways , as a shorter player , that you need to play to compete with them ?
now that you have made a big jump in the rankings , do you have a particular goal in mind ?
can you just talk about the injury , when you felt it and what exactly it is .
could you only feel it when you were serving , or was it bothering you at other times ?
did they preliminarily diagnose it and say a pull , a little tear , or do you have to go get an mri or something like that ?
why would they think it 's exhaustion ? you have been up partying too late ?
so you have been feeling that the last few days or week ? could n't just be today , no ?
you had to wait for the trainer quite a long time . did you think you 'd have to retire ? did you make the decision after she saw you ?
can you talk about the first set before you really felt the injury ? it seemed she was dictating maybe a little more ? she was moving around a little bit ?
you have become kind of close to cornet , a little bit , alize ?
did she talk to you about what happened with errani today ?
errani thought that because she was saying `` vamos '' that it was sort of gamesmanship . and you know alize . do you think that that 's possible ?
this has happened on the men 's tour also , that certain guys get upset when someone is using native language . so if someone said like `` allez '' when you were on court and they were n't french , would that upset you or do you just say , i do n't care ?
unrelated to your injury today , your general style on court , you have a lot of movement , jumping around between points . can you just talk a bit about what that does for you physically , like why do you do it and what do you get out of it ?
seems like it would take sort of extra energy . do you have to do sort of additional training to get the fitness level so you can do that throughout a whole match ?
how do you feel since d.c. from the hot weather to much fairer weather here ?
you said in d.c. that you were struggling with your strokes , and here it looked well . is the difference the ball or you just feel better generally ?
just talk about the mentality against her . she 's a little bit up and down , has a lot of firepower . at times you were aggressive ; at times you were trying to play steady . talk about how the match progressed .
you played enough threesetters this year and last , so going into the third set what were you thinking ?
playing radwanska , talk about that . it 's an entirely different matchup .
so what 's the key against her ? she plays entirely different than a lot of players on the tour .
when you played her last year , were there times you were thinking she 's hitting way too many trick shots here ? too much offpace ? i wish she 'd just stop it ?
cast your mind ahead a few weeks and talk a little bit about how you prepare yourself for the media focus , for one thing , that is going to surround you at the us open as a comer that they have been waiting for for a long time since there are n't a whole lot of american men to pay much attention to .
do you like that kind of intense focus ? i mean , some people play better , work better when they can sort of be in a bubble as opposed to having to carry the burden of expectation .
what 's your reaction to the decision by the tournament operators to bring in the men who lost in the first round from montreal to play matches here ? it 's as if they think they need more entertainment value or something that they 're not getting out of the women . did you hear about that , that they were bringing them over ? as far as i know there are three .
you do n't know ? have n't heard about it ?
they are bringing over men who lost in the first round .
to play matches here .
does that suggest to you that they might not think there is enough of an entertainment value to the women ?
not to keep this subject going for too long , but what are your thoughts on firstround losers from this tournament have not been invited to play in montreal ? what are your thoughts on that ?
there is prize money , yes .
more .
invitational , yeah . they just made it up as they go along .
i can definitely understand your desire to sort of avoid making any statements about issues or creating controversy or anything , but do you think there are some issues like this one where not saying anything or saying it 's okay is in some ways worse and more controversial than actually speaking up ?
just assess your performance , your first match since wimbledon , how you felt , ball striking , all of that .
so after a while , after you got rid of the nerves , did you feel confident enough that you could go for your shots , hit your shots ?
so if you can compare your feeling of coming to net , say , from last year at this time , do you feel a lot more confident or is it still a process for you ?
the players always say that training in practice is different than matches , no ?
so talk about the different feelings there .
unrelated to on the court , there is a table tennis in the players lounge . is that something that you do play and do a lot of players on the tour play ? how fun is it ? how enjoyable is it , just as an aside , to get away from on the court ?
are the players good at the game ? who is the best ?
you make fun of your husband quite a bit . we were wondering if he ever gets you back or goes to a corner and cries ? what 's the reaction he usually has ? is there retaliation from him ?
on thursday and friday here there is a men 's invitational tournament as well as the women 's match with firstround losers from the montreal tournament . i 'm wondering what you think about that . is it good to have the men playing here , or does it detract from the women 's game ?
they start tomorrow . there is a couple men 's invitational exhibition matches .
here , tomorrow and friday .
you 're one of the older players on tour who ...
you are one of the players on tour who enjoyed success later in their career . i 'm just wondering with the wta 's program where they limited younger players from playing a lot of tournaments to prevent burnout , how that helped you and what do you think of the health of the wta tour compared to maybe in past years ?
how injured are you ? talk about what happened there .
was it your hip or groin ?
you looked pretty concerned though when you called the trainer .
so you have had it before something like this ?
but a pretty good fight overall , almost two hours , lots of long points ?
what did you think of your luck tonight ? the ball kept hitting the net and bouncing back about four times .
what do you think was the biggest struggle for you out of this match other than that leg injury ?
you have li na . i think you played her once in 2006. you retired , which is kind of incredible , given that you have both been around the top of the game for a long time , huh ?
yeah .
she 's kind of i would n't say a completely different matchup , but she has a lot of different weapons , moves well , coming into net a lot . talk about her a bit more .
i understand you must know that the guys are going to be playing here tomorrow night , the men players ?
lopez and tomic are playing an exhibition .
yes , first match on . your thoughts on having the atp players playing prominent centercourt matches while the women are still here .
none of you guys know about it . i do n't know why . yes .
exactly .
it 's an exhibition .
nobody . exactly .
i mean , is that seriously your thought ? if the guys are going to play exhibitions here , then maybe because it 's the firstround losers playing here .
were you impressed with how you played in terms of just fighting back from those break points even in the first and second sets ?
where do you rank this match compared to your matches against sharapova experiencewise ?
to be able to play under the lights on home soil , the evening match , what does that do , as well ?
what can you take away from your performance here this week ?
you seemed a bit frustrated in the second set . can you just talk a bit about what you were going through and how you were feeling ?
you have touched on this already a little bit , but can you elaborate on i guess the fan response to you being , you know , being the canadian hopeful here at this tournament in toronto and coming off that big run in wimbledon ?
the autograph session , as well , did you get some good comments ?
what did you learn about your game this week moving forward in terms of your play ?
you took some time off after wimbledon , and obviously this is your first match back . were you surprised how well you played today ?
you missed some time of course with the injury . how is the hamstring ?
what are you planning to do different in your next match ? how are you thinking to approach the next match ?
tomorrow and on friday they are doing some exhibition matches here with some of the firstround losers from the men 's tournament .
i 'm wondering , beyond pete sampras , what do you think of that idea bringing men here to the women 's tour ? is that a good thing , or does that detract from the women 's game ?
do you think women should also play then ?
you have n't been able to play that much this year . first match since roland garros . assess how you felt about everything out there .
physically are you 100 % ? seems like at times during the third you were n't maybe getting a push off your serve .
this tournament has n't obviously been that kind to you in the past . obviously there are circumstances this year and probably in the past , as well . how do you rate this going into the us open ? obviously you would have liked to have played more matches . how do you rate it overall ?
you seem pretty cheerful at the moment .
is it possible for you to have fun out there like at moments in the second set when you find you 're not playing well and you 're making errors ?
when you 're sort of in the process and coming back and doing all the work and getting in your first few matches , can you really sort of enjoy that part of it , or is that something you 're just trying to get through to get to better form ?
you said at roland garros that you did n't want to come back until you were healthy . i 'm assuming you 're healthy now . but if you have only been serving for a week , did you consider maybe waiting for another week just to see how you totally felt , or did you feel like if i 'm going do something at the us open i better get some matches in before i go there ?
so you 'll play cincy and possibly new haven before the us open ?
why not throw in some doubles just for match practice ?
you mentioned the doubles , and i asked serena this yesterday : is it a goal in 2016 to play doubles with serena in rio ?
it seemed like last year 's us open was really a great experience for you just in terms of the crowd support and everything like that . do you feel like that 's something that you are getting now at this stage of your career sort of where you play , sort of the extra support ? is that something that helps keep you going ?
is the red in your hair a canada thing ? did you sort of want to match the flag or something ?
welcome back to toronto . what do you intend to focus on during this tournament , something that you perhaps brought back from the previous matches ?
you 're by no means an older player , but for somebody who had success at such a young age , to find success again at 25 , what does that say about the tour and what does it say about your maturity ? we seem to be seeing a lot of that around the tour where a lot of older players are finding a lot more success now .
do you think the women 's game , because it 's such a power game now , that you almost need to be physically more mature to have success versus being a 19yearold and just not strong enough ?
do you adjust your fitness preparation according to the challenges you 're facing in your matches ?
have you had any time to , you know , explore toronto at all , or do you enjoy coming here ? talk about your experience here in the city .
with regards to the timing of the event where it 's placed between wimbledon and the open and some of the other players dropping out , can you talk a little bit about how that affects this event and maybe your preparation for it , trying to rest up your energy but also win this event ?
you obviously had some struggles years ago . i 'm just wondering how you 're feeling about your game these days and to be where you are in the rankings . are you pleased with that ?
you just mentioned you set up a new plan and some new goals . can you share any of them ?
how do you measure that ? how will you measure , you know , that ? are there any concrete things you 're looking for ?
just to get a couple comments on how you felt your match went . there 's a bit of a doubleedged sword here in that you 're eliminating a friend and a cocountry mate . how does it feel to be winning , yet essentially eliminating one of your friends ?
you 're playing some really good tennis this year . you 're really kind of on the cusp of breaking into that top 100. how important is it for you to not let up after this ? you 've got , i guess , jankovic .
congratulations on your career high , and i think you 're going to break into the top 100 also . jesse levine , you and he have become the first canadian jewish players to make the second round of the canadian open the same calendar year since 1969. how do you feel about that ?
i believe you were here when you were six . your father brought you here . can you talk about what it was like then and how things have changed being on the other side of the court ?
just as a followup , how do you prepare for your next match ?
i was just wondering if you could speak a little bit about what it 's like to play in front of a hometown crowd at rogers cup , whether in toronto this year or montreal .
obviously not the result you wanted , but do you take any solace from the fact that the person who beat you is canadian ?
that being said , do you support her ? i mean , she had very good , nice words to say about you . do you have a very close relationship with her ?
long struggle . you really had to hang in there .
just talk about what were some of the keys for you to be able to pull it out in the third set ?
it 's complicated against her . you were talking at stanford about playing aggressive and playing steady , not getting so crazy . seemed like today you almost found the balance ?
the match almost goes three hours , and it seemed in the third set you were getting stronger and that she was maybe fading a little bit . did you feel that a bit ?
which physical qualities priority is for you during this tournament ?
speed ? are you focusing on speed ? endurance ?
i guess the advantage , if there was one of losing early last week , was you got a little bit of time to rest and , you know , refocus and recharge for this week now ?
talk to me about the keys to the victory . she got off to a fairly quick start . you got back in the second and third set . what was important for you today ?
sometimes it 's not about playing well . it 's about the fight and the experience and all that , right ?
and she 's , like you were saying , she has a great forehand , moves pretty well .
when someone 's like that , sort of up and down , good and bad , is it hard to keep your concentration ?
because you do n't know ...
so how do you feel about your level since you have come back to play on hard courts over the last couple of weeks ?
against mattek ?
do you feel like you got enough of a mental break after wimbledon to sort of refresh yourself ?
so basically no vacation ?
but i 'm sure you want to play in palermo because obviously you 're from italy .
but it 's not so easy , given the big effort you put in the clay court season , roland garros , wimbledon , and then almost no break ?
mentally , that is n't a big battle if you 're playing every week ? because you play doubles too .
let me switch topics to fed cup final .
i assume you have been to sardinia ?
it 's a club ?
is that where you wanted to play ? you did n't want to play in rome or milan ?
it 's sort of warm there in november ? not so warm ?
and hoping sharapova does not play outside on clay ?
or would you rather just have her play because you want to beat the best players russia has ?
what would you say is the turning point in the match ? was it the second set after you broke her back after she broke you ?
how does it feel to stand alone now with six of these championships ?
you were n't very animated for a good portion of the match . you seemed really to be within yourself , almost like your mind was somewhere else . what was the state of your mind in that first set and a half ?
it was obviously not your best serving day . the conditions ? what was going on ? at one point your first serves were going at 85 miles per hour . that was n't typically you .
at the end of a day like this , after a match like this where you turn it around completely and win , do you get home and think , how on earth did i win this ?
if somebody pulled you aside at 24 in the second set and said , serena , you 're about to win 10 games in a row , what would you have thought ?
no , she was . you won the last 10 games in a row .
23 .
how much do you think the crowd energized you ? it 's a home crowd for you . they certainly seemed to get behind you .
you have talked about that you love to play maria . why is that ?
you consistently get yourself in very tight situations . us open last year against azarenka . seems as if , when your back is against the wall , you come around . how do you do that ?
did you get any advice from your dad today before the match ?
when you retire and everything obviously that 's a ways from now , but do you think that you have six titles here ; venus has three . do you think they might name the stadium after you or both like , you know , arthur ashe stadium and williams stadium ? that would be kind of cool , right ?
you mentioned you were really tired in the match and did n't have the energy . how did you bring your reserves back to get the energy and then just win the last set by such a huge margin ?
now you have broken more records and won another title . change to clay . what are your thoughts as you approach the clay season now starting with charleston where you dominated last year , then madrid where you dominated , and then the french open where it 's a little not so good .
how tough is it to adjust , you know , from one surface to the next ?
is clay your favorite surface ? what 's your favorite surface ?
maria was asked what her favorite surface would be to play you . she said grass . so i want to turn the question around . not just maria but any of the top women . what is your favorite surface ? if you could face any of the top women , what would you like to play on ?
like the mcdonald 's commercial with venus .
your thoughts on this whole big picture of this whole tournament for the last week and a half or however long , your thoughts on the tournament and how you did overall .
how much if anything does the record mean to you , sixth title ?
( question about the renovation . )
the french open is the only one of the majors of which you have one of . so do you feel like that 's the most challenging surface for you ? and in hiring mr.mouratoglou , was that playing in your mind in terms of winning another one ?
the third game in the first set was that really long one , and i think you had eight deuces . what was going through your mind then , like this is going to be a forever match ? what were you thinking ?
did you feel like you could take advantage of jelena because she got off the court so late last night and the turnaround was tough ? you jumped on her right away .
your serve i think 92 % of your firstserve points , 100 % in the second set you have to be happy about your serve .
jelena 's ball suits your game a little bit better than sara 's , right ? could you talk about the difference between the two and whether or not that was actually easier for you , as well .
are you feeling any pressure with the indian wells/miami double that people are starting to now talk about that has n't been done since 2005 with kim ?
i assume you know tommy haas pretty well .
he 's going to be 35 next week .
your impressions ?
i guess there 's always the specter of possibly playing serena in the final . you have n't beaten her in quite a long time . what do you think to do to maybe change that a bit ?
anything in your game that you are not happy with ?
yes , of course .
what do you feel about your chances in the final , taking into consideration that you have your ups and downs during this tournament ?
yeah .
could you talk a little bit about the fans here ? they 're very vocal . especially during the final they really scream and yell . do you like that ?
also , you talked about serena . can you talk a little bit about radwanska , what her game is like for you and , you know , what challenges you have meeting her ?
i know they 're not great memories , but what do you remember about that final that could maybe help you this year ?
they talk about the big four on the men 's side separated from the pack . do you feel like you , serena , and victoria are also maybe the big three and are starting to open up a gap between you and the rest of the field ?
you said something about tommy haas that just a couple months ago did n't even have a team together . over the years you have done such a job sort of like a lot of the guys did , novak , nadal , and federer , developing these people around you . people think of tennis as a solitary sport , and novak always talks about , even if he loses , i want to congratulate him and his team . now you 've got nicolas kiefer , a former top 5 guy .
that 's not where i 'm going at all . i 'm just so impressed by how professionally you go about this . i just wonder how often you think to make those kind of adjustments .
i think it says something that some more players are more coachable than others . obviously you get these strong people around you , and then you listen to them and you 're willing to ...
i remember when you won the french last year and you said you were going against ...
it 's interesting to watch . it is .
obviously pretty good tournament for you and on the comeback trail , but did maria just have too much firepower today ?
did you ask for a change of schedule ? do you think it was unfair scheduling and did you ask for a change ?
were the dramatic conditions from last night to today also a factor ?
given that situation , it almost seems a shame for the spectacle of the match for it to be influenced by scheduling like that . is this something that players can do to make the points to the authorities that this should n't happen ?
maria has been in four finals here and she 's lost them all . do you think that this could be her year ?
2004 .
what does maria do very well , or what is she doing exceptionally well right now at this phase of her career ?
do you still walk around thinking you can win a major ? at this stage of your career you got to the final at the open . do you still think , you know what , if things fall right , why the hell not ?
do you feel a gap between the top three , azarenka included , is widening to the next group ? almost like the men have the top four . do you feel that way on the women 's tour , as well ?
hi maria . congratulations .
i 'm thinking that ninth game in the second set was the key to the match . just talk about how it seems to define you as a tennis player , about going for winners on set point down , match point down .
three winners , too , on one of the set points .
what is it about you that you go for the lines no matter what the score is ?
how tough is it to play her ? she 's such a remarkable retriever .
what goes through your mind at those times ?
how does it feel when you get through a match like that , especially with your game because you 're so aggressive , take a lot of chances ?
the other night you paid respect to marcelo rios , and your former coach , michael joyce , told me you practiced with him when you were younger . if that happened , can you share that experience ?
what was the difference today in the match than your final at the french ? she obviously got a lot closer .
you often say a win is a win , but were you at all disappointed in your performance today ?
pretty well throughout the tournament and today i think it 's fair to say your serve let you down a little bit . was it because of the weather conditions or was there any other reason ?
are there any other great athletes that remind you of you ?
the clay is coming . how would you describe your relationship with clay at this point in your career ?
do you look forward to going back to roland garros ? such a different thing when you 're the defending champion .
it was such a high hurdle for you . do you think you 'll enjoy the actual tournament more than you have in the past ? how do you think it will be different ?
i 'd like to know how often you practice yoga and how you think it helps you in your tennis ?
you do n't practice anymore ?
how difficult is it to pull off the indian wellsmiami double ? last year you got to the finals in both , and obviously you could do it here . talk about the physical and the mental toughness of it .
how badly do you want to cross miami off your list ? seems like it 's one that escaped you over the years .
you mentioned earlier that she 's not as powerful as many players . was your timing on the ball challenged by the pace off her shots ? was it harder to get into a rhythm because of the pace of her balls ?
how do you feel ? watching the australian open it was very scary watching your ankle buckle . how does your ankle feel now ?
happy to have three wins ? compared to where you were ?
you always go for your shots .
how does serena make you have to go for them even more ?
but does she take away from your time because of her groundstrokes or pace or serve particularly ? does she force you more ?
what was the biggest difference in the second set ? you know , you were up 52 .
how excited are you about switching to clay , and especially getting back to paris ?
how did winning the french open change your life and your career , would you say ?
do you think serena is the better player coming from behind , sort of her hatred of losing ?
do you think that the switch to clay will be easier on your ankle coming back from that injury ? i know you 're feeling pretty decent with it .
will it be easier on your joints in general ?
what was your experience like in paris last year ? that was the first time you 'd come to a grand slam tournament as the defending champion . i 'm sure you were answering a lot of the same questions over and over . what was the experience like overall ? do you think it will be easier this year maybe with another year removed ?
you started well and then she kind of got back into it . can you talk about the match ?
are you able to take a positive from a match like this where you really were hanging tough against her and then maybe the match slipped away from you a little bit ? are you able to take the positives from that ?
you had the ace to go up 4015 with a chance to even that second set at 3all . did you feel that was a big momentum shifter when she was able to come back and break you ?
has it been harder for you in professional tennis since beating serena at the australian open ? you 're 19. you have just done the greatest thing you can possibly do . has the next step been harder than you thought it was going to be ?
what 's happening differently since australia in these matches ? you 've lost five of seven . what 's going on differently than what was happening at the australian that was working so well ?
but you want to win , obviously .
what did you do differently after dropping that first set ? did you have a different approach or did you just try and dig in ?
can we get your thoughts on sloane as an opponent ? what did you think of her game today ?
you 're going to be facing kirsten flipkens next . i guess you played her once before four years ago in fed cup . do you have any thoughts about playing her ?
there was that point in the second set where she had the ace and it looked like she was you were leading by a game . she had the opportunity to tie it . you were able to battle back from 4015. did you start to sense maybe there was a shift in the momentum there a little bit and that you were able to , you know , to kind of take control there and you beat her on that point ?
it was the second set when she had the ace that made it 4015 , and then you were able to rally back and take the point .
do you remember ? it was the sixth game of the second set .
when did it pop off ?
tougher to have to withdraw from this being it 's so close to home for you ?
when did you actually decide that you were n't going to play ?
you had a pretty tough match the previous round . was this any effect from that ?
what now ? what do you think will be your next event ?
do you have any worries that this could go beyond this tournament ?
what 's your thoughts on the upcoming fed cup ?
are you available ?
it 's convenient .
i wanted to ask who would have been your opponent today , sloane stephens . she 's been compared to your sister a lot . what do you think of those comparisons , if you have any thoughts of her going forward ?
disappointed that you did n't get to play venus and get that match out of your system today ?
did you go hit for a while this afternoon after it got called off , or what did you do ?
how did you find out ? were you getting ready to walk out ?
how does that affect your mindset ? you 're preparing your mindset for a match like that and then she pulls out .
what time exactly were you told ? it was a notbefore 4:30. what time were you told ?
probably tired of answering these questions , but you 're supposed to play venus today , and when you were in australia and you played serena there has been a lot of comparisons . is that sort of overblown how much you have looked up to them , or is that accurate ?
you may not want to answer this , but who would have won today ?
how do you feel your game is this week ? you had the big win in australia . did n't do as well as you wanted to in indian wells . do you feel your game is back together ?
as your career progresses , what is the key to being consistent , consistent through the ups and downs of tournaments all over the world ?
do you ever think back to last year when you were in the qualifying match here and ended your match and somebody heard it was your birthday and the crowd started serenading you with happy birthday ?
do you have to kind of concentrate , now that you 're becoming more known and there are are more media and outside requests , just kind of the balancing of staying sharp with the tennis , with the other stuff ?
how much of a support system is your mother ? how much what kind of impact does she have on you ?
venus is 32. could you see playing that much , that long ?
have you set any kind of goals in terms of your career longevity ?
is your life more difficult now than it was a year ago ? i know tenniswise it 's much better , but ...
are you primarily based in southern california or south florida now ?
how often do you think back to these days , to the courts in coral springs ?
when you got started , first started playing tennis . how often do you think back to how much fun it was back then without all these obligations ?
next person you face is the defending champion . any thoughts on that match ?
congratulations . that was very impressive .
tell us your reactions after winning .
how difficult was it to quickly get ready , or were you ready just knowing you might have a chance ?
this was the last hope , right , pretty much ?
have you ever gotten in like that before ?
is it kind of unbelievable now thinking about it , the way things work out ?
pretty remarkable match . so many ebbs and flows , twist and turns to it . what was your assessment of how things went ?
you both trained at the evert academy , right ?
how well do you know her ?
you guys actually played in a final in puerto rico in like 2010 , i think it was . what do you recall about that ?
what are the challenges of playing her ? she obviously hits very hard her serves and her returns .
when did you realize this thing is turning ? you know , all of a sudden she had i think people thought she had the match won and ...
yeah , in the tiebreaker . take us through that as you started coming back .
where are you from ?
how nervewracking was that tiebreaker ? you faced three match points and she had the double fault . crazy .
you said you watched azarenka practicing ?
what were you thinking ? could you tell ? looking for any signs ?
have you ever talked to her before ?
do you know who you play next ?
do you feel like anything now is just a bonus ? you have this opportunity and you made the most of it ?
you said your family was here . who exactly was here from your family today ?
so mom and friends ?
is this the best win of your career ?
what was it ? what do you think it was ?
have you been in this tournament before ?
i always ask everybody from around here , does it make it more special or make it easier ?
do you do any schooling in addition to this or no ?
where did you graduate from high school ?
11th grade ?
you finished 10th grade ?
obviously it was a tough first set , but were able to hang in there and fight back . take us through that . you were battling with your emotions out there . seemed like there were moments where you were struggling .
when did you start to feel like maybe things were shifting ? was there a moment , a point , or anything where you started to feel like , okay , i 'm finding my groove and finding my rhythm ?
does losing a set like that and then coming back , is that actually a good experience ? does that help in a way psychologically ?
can you talk about how it feels to have the whole stadium cheering for you ? does it feel like you have a home court advantage ?
would you consider sony open to be a fifth grand slam ?
which tournament would you like to win ? which one is your favorite to win ?
you 'll play the winner of venus and kimiko . can you talk about each of those people ? have you played venus before ?
what do you like the best about key biscayne ?
do you enjoy tennis life , staying in hotels , traveling ?
i know you started playing first when you were younger at plantation central park . it says you live now in coral springs ; is that correct ? it says residence , coral springs .
do you live in coral springs ?
it is . do you spend a lot of time there ?
you do .
so this is definitely home for you ?
you have talked a little bit in the past about the pressure and how your life has changed since the aussie . to be able to move forward in this tournament , what does that do for you and your confidence as you just continue with this new life and in the new spotlight that you 're in ?
how does it feel to be on tv and the ellen degeneres show ?
i saw your match earlier , and you obviously struggled really badly in the first set . what was it that you were able to get together after that and get going ?
who is here from your family watching today ?
mom ?
how old is your brother ?
so his spring break starts tomorrow ?
you were 1 of 12 on break points and your return is usually so reliable . what was she doing with her serve that made it that difficult to get the service breaks ?
did you feel a little flat after the whole week ? played semis yesterday and then quarters , and coming in here you looked for you a little bit slow . is the body completely there ?
( no microphone . )
can you be specific in terms what part of your arsenal that you did n't use on return of serve and your game in general ?
even outside of the return did you find yourself fighting yourself of the ground even today a little bit groundstrokewise ?
so fair to say then maybe you just need more matches given that you 've only played a couple in the last six weeks ?
when you talked to your coach , did he piss you off again ? you remember you said that yesterday .
i take it you 're playing in toronto . i should ask , are you playing in toronto ?
key to the victory , or keys , how about that ?
do those four games go by really fast ? seemed like , boom , you 're down 4love .
was it in your head at all that she had played so long yesterday that keeping her out there a while tonight would be to your advantage ?
for you , what 's the key against victoria ? to beat her tomorrow , what do you have to do well ?
sort of a balancing act with her . you want to be offensive , but you do n't want to get too crazy because she 's pretty consistent anyway ?
did you expect that razzano came out with so much firepower ?
what changed between the first and second set ? it 's like a different ana came out on the court ?
consistency was big in that match . you were on top of her at times but she kind of maintained a certain level and does n't miss that much .
must have been feeling pretty good going into the third set though , no ?
it 's not unusual for you , but during the match you 're riding a bit of an emotional roller coaster , no ?
you 've very positive , then you get frustrated , positive , frustrated ...
in english , translated in english , what 's the word that you often say to yourself after a great point ? you have the first pump and you wen in english .
and the language ?
talk about her level , because she just came back . she played well at times , and at times it looked like you were doing all the dictating . at times with her she can be more aggressive , but you were the one pretty much in charge a lot , no ?
so this is your first week without a head coach ?
so how did that go for you ? semifinals . you took her to three sets . not so bad .
so the fitness and the trainer , they 're not really following tennis ? you have to tell them when you 're winning games ?
was that the longest match you ever played , three and a half hours ?
talk about it mentally , the match point , the back and forth all the way . you had a crazy second serve at one point , too . do you remember ?
how much of your ranking falling to almost 200 was injury and how much was other things ?
this is your fourth tournament to go through and get into by a wildcard . you 've also done qualifying in two tournaments . at one time you were ranked 16th in the world and fell all the way to , i believe it was 196. how does it feel to be on the rise up and have the success you 've had this week ?
when you were struggling so much and the ranking goes down , did you ever considering quitting ?
( no microphone . )
in the third set you were serving at 53 and had the three match points . when those went away , what were you thinking at that point ?
how do you go from being so stressed , feeling all that stress , blowing the three match points and then a fourth match point , how did you get from there to over the top ?
( question regarding her parents . )
daycare .
right . and your father was a police officer ?
what i was getting at was that it does n't sound like you came from a privileged family , a wealthy family . sounds like you probably plugged away in your career . when you had tough times you kept plugging away . your background is seemingly very humble . growing up in that kind of environment , did they set the example to never quit , keep going , keep going ?
you talked about some of the heartache that you 've been through and what you 've gone through on the tennis court . in your bio it talks about you lost your fiancee i believe in 2011 or '12 . i 'm assuming that 's what you 're talking about . is that the type of thing you 're talking about ?
you talked about your tank being empty yesterday . you had enough to get over the finish line today by the end . how did you summon the last burst of energy ?
and patrick said that he felt the first game of the second set was probably the most crucial of the match . i just wondered if you felt the same thing ?
do you think you are mentally stronger than anybody else on the tour ?
do you think after today 's game we can say the tennis quality between you and the other players are closing up ?
82 matches this year . you won i think 15 tournaments total . playing that much , is that something you can keep up in the future , playing this many tournaments so consistently without long breaks ? how do you look back on this year and the whole scheduling ?
are you still not prepared to call this the best season of your career ?
what did you do to refuel last night ?
as we know , li na had a good year this year . what do you think of her ? what do you speak of her for today 's game ?
how do you like the idea of having an orchid named after you ? because that 's what they are thinking of doing next year for the championships in singapore .
having an orchid flower named after you .
and your thoughts of the championships moving out of istanbul to singapore ?
when you look back at the season , what are some of the things that stand out for you ?
do you , when you look back at your season , getting back in the car , lying in bed , do you tend to focus on the great wins or do those four losses kind of get at you ?
undefeated season next year is possible , then ?
you mentioned the grand slams that when doug asked you about was it your best season . is it kind of important that you had those moments where you want to do better next season to sort of keep you going ?
and the australian open obviously was one of those this year where you feel like maybe it could have gone better . i know you 're thinking about your final for the moment , but it 's not too far away , is it ?
you 're always regarded as one of the best players ever , so what do you think you can add to your game to make it even more perfect , i should say ?
how much are you looking forward to vacation ? you 've got two months ahead of you .
you will take at least a couple of weeks , i would think , before you get back into training , no ?
do you ever consider going to the snow rather than doing a beach thing ?
you did that once during the offseason ?
you did what ? tahoe or colorado or what ?
you skied ?
did you ski ?
right now obviously it 's the end of the season and tired and fatigued and things , but looking back , was it fun ? was the season fun ? was it a fun year of tennis for you ?
and you shattered the prize money record for women , breaking the $ 10 million mark up there along with like roger and rafa and novak . must be pretty good .
it was a pretty strong set and a half there , and then it looked like things maybe got away from you . so can you talk a little bit about the match ? where do you think it changed for you ?
carlos was saying he was very proud of your ability to serve and volley when you were down , that that was a development that he was very happy with . so talk about that , and how much mental energy did that maybe take from you , maybe having to focus on being courageous on those points ?
serena at the start has seemed to be quite a lot slower than sometimes , but then it picked up . did you feel like she really got into the match maybe in that second set ?
my question was similar to that . just during the match obviously you said you ran out of energy as the match went on , but did you also notice the change on serena , that she was increasing in energy maybe as the second set and third set went on ?
do you feel like you 're getting closer to serena , or do you feel like there 's still a large gap , you 're still far away from ...
after the time you now have worked with carlos , do you feel like he really understands you as a player and a person ?
yes . do you feel carlos understands you as a person and as a tennis player .
i know you want to think about your holiday now .
what you 've achieved this year , it must make you excited for what you can go and achieve for next year ?
it 's never fun obviously to lose a set 6love , but is that going to leave a bad taste in your mouth , or has this whole week been nothing but positive for you ?
next year the championships move to singapore . obviously there is a lot of chinese people there , and it 's the first time it will be in asia . does this event become even more important for you when it 's in singapore , do you think , for you personally ?
so what are your vacation plans ? do you know where you 're going ?
your vacation plans . do you know where you 're going ?
start of the second set , you lost all your challenges in oneandahalf game . so you got a little bit too excited , or it just coincidence ?
yes , challenges in two games .
why this happen ? just coincidence ?
looked like in the first set you might have been getting emotional there on the sidelines , and at times it looked like you were not moving very well and hitting your serve , and by the end of the match you were moving better . i guess we were all wondering what was going on . you did n't call the trainer . what was happening ?
physically you 're fine , you 're not sick , and you were just battling your own emotional , tired demons ?
what are you telling yourself to get out of that zone ?
were you dizzy or something ? your level , like your serve dropped speed like 30 , 35 % off your normal . there were balls that are normally easy to get to that you were n't going for . did you feel like taking a nap or something ?
you must have gotten some kind of second wind at the end of the third , though . seemed like you were moving better , speed went up on your groundstrokes and all of that . did you just snap out of it , or did you just have to say , serena , you 're going to lose , you 're going to be out of the championships , do anything you can to win this match ?
how much tennis do you have left for tomorrow ?
is this the first time something like this has happened to you ?
that gas tank will need to be very full , wo n't it , with li na awaiting in the final ?
definitely no problem with the backhand ? it 's very dangerous for us to make a diagnosis from afar . it looked as if you were really struggling to hit through on the serve in particular in the first and second sets .
a lot of the other players here have talked about how tough it is with vacation on the horizon and having one foot in the offseason and some rest . have you felt yourself drifting that way at all ?
at what point this season did you kind of stop and think , holy cow , i have played a lot of matches ?
before you saw that stat , did you feel all those matches physically , or was it almost like seeing a stat like that kind of started to play with your mind a little bit ?
you mentioned you enjoyed competition from other top players . it is fair to say you enjoyed playing with sharapova and azarenka , but do you feel you enjoy playing with li na ?
what is your motivation to play so much games in a year ? and my second question is : do you think the season is too long for all the players ?
you and li na are the most mature players here at the championships .
she 's going to be a career high no.3 . you had a great season , played more matches , won more tournaments . what does that say about sort of age and limits and all these kind of things ?
do you remember any particular thoughts that went through your head in the second set when you were the most tired ?
we had 116 million people watching li na in the french open back in 2011. can you imagine what 's the situation gon na be tomorrow night ?
you played this match in the afternoon . do you think that kind of affects your rhythm today ? because your last couple of matches you played in the night , and this was in the afternoon .
you have played both li na and serena , which i think a lot of people are guessing might be the final tomorrow . how would you judge each of their forms from what you saw on the other side of the net this week ?
is there anything that li na was able to do today in particular that surprised you how well she was able to execute certain shots or anything ?
how do you assess your season ? how do you feel about your season now that it 's come to a close ?
what do you expect out of yourself next year ?
i think over the course of the last couple of years you have kind of tended to get sick a lot . we saw you blowing your nose a lot at the changeover , as well . with the offseason coming up , is there any plan to kind of figure out why it is that you tend to get ill so often ? is it the travel , or ...
it has been a good end of season for you . can you bring that into next year , or do you start from scratch in 2014 ?
what are your plans for offseason ? any vacation ? are you going to the davis cup final ? any plans on that ?
do you think that li na might have a chance beating serena in the finals , assuming serena beats jankovic tonight ?
obviously sort of a strange match on your opponent 's side , level going up and down throughout the match . how did you adjust to it , react to it ? how do you think you dealt with that ?
is it difficult in matches like that when you come in with a game plan , a tactical game plan , and you realize that , yeah , she 's not serving as big , or maybe she 's not running as hard out wide in the first and second sets ? was it difficult to stick to your game plan and not want to adjust ?
how do you see the final matching up , and what do you think li na 's chances are against her ?
what are your feelings shortly after your last match about the season and how things have gone ? most people are pretty pleased .
your matches with serena are always pretty exciting and tense sometimes . i mean , you look back at rome 2010 , charleston earlier this year , and now this one where it seems like there is kind of other things going on on the court that can distract either her or you . getting back to your comments from before , do you think that there is something more to that , or why do you think that the matches turn out this way ?
serena was saying she felt like she just hit a wall in terms of ...
she hit a wall .
like physically just ran out of energy , an expression in english , or she ran out of gas .
not before today .
third set you are 51 down . at that point do you still have your game plan in your mind or you play by instinct ?
congratulations . how tough was it for you to play when your opponent did n't feel good ? how did it distract you so much ?
how many times did you expect her to retire , i guess , today ? because there were a few times where she sort of paused , and it looked like maybe she was about to . did you keep thinking it was about to stop ?
would you have retired in that situation ?
yeah .
how proud were you about the fact you were able to stay focused ? because during all of that , maybe in the past , you know , you may have gone off the rails a little bit . but today it was very focused .
my question is two qualifiers for semifinal are the two oldest players of the tournament against young players . what is the secret of this oldest player ?
you and serena . two oldest player .
going back to the australian open , you played her and a few injuries in that match , and now you guys played again .
and injuries in this match . maybe you two should never play again ?
your thoughts on your next match , which will be against the winner of this match now . kvitova and kerber , both lefties for you . what challenges will each of them present you ?
are you happy that you will not play serena in semifinal ?
are you happy that you will not play with serena in semifinal ?
better in the final ?
do you realize that if you win the next game you will be first make the top 3 world ranking first time ?
you have reached the quarterfinals or better at every nonclay event . does that surprise you ?
you have reached the quarterfinals or better at every tournament off clay . does that surprise you ?
the roundrobin format here is different from all the other tournaments . you seem to mentally have dealt with it obviously pretty well going 30 in your group . does that get easier with experience playing the round robin ? because it 's a little bit different than all the rest of the tournaments .
maybe it took a little time to get used to balancing those emotions ? this is your third time and your first time in the semifinals .
just experience ?
obviously a tough match , but it seemed like you are pretty comfortable in three sets as we know all year . did you feel the whole time like the third set is coming , it will be fine ?
you had 27 winners from your forehand , so i guess that was one of the keys to the victory , no ?
so net , i think you were what , 27 of 30 or something like that ? talk a little bit more about just your confidence level moving forward to the net .
what do you chalk up to , you know , your strong run of form after the us open ? you know , i think you 've lost one , two matches since the us open , so is it fitness , is it confidence ? seems like you 're hitting all your shots very well right now .
talking about the fitness work that you did , does that translate into better footwork for you or speed or strength or the ability to get through these backtoback threeset matches or things like that ? what are you seeing as the benefit of the work you do ?
so in the two weeks are you doing a lot of short sprints ? is that what he 's doing new with you rather than running long distances for speed ?
those are not too fun after a while , i would think , the sprints ? did he have you on the ground trying to breathe ?
you played li na a couple weeks ago in beijing , and you 'll face her again . talk about her qualities as a player .
now you 're in the semis . what can you take from what you did in 2011 ? obviously you have the memory of winning here .
talking about the tough match that you had with li na in beijing , your serve was too good , that match , for her to handle . do you think it 's gon na be the key point for you tomorrow still ?
i think you said at the beginning of the week that you thought the court was beginning to play faster with each day , so is it now substantially faster or just a little faster than your first match ?
but you feel that your balls are going through the court more now ?
seems like a lot of the players get along really well and respect li na a lot among the ones that are here . seems like everyone has nothing but good things to say about her . what 's your relationship with her over these two years ? do you have any stories about her or anything ?
what do you two talk about ?
first of all , congratulations , big fight . it was a close match but many ups and downs out there . what would you say made the difference in the end ?
you played very well after the us open this year , tokyo and linz and here as well . even though you only won one match , it was a lot of good tennis . do you think this sort of run can set you up well for australia in 2014 , or does the gap for two months make it harder to keep the momentum going ? what do you think ?
after a season like this , how long do you not touch a racquet ?
are you headed to the beach , hot weather , or do you just go home ? what are your typical vacation plans ?
is it hard not to pick up a racquet for that period of time or is it simple ?
athletes often say that once they get to a certain elite level that it 's harder to stay there . can you talk about that ? how do you feel ?
you 're kind of unique player because you can play really aggressive like yesterday . you can do much defense like tonight . but what is more nature for you ? is it attack or defense ?
that was a little bit my question , but what 's the next evolution of your game ?
and do you feel fresher mentally and physically now than you did a year ago ?
what are you going to remember most about your 2013 season , do you think ?
for next year , i guess , where do you set the bar for yourself ? is it sort of enough for you to stay sort of where you are , keep top 10 , or do you want something more ?
so can we expect to see you jumping in the pool today ?
is it difficult to motivate yourself when you already know you 're in the semifinals ?
what was the main motivation ? it 's points or just simply competition for you ?
obviously facing serena you 're going to want to be feeling 100 % . how do you think you 'll cope with that tomorrow ?
you have more wins against serena than i think any active player but i think venus , four . and the few matches have n't gone your way . what 's been the key to success for you in the past against serena that you will try to do tomorrow ?
other players have said that it 's hard not to think about the rest and the beaches that await after this week . is it the same for you ?
hiking up mountains ?
before this day , did you know what current situation in the group , what do you need for going to play , what will be good for you , what will be bad ?
did your situation in the group , what will you need to go in the semifinal , what will be good for you in the match , li , azarenka ?
so you get to finish this part of your season not only the fed cup part but the win in singles . not many players get to finish with a win .
you have made it here two years in a row now . a lot of players have said it 's harder to stay at the top than to get there for the first time . how difficult is it going to be to keep getting back here year after year ?
tomorrow you will start in doubles tournament . you will face with vesnina and makarova . you know these girls very well . what do you expect from this match ?
i know you talked at the us open about your confidence being lower and stuff . do these kind of wins , getting a win at a masters event and holding your own here , are you feeling better now than you were two months ago ?
tomorrow playing with roberta , do you think it will provide an extra motivation to you ?
can you just tell us what happened with the injury ? you 're clearly in a lot of discomfort .
it was clear you were in a lot of pain out there . looked like you were crying and you let out some yells . why play on , maybe risk another injury , when it was pretty clear it would be tough to win the match , anyways ?
so you really thought you 'd be criticized if you retired , even though it was very clear you were in pain ?
but at the beginning you said there would be a discussion about something when you listed the three reasons .
did the trainer assure you that you would not further injure yourself , or were they not clear enough with what the injury was to give you that assurance ?
during the last set and a half , there were several times it looked like you might stop . were there times you thought , okay , i 'm going to stop here , or whatever happens i 'm going to go to the end ?
just to clarify , it looked like at the end of the point before the serve that you might have felt something . maybe i 'm wrong on that . was it just after that serve and you landed that you locked up that you felt the pain for the first time ?
it 's been a very successful season in that you won the australian open at the start of the year . how do you reflect on the year now that it 's come to an end ? it must have been frustrating also the number of little injuries that you picked up along the way .
i was reading andre agassi 's book recently . he was talking about how a loss he had in a grand slam final to sampras wound up affecting him for months and months mentally . sort of has n't been the best few months for you since the us open final resultswise . do you think that match is still in your head at all ?
you and li na briefly talked after the match , and could you tell us what was the conversation about ?
talking about the injury , li na said earlier when she was here in the news conference the next time you 're going to play each other , she wishes both of you are healthy .
yeah . do you feel sorry that the last two meetings between you two went to a similar situation , like she had injury during the final of the australian open and you had injury this time ? it 's kind of a very unlucky situation .
you 're looking for the next meeting between you two ?
if you could just talk about a couple of things that were going through your head after your injury and you 're on court and you were emotional , but what were you thinking about ?
when you go out on court these days , do you even imagine you can lose ?
so that helps you maintain focus ? because your level basically all year except for a few matches have been pretty focused .
but when you come into here , eight of the best players in the world , sharapova aside , you know you 're going to be challenged and you go out there today and you know she 's dangerous , does it help you focus more ?
she had three chances in the first game . did you really kind of think this start , you wanted to get off to a good start and that could be really important ?
seems like with petra , in a lot of her matches because she hits so hard when she hits a clean , blazing winner up the line , a lot of players can get sort of rattled by it sometimes . you seemed to shake it off pretty well tonight especially . is that easy to do when there is a point that goes by that you could n't do anything about , to shake it off ?
what 's most pleasing to you about the way you 're playing right now ?
particularly good serving performance tonight , both aces and also what you were doing in the clutch . when you take on a player like petra , is that particularly just a tactic , like you walk out there knowing you have to serve big , or it was clicking tonight and you were just serving big ?
there was an announcement today that patrick was involved in about the use of stats , and there 's going to be more and more of it as years go by and coaches are going to have more information to deal with . are you actually someone who pays much attention to statistical evidence of your own game or the opposition ?
you 've got a day off tomorrow now . will you watch any of the matches , or what will you do ?
at what point do you start focusing before you get on the court , an hour , hour and a half , half hour , when you tell people , okay , i 've got to lock in , think about it , stop talking to me ?
boxers , before a fight , they sit down for 10 minutes and say , everyone get out of the room . i want to lock in . would you rather talk now and not get distracted ?
aga was in here talking about how when vacation starts for her in the offseason she will try not to think about tennis at all . is that something ...
radwanska . when she was in here earlier , she was saying she was not going to think about it for the next two weeks or try not to . can you do that at this point in your life , have an hour where you do n't think about tennis ?
do you have tennis dreams or nightmares , like vivid ones ?
and you get defaulted ?
the same one ?
australia ?
you 're just full of anxiety when you get up ?
matt 's not in the dream , is he ?
and she 's tired of it ?
so it 's all my fault ?
not your best night . were you a little bit tired ? i realize you played well , but that was n't your best performance all year .
azarenka was saying yesterday that she 's finding it difficult coming here , mentally that she feels tired and it 's hard for her to get motivated and to dig deeper . do you feel that way ?
is it also just hard psychologically playing in a round robin when you are 02 ? it 's not something you have to do a lot in tennis , where even if you win maybe you do n't have a great chance of moving on in the tournament . is this a different psychological experience for you tonight ?
a bit of a change in topic , but not a lot of male players talk about women 's tennis or women 's tennis players . but andy murray has always been a pretty vocal supporter of yours . i saw you guys going back and forth on twitter . i was just wondering what you thought about that . it must be kind of cool .
how do you deal with the loss in general ? you forget it quickly or look back and regret it a lot ?
how would you assess your year overall , 2013 , for you ? good , bad , middle ?
talking about tough losses , that wimbledon semifinal , is it safe to say that 's maybe the toughest loss of your career when you look back on it ?
are you relieved that you are at the end of the season , you can have a break ?
do you feel like a young player anymore , or do you feel like you have been playing forever , decades and decades ?
so when you go on vacation with your sister , can you really put tennis aside and not think about it for a long time , or does it come into your mind ?
what are your vacation plans ? what beaches will you be lying on ? any other exciting travel coming up that you have been looking forward to ?
who are the 17 , 18 , 19yearolds , 20yearolds who you think will make an impact next year or soon ?
sloane ?
are you just being nice to us ?
how does a tennis player unwind in the offseason ? can you be unhealthy and go crazy , or do you still have to remember you 're still an athlete ?
first threeset match anyone has played in the tournament . it seemed like a pretty good quality one . how are you feeling with your performance today ?
yeah , of the three days , first threeset match here .
has her comeback this year surprised you ? she 's back in the top 10 after getting a little bit lower than that . was that a surprise ?
in the third set it got very tight .
what was the difference , do you think , for you today to get the win ?
you talked about having one foot in the semifinals already . this is the only roundrobin tournament of the year for you , so what is it like mentally having won two matches already against very good players and still not being sure if it 's enough ?
you said you were n't surprised that jelena is back in the top 10 , but you played her not so long ago at the us open . she only got three games . do you feel like she 's playing better now than even a couple of months ago or a month ago ?
you ca n't say if her level is better now than it was then ? your level was better ?
you just tweeted that serena was just too good today . what was your assessment of that match ? were there things you could have done better to get it closer , or was she just going to steamroll anyway ?
is that just the biggest difference between you two , just that simple ? there were times when you hit plenty of big winners , a lot of power .
when you talk about improving your serve , what do you mean by that ? do you mean bigger ? do you mean percentage , placement ?
and then on the four break points that you did have , it looked like she just served a big ace and you had to walk to the other side of the court . so how demoralizing is that ?
when you 're playing pretty well but you lose pretty convincingly to a player like that , what do you tell yourself ? how do you come out of it ? do you say , wow , just , you know , she was too good and no big deal ? do you think , wow , i have a lot of improvement to do to get to where i want to be , no.1 or whatever ?
is it easy to forget about a loss and move on to the next match ?
is it all simpler , i guess , for you psychologically now that you are in sort of like in a normal tournament where if you win tomorrow , you keep going , and if you do n't , you lose , and it will be that way the rest of the way here ?
if you can beat serena eventually one day , do you think the indoor hard court is the favorite court you can do this , to beat serena ?
seems like you did everything well in the match . how did it feel ?
did you feel physical advantage because she played third match in a row and you played only second match ?
tomorrow you have a match with petra . what do you think about that ?
you got a lot closer than you did in newyork . is that some consolation ?
obviously it 's a bit of a unique format to this tournament here where you can lose today but still , you know , obviously you still have a good chance of making semifinals . how do you sort of prepare for the sort of unique situation that way ? is it all different for you psychologically coming back the day after a loss to play ?
( through translation . ) even though you lost this match , you looked in form and your two matches have been the most exciting matches of the tournament so far . do you have a special preparation in order to have these exciting and enduring matches ?
sounds like you 're still having fun out there . you keep saying you want to finish the year strong . can finishing the year strong give you a momentum going into the next year even though it 's only october ?
i notice you tried to put a lot of balls into li na 's backhand . it is fair to say that li na has one of the best backhands in the tour . so do you think it 's effective strategy to do ...
i think you do or ...
my question is : do you think it 's effective strategy maybe for you or for other players to try to move her out of pace ?
this is your first time in turkey . how does the atmosphere here compare to doha to you ?
looked like it was a pretty good match from radwanska tonight , but you were able to get through . were you happy with your level of play and how you were out there ?
what in particular were you less than happy with ?
how do you keep motivated against someone you have beaten seven times coming into this match and eight tonight ?
azarenka was saying that she 's mentally tired , end of the year , she 's had to kind of push through things . have you been at that stage in your career at the end of the year , it 's tough to get motivated ?
how do you keep your mind on the matches , then ?
so does that help or hurt , knowing that , you know , it 's the last of a push and you can push it to the limit here because you 're going to get a break , or are you sort of thinking , wow , that break is tantalizingly close , and it 's hard to keep it together ?
a lot of selfexhortations there at the end of that second set . you still look like you 're pretty hungry and pretty motivated .
talk about the schedule and how tough it is to stay focused now . next week is the fed cup final , which a lot of players from the russian side decided they do n't want to play , they are too tired this time of year or something . do you think the schedule , in regards to that , should be changed to make that a more accessible event for players ? i know you 're obviously not playing this year .
russia and italy .
is it something where fed cup is an issue the players council has talked about ?
i guess all this begs the question , do you like the more compact schedule now when you guys are ending october 20something , or would you rather have a little bit more of a break after the us open and push the season back into november ?
just a quick question about tomorrow 's match against petra . it 's kind of a highly anticipated one between the both of you . when you go into a match against a player who hits as big as she does , mentally is there an adjustment that needs to be made , or are you still just , like , i 'll just play my game and i 'm good ?
it looked like a good match from you tonight . that was what it looked like from where we were sitting . how did you feel about tonight 's performance ?
a couple players have been in here today talking about how it 's difficult to stay motivated during this tournament even though it 's one of the biggest ones of the season . you know , you 're only a few days from vacation and the end of it . mentally how are you at this tournament this year ?
we were talking yesterday about you 're thinking about what works against serena and what does n't . so what were the things that i guess did work today against her when you did have success , and what are the things that just did not work ?
yeah .
have you ever tried to share your thoughts with other players in the locker room how you can actually beat serena ?
what do you think you 'll feel when you do beat her some day ? what do you think it will feel like when you do beat her some day ?
do you think it 's going to be a very worse situation for the women 's tennis if all the other top five players lost serena at least for ten times , including you and li na maybe ?
do you feel like it 's the very worst situation to women 's tennis that maybe the other top five players , other than victoria and maria sharapova , you and li na all lost to serena at least ten times ?
looking forward to not tomorrow 's match but vacation time , do you typically go to like a beachy hot area , or do you go home ? what are you looking forward to ?
are you going on vacation with your sister or your friends or ...
after the last match it was guaranteed that in the end of the year you will be higher than maria sharapova 's ranking . does it mean something for you ?
li na still can be higher than you . so it 's not yet .
you were down 31 in the second set and 20 in the tiebreaker , but you were able to come out on top and finally win again . is the second set kind of the evidence of , would you say , better control of yourself ?
were you happy with how you played in the end ? were you happy with your performance tonight ?
it seems like you were attacking , though , consistently . you know she 's going to bring a lot of balls back . talk about there is sort of a line between attacking but not being too crazy with how you play her .
so you 're up 53 , you had a match point there , you missed a forehand and then you were serving for the match . she had a bunch of breakpoints , you got some back , and you got broken again . was that nerves there for a while ?
you said before i think in another profile piece , new york times , that you get down on yourself historically . sometimes something goes wrong in the match , and you start to get negative and that carlos has helped you a lot with that . what do you tell yourself in a situation like that where you had a match point and you missed it ? how are you staying positive nowadays ?
this is only your first match here , and then you 'll have a bunch in a row , but do you like the compact format here or do you think it will be better next year with more days and rest in between and eight doubles teams ?
let 's hope not . but do you mind the rhythm of mostly playing every day ? is that a good rhythm ? or you prefer days off in between ?
speaking of schedule , do you think that this time the schedule is a little tight for you because you get a rest for yesterday but you probably have to play two , three , or four or five days in a row ?
do you think it 's unfair on your side because of three years in a row you played three days ...
the championships are a very difficult type of tournament and very different , right , the round robin and everything ? what 's the most difficult thing about playing this tournament now that you 've played it multiple times ?
is it mostly the mental aspect is the most difficult aspect for you of playing the yearends ?
you have been working on your net game all year , a little serve and volley , coming in , but it still does n't seem like you 're totally comfortable there . does it feel like home , or does it feel like you went to a hotel and your key did n't work and you 're foreign to the place ?
when you took your time off and you were a journalism student , do you remember any stories , what you wrote about ?
like ? politics ? economics ?
so did you find it boring or did you find it too hard and that 's why you came back to the tour ?
you mentioned your vacation coming up . what are your vacation plans ?
big ? small ?
your plans . like is it sort of a big adventure or just something small and quiet ?
it 's his decision where you go ?
going back to the serving and volleying , your prior coaches , did they try and get you to go to the net more , or is it just because carlos and his reputation as a coach , now that he 's telling you , now you buy into it ? it seems like you 're very committed to changing your game now . so why not before ?
as a former journalist student , you now travel the world and you see the world 's journalism . do you read the newspapers wherever you go ? do you see the difference in the newspapers wherever you go ?
in chinese ?
and now you get your news from the internet , do you , in chinese ? when you want to read about things other than what 's going on on the tennis tour , you read on the internet ?
that 's what i said . you read a chinese site on the internet ?
keeping on the journalism theme , did you ever write about sports when you were a journalism student ?
you did ?
which sports ?
any sport ?
tennis ?
when you finish playing tennis , do you have any desire to return to journalism ? would you like to be a journalist after your tennis career ?
pretty clean match from you . you seemed to control it very well . you were opportunistic . the whole time she was a little bit off , but it seemed like it was in your hands most of the time .
when you lose four times in a row ...
in a row , coming into this match .
few times after that .
obviously they were n't weighing on your mind ?
you actually seemed as though you were having a wonderful time out there , not just playing a tennis match , but actually really relishing the experience . do you think that 's a testament to the new attitude ?
coming into this match , you did n't have a lot of success against top 4 players recently .
fair enough .
do you feel like you have something to do ? did you feel like coming into this match you had something to prove ?
do you think that getting a result like this , does that suggest your standard is as high as it used to be when you were at the top , or ...
how about your confidence levels ? i do n't mean here in the press conference , but when you walk out onto court , do you feel as confident as you did three or four years ago when you were at the very top of the rankings ?
i felt like you were enjoying yourself in the court , but you also seemed very ambitious .
in what way ? you seemed like you want to win this tournament . on a scale of 1 to 10 , how ambitious are you about winning this tournament ?
you mentioned taking advantage of some of the things that victoria was n't doing as well . what were some of the weaknesses you spotted today that you were able to take advantage of ?
two things : one , did you think that you might never get back to the yearend championships , no.1 , and secondly , you talked about some of the things you improved in your game , but do you think you 're a better player than when you were at no.1 or are you just trying to get back to that level ?
i mean more generally , though .
the second question ?
do you think you 're a better player ?
than 2008 or ...
more shots , but mentally ... sorry . you asked .
you had injury yesterday night . how this injury influence today 's game ? was there any influence ?
next year or soon the wta is expanding the championships in doubles to eight teams having round robin in doubles , too . just wondering , as a player who plays both singles and doubles , whether you like that idea or you like the current format more ?
today was announced russian team for fed cup final . it 's kleybanova , khromacheva , gasparyan , and panova . do you know someone from the girls except obviously kleybanova ?
it seemed like you could n't quite find your range out there . was that how it felt ?
what 's your assessment of the match ? was it all coming off of your racquet , or was there something she was doing that was particularly effective ?
lack of match play since the us open ?
practice ? well , you have been practicing , i would assume , the last ten days or so ?
how do you get yourself out of that other than just ball striking ?
so you sound a little mentally tired at this point of the season . is that fair to say ?
is it hard to sort of gather yourself for the last tournament here when also there is a break coming up that you really need ?
is that sometimes one of the toughest things to play , the yearend championships ? li na earlier was saying it 's hard , because she has her mind on vacation , to focus in on one of the biggest tournaments of the year , that there 's nothing for you to play for here in terms of like ranking or things like that . is that one of the mental challenges of playing this tournament ?
how are you physically ?
but what i mean is the injuries , you had to fight so hard to come back after wimbledon , and then you got sick in asia . is your body feeling well , or is it just a struggle to get yourself out there to play ?
seemed like a fairly comfortable start for you . i know you got here a little early , had time to feel out the conditions here . how is it suiting you so far out there on this court ?
does the court seem any quicker or slower or anything ? the balls this year ? some of the players said it seemed a bit slow for an indoor court .
i just want to know on that , what do you think would be the optimum speed for a court for a championship like this that will perhaps bring the best out of every single player when players are tired , players are looking to end the year ? what do you think would be the optimum speed for this kind of championship ?
on a similar point , would you like to see this tournament played on different surfaces ? do you think it 's a shame in some ways it 's always played on indoor hard court ?
it 's been a long season for you . when you get to the final tournament , do you start to kind of feel the fatigue and the tiredness , or are you still as fresh as you were maybe in the clay court season ?
the final tournament .
i saw your mom was here with you , and there was a report back in the states that venus had gifted her a house for 10 bucks . i was wondering if that was true ?
i was going to say , if it was true , how you were going to top it ?
part of i think the philosophy in having the championships move around is that they can plant seeds in different countries and cities , you know , with women 's tennis . i 'm just wondering if you think that actually works , you know , coming here three years and then playing up the stakes . does that leave any lasting legacy ?
could you imagine a turkish female champion tennis player in your lifetime ?
you played a lot of matches this year , more than any other year , but you generally have been injuryfree . do you think in some ways playing as much as you have has helped you in that ?
i saw the fan who was here last year you gave the racquet to , is back in the front row . have you had a chance to talk to him at all ?
after winning china open you went to paris to do the final preparation for championships , but next year the championships will move to singapore , and the same situation is that there are only two weeks between the china open and yearend championships , so would you consider maybe buy a house in hong kong so you will stay there to do the preparation and not to consider with the jet lag , those kinds of things ?
she served very , very well today . you broke her there once in the second and had a couple chances in the last game . seemed like it was hard to get into her service games ?
it was hard to get her into long points too . she seemed to be wanting to end it fast .
what is it about petra 's game that is , you know , difficult for you ? is it the lefthandedness ? is it the power ?
a lot of the players were talking about how slow the court has been here . do you feel like it makes it harder for you to play your game in terms of keeping the ball low or slices ? the slow high bouncing is not ideal ?
you have a tough turnaround for tomorrow 's match , just one day . next year when the championships move to singapore , the tournament is going to be expanded . you 'll have a few more days and you might have time to rest between matches . do you prefer a more compact championships like they have here , or do you want it kind of extended to give more time between matches ?
other than playing with your left hand , any new ideas you 're going to bring out against serena ?
you have played her fairly close , but do you feel like if you play aggressive and maybe take control of some of the points that you actually have a chance of maybe winning ?
obviously you have played her a lot recently , serena . is it something you think about a lot while you 're practicing or just in general ? like what to do differently ? or is it something you only think about when you have to play her ?
the first win kind of sets the tone for you . how do you feel right now ?
you have incredibly firstserve percentage today . it 's 75 % , best in your season . was it the key to win today ?
how did you feel about the conditions out there today ? a lot of players have talked about it being very slow , the court , and that the balls get very fluffy very quickly . do you feel the same way ?
tomorrow you get one day rest . do you think it 's good or it 's a little maybe early for you , for the rest to come so early ?
your serve and your forehand are always talked about as your weapons . tonight maybe your return of serve and your backhand you were also playing very aggressive . can you talk about those ?
no , that 's what 's talked about as your weapons . tonight your return of serve and your backhand were both good . you were playing aggressive .
do you think you do n't want to play another threesets match ?
you have answered this question before , but you have a very good record indoors . why do you like playing indoors so much ?
you and serena are in the same group . please talk about the matchup for you .
looking at your year , what would it mean to you to walk away from istanbul with a title here ? what would it mean for your year ?
you 're going to play the hopman cup with radek next year . when did you make this decision to play together in the tournament , and what kind of result do you think you will get ?
why you made the decision to play together .
yeah .
so that means you 're going to , if that means you 're going to train together in winter training time , or you are still going to train differently , separately , or ...
you said you were working on your serve before coming here . what was going on there where you felt like you needed to improve ? was there something specific that was not working for you ?
last year you won five games first match , and this year four games . what is difference between last year and this year , this match with serena ?
tomorrow you have a day off . is it maybe will be better for you to play , or is it good to have a day off tomorrow ?
talking about tonight 's game , obviously serena was very dominant in every aspect , but could you talk a little bit about what went wrong on your part ?
yes , on yourself . what went wrong on your part ?
you had a medical timeout in the second set . do you think that affects your performance towards the end of the match ? and now is it going to affect your next two matches , do you think ?
have you felt anything wrong before today , or was this something that occurred during the match ?
with the fed cup final coming up , is there any concern about how well you 're doing physically and whether you need to withdraw from this tournament ?
with the fed cup final , there have been a lot of reports out of russia that a lot of the russian players do n't want to play and they are choosing to play in sofia next week instead of fed cup , and maybe there will be no russians in the top 100 even at the fed cup final . just wondering what you think of that , what it says about fed cup right now .
on that topic , do you think that fed cup should have points or prize money ?
you 're going to play li na tomorrow . very different player from azarenka . do you think you 're going to come up with some new strategy to play , or you 're going to stick to the strategy you played today against azarenka ?
talking about today 's match , before you were injured you had the lead in the first set . then unfortunately it slipped away . can you talk about what changed in that first set from 52 ? was vika doing something better ? was it you ?
what do you think of the speed and the quality of the court ?
there has been a lot of talk about how hard courts have gotten slower over the past few years . have you noticed that even while you 're playing ? you think it 's allowed you to play better on hard courts maybe than you would have ...
you looked really fresh in this match . can you say this is your best match for a long time ? you looked very fresh in your match ?
in the first set before the pain , do you think it was your best match for a long time ?
li na plays very aggressive style of game . she tries to dictate the first points she have a chance to attack . so what do you think gon na be to key points for you to stay in the match and try to win in your way ?
it was a bit of a struggle but you got the edge in the end ?
do you know when a match is sort of going more slowly ?
when you have n't played in a while and you 're rusty and you 're an aggressive player , are you thinking , okay , now i need to dictate against her ? i also want to play patiently because i do n't want to commit too many unforced errors early ?
when you are at a tournament like this , do you approach the first round differently than you would at a normal tournament just because you know the competition is going to be at a higher level off the bat , or is it same as usual ?
we all know sara is a very good claycourt player , but what do you think makes her also a very dangerous player on hard court ? is it the variety of the way she plays the ball or her fighting spirit , she never gives up ?
because this is the showcase at the end of the women 's season , the speed of the court and the quality of the players are obviously very important to the game . what do you think of the speed of the court here , this championships ? do the players actually have any input into what they think would be the optimum speed of the court to bring the best tennis out at this stage of the season ?
while you were off a little bit and ill , were you reading the comments about whether women should or could play three out of five sets at the slams , and would you realistically be in favor about that ?
so what would be your preference ? if someone said you can either stay at two out of three or you can switch to three out of five , what would you say ?
she had a medical timeout in the second set . were you put off by it at all ?
so you said you felt a little bit rusty , but overall , how would you assess your performance tonight versus maybe your last couple of matches ? good , better , about the same ? where are you ?
last couple matches .
so it 's safe to say there is a lot of room still for improvement ?
clearly quality of results , which you have frequently , is more important than quantity , but have you played enough tennis tournaments this year to your satisfaction , or would you like to play more next year ?
when you were saying regarding tokyo and beijing that you did n't feel like you prepared well enough for the asian swing after the us open , what exactly did that mean ?
going off of that a little bit , what would be your ideal situation ? to have longer breaks after major tournaments where you can kind of shut down completely or , you know , a short break between tournaments to kind of just give your body a little bit of rest before you go into another one ?
is it hard to want to take that break ? for example , if you 're at the us open and you make the finals and you 're playing well and you want to capitalize on that momentum and go off and play a tournament immediately , is it difficult to make that kind of shift , or at this point in your career with your experience are you good with saying , no , i need a break ?
can you just talk about the bout of nerves when you served for the match twice in that second set ?
beginning of the tournament , any pressure on you to defend your title ?
it 's obvious that winning grand slams , they 're all special experiences . but to win it having to sort of face that adversity that you did in the second set , overcome whatever hiccups were there and come back and win dominantly like that in the third , do you relish it all the more to have done it that way ?
what are your thoughts on the milestones that are ahead of you in terms of majors , including steffi graf 's 22 , given that you 're only almost 32 years old ?
how does the way you 're playing right now compare with any other time in your career ?
you have been so dominant this year . did you feel like you kind of needed a second grand slam title ?
earlier this week victoria was talking about her x factor . help us out . what 's serena 's x factor ? what makes you so special as a champion on court ?
what was it like to meet president clinton ?
after the second set , what was your game plan or mentality going into the third ?
everyone talks about crissy and martina 's numbers and steffi and whatnot . you also just tied federer , someone in your era . does that mean anything to you ? and did you ever think about changing your dress ? in the wind seemed to be causing you some problems .
how much were you bothered by the wind out there ? and also , what do you think for you was the key in the third set ?
what was particularly unique about this grand slam journey ?
getting back to your strategy , your game plan for that third set , it appeared that you were deliberately taking some pace off the ball , making her generate the pace , substantially cutting down your unforced errors . was that part of it , or was i just seeing something that was n't quite there ?
i asked her that question , and she sensed you were taking some pace down , cutting down your unforced errors , and she said she did n't see that .
you and i saw it .
do n't you think i was out there with you , too ?
they were playing party like it 's 1999 on the sound system after you won . i 'm curious if you could describe the difference between winning tonight and winning in 1999 as a 17 year old , what you learned through that whole process .
which is basically the same question i was going to ask . you mentioned going to see clinton , and that would have been towards the end of his presidency , around the time you won this the first time . your appreciation for winning a grand slam , is it greater now than it was back at that time of your life ?
going back to 1999 , hypothetical question : if a 17 year old serena williams played a 31 year old serena williams , who would win it and why ?
a few moments ago , victoria said when two great champions meet the one who is more brave will prevail . if you could talk about that desire you had and the intensity with an opponent like victoria , what it takes to get over the top .
when you 're presented with the types of checks that you were tonight , what sense do you have of how much money you have earned in your career and what meaning does it have for you ?
do you have a sense of what your career earnings are ?
during the tiebreaker when you were changing sides , you really slowed down , took small steps . you were almost meditative in a way . what was going through your mind ? what were you reflecting on ?
you 're a pretty emotional person . can you just talk about the range of emotions you go through on court , celebrating , yelling , what you 're talking about when you seem super calm ? it seems like you 're trying to be real quiet .
do you think there will ever come a time when the usta will permit a coach to come down and calm you down for a moment in the game ? do you think there will ever come a time when a coach can come down maybe one time during the course of a match ?
any specific goals you have for yourself for this year ?
how long do you savor a slam victory before you kind of shift your thinking to the next match ? do you enjoy it for a while , or is it like ...
when the nerves come , is there any element that maybe as a 31 year old player you realize how special the opportunity is and maybe you 're more nervous than you would have been ten years ago ?
clinton said tonight that your greatest quality was that you never give up . do you think that 's true ? could you talk about that ?
the journey from the 17 years old serena winning the 17th single grand slam is long journey . how do you see looking back , how much you sacrifice 14 years ago winning a grand slam ? because you are an insider . you experience everything on the court . how much you have to sacrifice for this moment ?
can you just say a couple words about each member of your team who are here i think tonight ? all your sisters were here ? jill is here ; sascha is here ; patrick is here ; your physio is here . looks like they 're all packed in . just a word or two about each of them .
you have now won us open , wimbledon , australia each five times each . how do you sort of compare your road to those three tournaments ? are you surprised this one is sort of on level with those ? is this one that was sort of lagging behind ?
does something click for you here ?
wondering if you were following the men 's side and if you have any predictions for tomorrow .
great couple of weeks you have had here at the us open . i 'm wondering from a different perspective , as a woman , i think sometimes we are kind of conditioned to sort of hide our age or maybe lie about our age . you have been so successful for so long . do you feel weird or have any feelings towards when people reference you as sort of one of the older players or one of the veterans ? and what do you see for yourself in the next couple of years as well , still playing phenomenal tennis as you have described yourself ?
i know you said you could n't talk about all the family members and what they tell you , but your sister , venus , how much of a contribution does she continue to make ? what does she talk to you about before you go out to play ? how do you share things about careers ? she 's been there . that 's a real advantage .
you have played a lot of tournaments this year , especially in the past few months . but the season has n't been finished yet . do you think you will be physically okay to play asian season coming up ?
how would you describe your determination and serena 's determination once that match got going today ?
as it went on , how much did you feel that tension ?
that second set obviously was just an amazing comeback on your part .
talk about the emotions having completed , you know , and finished that set . but then going into the third set , was there a bit of almost a letdown emotionally ?
i will ask you about the wind . it seemed to be a major factor , especially for her . she seemed to be mistiming a lot of balls . you seemed to be able to keep finding corners a lot even after it was fairly gusty out there . was that just about footwork , and how much do you think that helped for your end , maybe an advantage for you maybe ?
you had fun talking about your x factor in a joking way the other day . on a serious note , what is serena williams ' x factor ? can you put into words what makes her so special as a champion ?
did you sense that in the early third of that final set serena was taking a lot of pace off the ball , making you generate all the pace ?
you have beaten her in big matches on tour . have n't beaten her in a slam yet . do you sense a big difference when her when you play her , and what do you think it will take from you to make that next step in a slam against her ?
looks like from the side that this one hurts worse than the one last year . is it really tougher to take this loss compared to last one ?
you handled serena 's serve pretty well for the most part all day . were you happy with your own serve ? do you think the wind affected it ?
do you think that it was the serve that actually made the difference today ? it was a pretty close match . it was n't a big difference . do you think that was the key ?
when you think about serena being close to 32 years old , having 17 majors , and the open era record being graf 's 22 , what are your thoughts on what her chances are to get that far , given that players like you and maria and others are still competing against her ?
were you conscious , when you lost the first set just six straight points from serena , did you think at all about last year 's match ? was there any sort of flashback ?
in the future , do you think you 'll see this as a tremendous opportunity lost , so close to our greatest championship in this country , or somehow do you think it will be a steppingstone ? can you talk about that ?
obviously the match stayed very , very tight ; always within a couple of games within each other until the third . just wondered what allowed her to get the distance from you as the third set wore on ?
you said the other day that serena pushes you to play your very best tennis . it was certainly on display out there tonight . serena was talking about you a couple days ago after her match , and she said that she 's watched you play , you know , other players , and that she feels that when you play her it 's like a different player at a different level . do you agree with that ? do you also then look at playing serena as an opportunity to take your game to another level that maybe other players do n't push you to ?
you mentioned that you 're eager to get right back out there , but what are you going to do for the next five to ten days ?
tonight ?
who is going to win the men 's final ?
how did he convince you ?
what do you think makes the difference today ? either you play too good or li na did n't play at all ?
when you were getting deep into the when you were in seventh match point , that eighth game in the second set , seemed like maybe that 's the only time we have seen you at this tournament with maybe a chink in your very gear . but then you seemed to rally back in the next one . is that about as far as you felt yourself pushed in this tournament at that point in the second set ?
what have you shown yourself about your game and getting to the final without losing more than four games against anybody and losing only four games one time in a set ?
what is the toughest part of playing azarenka , and how has she managed to win two of the last three matches , both on hard courts , with you ?
she said today that you make her play her best , and she said , i think i make her play her best , your best . do you agree with that assessment ? i mean , do you play your best tennis when you 're facing her ?
how different is the sort of level of intensity between us open final and the stages you have faced her already this year , in cincinnati and doha ?
how conscious are you that the mark of 18 major titles and that sunday you might just be one away from that ?
what about the potential $ 1 million bonus ? how conscious are you of that being at stake sunday ?
what does it take generally to beat you in a grand slam final ? like what does a player have to do in order to get the better of you ? because you are very good at these stages .
do you feel like the two matches she 's won this year you have largely beat yourself ?
the other day you said that chris evert , martina , and steffi were the ultimate icons in tennis for you . did watching them influence your game at all ?
but in terms of seeing their games , there were n't things that you took from watching those previous icons ?
how much of your preparation for the final is looking at azarenka 's game and how you want to try to attack her or hurt her as opposed to focusing on what you want to do about yourself ?
i know you said a lot of times before that azarenka is one of the players you 're friendlier with on tour . do you have to actively put that aside next few days and think of her as someone you 're not friendly with ?
what 's the most exciting aspect for you being in the final again with a chance to win a fifth open title ?
and how do you guard against the nervousness of being in the final and knowing that if you do n't win it it 's going to be a tremendous letdown for you ?
does tennis need a great grand slam every so often , a great competitive one ?
vika also said that she really relishes pressure . she feels pressure brings out the best in her game . you have obviously had great meetings with her . do you feel the more you push her it raises her level ? and also , what does that do for your game ?
this was a long day for you out on the court . i noticed even towards the very end of the match you and venus were still able to kind of able to share a laugh or a smile . i 'm wondering , at this point , have you been focused throughout the whole tournament on tennis , or are you allowing yourself some space for pleasure outside of the tournament while you 're here in newyork ?
about the doubles today , i notice obviously a team you have had a lot of tough matches against at the olympics . what do you think made the difference in that ?
could you just first of all reflect on not only the match but on the tournament , what it 's meant for you ?
this was a great run for you to the semifinals . just talk about the positives .
how do you explain all those breaks of serve , 13 of them ?
you have had like some great wins here before , you know , a few years ago , maria and many others . it 's a great court for you . now coming back from some injury , you play such inspiring tennis . do you think sometimes being away a little bit makes you maybe want it more , playing more , giving more of yourself ?
she 's only lost once on hard courts this year . what makes her a little bit of a more complicated difficult player versus clay or grass ?
a good reach ?
at times it seems like in that second set she changed a little bit also the pace . she would hit some angle shots . you know , like she also played very smart i think against you .
did you notice that , that she would just try to open the court ?
you were able to turn things around after a very disappointing first set .
particularly that second to last game . the eighth game you fought off six or seven six match points , i believe . talk about the fact that you were able to come back and fight in the end . do you take consolation from that ?
you have been talking a lot about the change in your style , coming to net more , becoming more aggressive . you can see how that 's worked for you in this tournament . even when the match is just over , are you able to look back in the tournament and take a lot of positives out of it ?
it was a tougher match than the scoreline showed , and it took 13 minutes to win one game . i just wanted to ask you about what are the special challenges of facing serena ? what does it feel like to be on the other side of the net from her ?
what was the situation in the first set ? you had a lot of unforced errors , double faults . were you nervous ? what was it that you were able to kind of recover in the second ?
the one time you beat serena you lost the first set 6love . did that come into your mind at all after you lost the first set ?
i want to ask sort of a fun question after a tough loss .
we know you said that carlos saved your marriage . now , with serena , she 's being coached by her boyfriend . now that you have been through all this , what would be the advice you would give to serena for being coached ?
so it 's the guy 's fault ?
talk about the opportunity to get back out there in a grand slam final against serena .
just talk about are you happy with the way you played out there ?
away from tennis , you have quoted the pointer sisters twice now today , i 'm so excited , and i danced to marvin gay . i just wanted to ask you , you have sort of a special window into motown with the gordy family . i just wanted to ask you about that whole experience , your discovery of classic r & b .
if you could follow me here , two very different questions . just to extend , who are your favorite motown artists or favorite songs ?
and then on a serious tennis basis , how do you think vika 's , your game , has changed this year from last year on hard courts ? can you break it down ?
you 're a more complete player in what way ? if you could just extend on that briefly .
you always say what 's in the past is in the past , i do n't look back , only looking forward . as you approach the final , do you make an exception there and think back on the wins you have had over serena this year , or is it the same thing , clean slate , new match , you do n't care what happened in the past ?
in your wins you have had over serena this year , what is it in your game that you think has matched up against her game ?
how do you get serena out of her comfort zone ? not many people are able to do that .
you seem to have become a specialist winning tough matches .
are there other players from either the past or present who inspire you who you like to watch like in a mental capacity ?
in the evolution of your rivalry with serena , how much does confidence matter for you ?
what do you mean overrated ? do you mean that execution is more important , or what would be more important than that ?
quickly on the tournament , just watching you serve over the last couple of years and then in this tournament , it seems like the speed is a little bit down and the placement which you always consider to be more important is not there . is that the wind , or are you a little bit sore in the hip ? you 're not hitting it the way you want to ?
what gives you the most belief when you play against serena ?
you have had success against her two out of the last three times . what do you think is the common denominator ?
can i ask you again about pennetta and the matchup today ? she lost eight times the serve out of nine . you made four double faults first two games . it was tension ? pressure ? the wind ? what was the reason for that , so many breaks in the match ? how do you rate this match ?
how do you rate her performance ?
you have been playing so beautifully , so powerfully , but it 's my sense that fans are still trying to get to know you , even though you have been on tour for a while . the other day we spoke about red foo and the x factor and all that . what 's the x factor in your life ? what can you tell fans about what they do n't know about you or what makes you tick ?
how do you think that your friendship with serena has affected the oncourt sort of intensity of your matches compared to matches you both play against players you 're not maybe not as friendly with ?
only one of the two finalists can come out of it . you are a double grand slam winner . what does that say to you about this match coming up and how it will reflect on your respective seasons ?
you 're one of the best , if not the best , at redirecting the ball on the wta . i wanted to ask you if you think that 's going to be really key up against serena .
stefan seems very , very comfortable interacting with the public all the time , and i 'm sure you have seen that a lot . does that help you learn how to take it easy and interact with the public ?
he has n't gotten you to sing in public yet ?
and you dance on court a little bit .
if you win the title , maybe singing on court ?
you and flavia are obviously good friends . what did she say to you at the end of the match ?
nothing more personal ?
it seems to us like a very special occasion when the two of you play , especially those of us who are n't italian and know your stories so well . does it feel like a special occasion to you , too ?
what would you say is flavia 's best qualities as a player and as a person since you know her so well ?
i know it 's disappointing , the result , but what positives do you take from the week and a half that you have been here ?
yeah , the positive .
many people see your game and say that it 's a game from a different period maybe , that it 's very different from the way most women play today with your use of slice and coming to the net so much . do you feel this yourself , that you 're a little bit different from these other women ?
do you remember the first time you ever played flavia , how old you were then ?
and what was that match like , do you remember ?
and do you remember when you guys became friends ?
do you remember what it was about her and about you that kind of clicked ?
your ranking has improved a lot this year .
are you doing anything different ?
why do you think that women are able to play later into their careers now ?
you have made three quarterfinals here and now your first semifinals . what is it about newyork that brings out the best in your game ?
you have such a long relationship with her . it seems very special to some of us to see you guys playing . you 're both late in your careers and stuff . does it feel that way to you ?
do you remember the time that you first became friends and what kind of sparked your friendship ?
do you remember when you first became friends with her and what might have sparked your friendship , what maybe you had in common ?
since you know her so well , can you say what you think is the best quality in your game and what is the best quality in her personality ?
was it tough then to know that about her , and at the same time to know that only one of you was going to reach the semifinal ?
normally i do n't like to talk about age or ask about age , but you are 31 and roberta is 30 , right ? once errani said it was maybe italian grow a little bit slower compared to other countries .
do you agree with that ?
what does that mean to you ? talk about this run . you have n't lost a set yet . i mean , to be honest , if you look at the results prior to coming in , there is n't much to say that you would be in a situation that you are in right now .
and after coming off of this match and going into a semifinal of a grand slam , what is your level of confidence right now ?
why do you think that there are so many women now who are able to play into their 30s at a really high level ? what 's changed over the last 15 years ?
you talk about the confidence level , but the semifinal is a little bit uncharted territory for you . no italian , male or female player , has reached the final in the us open history . you can be the first one ; just one step away . how big the challenge and the pressure that all country is watching you and ...
in singles she has a way of making people crazy because her style is so different from everybody else . how is it for you today , and in the past is it because you 're so accustomed to her ?
how happy are you with that win , the way you played today ?
not so happy ?
with all of the traveling the players do throughout the year on the tour , how do you handle the long flights from asia to different parts of the world ? have you found ways to make it easier on your body when you have these 18 , 20hour flights ?
you have joked about your husband snoring before you have matches and things like this . has it taught you now that you can sleep on a flight ? now you can sleep through anything , having to deal with this ?
how proud are you becoming the first chinese player through to the us open semifinals ?
you mentioned nerves were a problem early . was that a problem on the double fault in the tiebreaker ? and then what did you do to turn the match around in the third set ?
serena is a pretty good player . if you face her in the semis , how can you beat her ? will you eat anything special for breakfast that morning ?
aside from saving your marriage , what has carlos given the most in addition to that ?
why do n't you listen to your husband ? is he a bad man ?
vika was saying the other day that she really likes pressure and that pressure brings out the best in her tennis . you were talking about the nerves today . obviously going into a semifinal match , potentially facing serena williams , i can imagine a more pressurecooking situation . how do you respond to pressure , and how do you think that you 'll challenge that in your next match ?
when you play serena , how critical is the serve against her , holding serve ?
well , in other words , because she 's such a strong server , how much pressure is there on everybody she faces to match that serve ?
china has many big cities . what is the biggest difference and similarity between new york and cities in china ?
how hard was it yesterday ? you 're playing then you 're not playing , and then you have to come back this morning . were you guys upset about that at all ?
very good , close match today . what was the difference in your mind at the end ?
you were talking last week about just wanting to get back to that no.1 position and that you had a strategy for doing that . you played very well here . you played her well in carlsbad and even better today . can you talk about some of the positives in the context of what you 're trying to do in terms of regaining no.1 ?
did you feel like she was playing her best today ?
you came out really going for winners today . was that a strategy that you had determined that you were just going to hit it all out ?
you broke her almost as much as she broke your serve , but you lost eight of your last ten service games . what kind of pressure did that put you under ?
mentally was that difficult when you 're , you know , sort of coming very close to getting control again of the match , yet you get broken . is that difficult to deal with mentally ?
what do you think you need to do better to be with the top players ?
she had that dropshot going . she did n't make a single mistake on that . were they a little demoralizing , a little difficult ?
the other day you said how hard you work , but tennis is a pretty tough sport . most players every tournament go home dealing with loss . how do you deal with loss ? i mean , do you reflect on it ? is it something that grates on you ?
players like to say they do n't look ahead , but it 's pretty hard for me to believe you guys are n't aware now of where you are in a draw and what might happen . does that play a factor going out there , knowing that , well , you know , you 've got winnable matches ?
it was again a big battle today . how do you think you did ?
do you feel like you 're at any kind of a disadvantage being a day behind ? do you think anything could have been done to change that yesterday ?
do you feel like your game right now is at the same level where it was when you beat serena in cincinnati ?
you became a dropshot maniac .
i had the feeling that the way ana start the match being so aggressive and so many winners , 17 just by the end of the first set , left you a little bit annoyed and nervous for the rest of the match . am i right ?
no ?
there was a point in the first set where you maybe accidently hit yourself with the racquet in the leg . after one point in the first set you were looking at your leg like you might have hit yourself with the racquet a little bit . is that just kind of the way it was going ?
did you feel serve at some point is hurting your game the past couple of weeks ?
can you talk about the matchup with daniela ?
of the eight women in the quarters , five of them are over the age of 30. is there something about the way the game is now that allows women to play kind of deeper into their careers ?
i understand that red foo is in australia ; is that right ?
why is he there ?
so you 're beside yourself without him by your side ?
i am just joking around .
the joke was that you were beside yourself without him by your side , and it will affect your down the line backhand , i 'm sure .
today , from the end of the first set to the start of the second , you guys broke each other seven straight times . then it seemed like you took control when you held your serve a couple of times there in ...
including the end of the first ?
you spoke a moment ago of daniela as a shotmaker . what are the other attributes you think of when you think of her game and also the fact that she 's been on the tour as long as she has ?
are you concerned about the slow starts , two matches in a row ?
yeah , are you concerned ?
you said the other day that you really relish pressure , that you like pressure . is that one of the qualities that can help you bounce back from being down a set and able to come back and play hard ?
how much did that come in to play , especially in the third set when she looked like she was turning the tide around coming back on you ?
when you come off court , are you more pleased when you won the match that takes a lot of fight or just the overall ?
i guess , i mean , you 've won two slams now . you are going into possibly the last three matches . how much more do you think you can improve ? like what percentage do you think you 're playing now ?
in your gut , do you think you can win this year ?
you know what it takes to win a grand slam . are you happy right now where your game is at going into the quarterfinals ?
congratulations . how did you feel out there playing your countrywoman ?
with all of the travel that tennis players do throughout the year , how do you handle the long flights to asia and australia ? will you allow yourself to upgrade for these flights to make it easier on your body ?
how important was it for you to get the match in before the rain started ?
what would you say is the key to your success these past two years ? because you were always around 20 to 40 , and now you are closer to top 10. did you change something , or is it more just understanding of your game ?
can you talk a little bit about the fact that there are so many italian women right now climbing up the ranks ?
are you close ?
are all of you italian players close together ? are you friendly ?
what would you say has been the key to your rivalry with errani ? obviously you guys are very good friends , but you have won the last two matches you have played against her and broken the streak . what would you say has been the key for you to come through with the wins against her this summer ?
you guys are best friends and you play the same tournaments together , play doubles together , practice together , travel together . do you ever feel like , i need a break ?
how did you feel in terms of being in the stadium today ? camila has been on such a rise and there were so many fans cheering for her . they 're really loud on the court .
how did you manage the threeandahalf hour rain delay ?
what did you eat ?
was it mentally difficult knowing that you had that momentum going into the second set , to then have to stop for so long ?
what was overwhelming about being on ashe today to start the match ?
when you came out after the rain delay , it seemed like you were trying to force the issue more , get inside the baseline to receive serve . did you change your strategy at all ?
what happened in the third set for you ? seemed like you struggled a little bit . was it in your head or something with your game ?
what do you put it down to ?
who did you talk to during the delay ?
given your results at wimbledon and here , your ranking is going to improve . probably going to be a key that unlocks the ability for you to get into tournaments . purses will be larger . looking ahead , what is the impact of this summer on your potential ?
were you surprised with the way she served so well throughout the whole match ?
you said you lost focus in the third set . did the nerves come back a little bit there ? what was that because of ?
are you going to stick around or is it back to pittsburgh ?
is there one thing through these two weeks that really sticks out for you , a memory or a moment , that you 'll take with you ?
you and roberta have split in terms of all the matches you 've faced each other . what is your strategy going into the quarters ?
that seems to be a theme for the past couple years in terms of italian women facing each other . you 're facing her in doubles as well .
can you talk about this sort of italian renaissance that you guys are having .
i 'm sure you 've been talking about this a lot the last couple weeks , but discuss how difficult it was to come back from wrist surgery .
how did you not get discouraged by the losses ? you had a good wimbledon , but then the weeks after that were difficult . then you come here and it 's 2009 again .
i guess some players will say this place is special , that place is special . maybe they 're not telling the truth . but you have had very good results here . when you start playing on the courts here , do you think it does n't matter what happened the last few months , maybe the great form will come back again ?
it 's your fourth quarterfinal .
time for the semifinals now .
do you feel nervous about it ?
you said after your match against sara that whatever happens on the court , you were going to go out to dinner afterwards . do you feel the same way about facing roberta ?
so you go out no matter what ?
good comeback in the third set . at the end of the second , she played pretty well to even it , but then you got control again .
when was the last time you served so well ?
do you know the ace count ?
when you think of the us open in general , you 've had high moments and moments where you ended up out in the first round . what does it mean to you when you look at the us open on the calendar every year ? is it something you look forward to ?

talk really about why .
how did you handle the rain delay ?
did you nap or eat ?
a lot of women you played against when you were in the quarterfinals here last time are no longer playing . what is it about you ?
many of the lowerranked players have come and gone . what keeps you on the tour ?
do wins and losses matter less than they did , say , 10 years ago ?
because ?
what has the process been like playing with hingis ?
even though you 're veterans , you still need the confidence of a secondround win in sandiego to build on things ?
do you feel like that partnership with martina has helped your singles game at all ?
you are 30. do you have the same motivation on the tour right now ?
what is it like on your nerves ? you played alison twice before on grass , but when you go out there in a situation like this , you know she 's playing kind of above her ranking , is it particularly nervewracking to go out against somebody like that ?
is it strange when you come into these press conferences to be told over and over you 're older when in real life you 're so young ?
why do you think there are more women playing into their 30s now ?
for women you have your fitness training that you do , weight training . probably more than men you 're also judged maybe on how you look . how tough is that to deal with ?
how did you feel about the match today in general ?
were you surprised about how many people came to watch you and were cheering for you this whole time ? the stadium was totally full almost .
obviously disappointed today , but when you look back , how do you assess your overall performance ? you had the big win against caroline . overall in the tournament .

was it a highquality match from both players ? did you feel that way out there ?
there were reports that when venus went vegan to manage her sjogren 's , you initially supported the diet to be supportive . have you kept that diet up ?

you really made her move around a lot . talk about your movement , your defense .
did you feel like you had to hang in there a little bit longer to get some errors from her , as well ?

with all the hype that came around this match , do you think there will be any problem for a possible letdown in the next round ?
when you talk about your focus , did it feel more than a fourthround match to you ?
the one thing sloane has to work on to get to the next level , what do you think it is ?
do you go out there with the idea in your mind that you 're not going to upstage me on a big stage again ? you 're a fierce competitor .
you had a brief exchange at the end of the match at the net with sloane . what was that about ?
that was a very big celebration for you for a fourthround match in a slam . why ?
to the box , when you pirouetted .
roger and rafa have never played here before .
against each other ( laughter ) .
if you had to say which one is greater , roger with his 17 slams or rafa who has a 2110 advantage over roger , can you pick ?
if you ca n't beat the guy in your era ... it 's a hard choice to make . if you were dominated by somebody , it would be hard to say you were the best player of your era .

who among the others are the best , would you say ?

what do you think you need to do to get to the next level ?
do you feel you need to be or want to be any stronger ?
physically .
were you impressed by her defense particularly ?
there is your rivalry , but let 's talk about the real rivalry : nike versus under armour . you 're probably under armour 's highest profile athlete . did nike make an attempt to sign you ?
phil knight did n't say , sloane , come on over and join us ?
can you assess where you were last year and how your game has changed .
you looked incredibly calm , almost detached out there . is that something you work on ? is it difficult to keep that really cool , poised attitude ?

you 're the youngest in the 16 that were left . does that mean anything to you ?
you 've been talked about as the heir apparent to serena . what is your reaction to that ?
in the entire first set and a half , the intensity and confidence and focus that you had with serena was matched like 100 % . did you notice the moment that intensity changed ? seemed like right at 31 serena relaxed a little . i did n't know if that changed your focus towards the game . did you feel it ? did it affect you , that intensity change ?
is there any part of you that wishes you could be on the opposite side of the draw from her in a major , that you were n't constantly placed as such in draws where there she is ?

are you going to play mixed doubles with jack sock ? you two were simply adorable .

what do you think are the keys to your win today ?
you had great results in the grand slams this year . at this particular tournament you have not gone past the fourth round before . do you find this to be `` the '' most difficult of the grand slams ? and also , considering the results you have had , would not making it into the quarterfinals be a real disappointment for you this year ?

you mentioned your doubles . what about the future of your singles ?
do you feel your body can continue to go ?
because of all your health issues , how has that affected your appreciation for the game of tennis ?
because of your health issues , people always bring up the thought of retirement . how much more do you have in the tank ?
a lot of the younger players coming up , u.s. players , especially young women of color , always mention how they were motivated as young kids by yourself and serena . is that a source of pride for you or more big picture down the road to analyze ?
is one of the hardest parts that you played so well in these first two matches after missing wimbledon and could have potentially made a run in this tournament ?
you 've had some endurance issues . were you encouraged by how much you had in that third set ?
going back to althea , zina , many fine african americans , obviously you and serena have taken it to a whole new dimension . now we see a surge in american young players , but many of them like sloane and madison , taylor are african americans . does that give you a certain pride and could you reflect on that ?

chuntering .
is that something you 're working open ?

how pleased are you with the way you coped with being seeded in a grand slam for the first time ?
what do you feel are the biggest improvements you 've made over the past 12 months ?
you played a lot of big matches on big courts at the slams . do the nerves get easier to deal with at this point , or are you just as nervous now as you were back when you played sharapova at wimbledon , li na last year , clijsters last year ?
will there be a different kind of expectation because you 're going in as a fellow seed whereas last year you were 89 and she was 8 .
are you pleased with the match today , the way you played ?
how much of a relief is it to get your match in ? you have been through rain delays in the past here . how relieving is it to get that one under your belt ?

the shoulder ? seems the shoulder is bothering you on and on . is it something you can get rid of at some point ?
do you find this the most difficult of the grand slams ? you have not had your best results here in terms of the depth , how far you have gone in the tournament . for you , is this the most difficult of the grand slams for you ?
petra said the other day she finds it very difficult to deal with , you know , the crowds and so forth . many others do . just every one of the four have their own atmosphere and so forth . this one is known for being a bit rowdy and with crowds . do you thrive off that or do you find that a bit distracting ?
and beyond quarterfinals ? would quarterfinals be enough ?
sorry to hear about your grandfather . can you just talk about your relationship with him , his influence on your career ? it was your father 's father or mother 's father ?
just talk about your relationship with him and , you know , how well you knew him growing up . the other day you were talking about he was a big sportsman .
so you would talk to him ? when you would come home he 'd talk to you about all your matches ? did he watch as many matches as he could ?
did he offer you a lot of advice about your tennis ?
you pulled out of cincinnati and went back home and came back again . how was that whole experience ?
i know you had great success and you have had disappointments . did it put things a little bit in perspective for you ?
in perspective , meaning you have had great triumphs , you have had disappointments , but then there are things that come up in life . did it give you a certain type of perspective ?
a few years ago your father was here when you and urszula were playing back out on the far courts , before you became aga . can you talk a little bit about his influence , and since he 's not around quite as much as he used to be ?
do you talk to him about your tennis , or do you now talk to him , as you said , whether about your grandfather or about life ?
fashion question . i 'm sorry . how do you pick the outfits you 're wearing for grand slam ? do you have a say in what you 're wearing ? and what is the key for when you 're picking it out ?
do you ever say , i want this color or i do n't want this shape ? do they decide or ask you what you prefer ?
it 's a very long season and this is the last grand slam . do you come in here feeling mentally fresh ?
good performance out there today . are you happy with the way you played ?
we do n't have a crystal ball yet , but you may be seeing laura in the next match .
she 's obviously your last match last year .
possible matchup with laura , your thoughts ?
how satisfied are you with the way you 're playing right now ?
how difficult is it to start working with a new coach ? what does he have to do ? what do you have to do to adjust to each other so that it 's a good working relationship ? and how long did it take for you and carlos ?
is that the most important thing , to know each other , or the technical things he can help you with ?
for you .
is it funny that men and women both at a certain age still need coaches . what do you need a coach to help you do ?
could you ever imagine not having a coach and being out here ?
with the rain , you just beat the rain , so i 'm sure you 're happy about that . not all players are in the same situation ; some are playing their firstround match today or tonight . what do you think about the scheduling here ?
but what about everyone else ?
going through the second set in your mind , what stood out as the momentumturning points ?
are you happy with the way you played today ?

in your career , a lot of great runs , and some setbacks , as well . over the years , what do you think is the best advice you 've gotten ? if you could , just reflect on that for a minute .
you have had contacts with a number of other sports . which sport , boxing or golf , has given you more , and have you learned more from it ?
the american boxer tex cobb said boxing is n't like tennis . you get one hit and it 's your ass . you 're out of there .
sounds like wozniacki on court .

he says he does n't get real stressed out about watching you . do you not get stressed out about watching him ?
crissy , chris evert , on tv had some nice words to say about you . she also said if she were you could you use another pair of eyes , and if she were you she 'd run out and grab thomas hogstedt . he 's had great success . would you consider him as a possibly helping you in the future ?
a question about your opponent . not so many chinese girls so big and hitting so hard . what 's your assessment of her future on the tour ?
i think i saw your dog earlier today . what kind of dog is it ? how old is it ? what 's its name ? how often does it travel ?
djokovic said his dog pierre has gotten healthy since he went nongluten . would consider the same for bruno ?
you almost got out of it there at the end . take us through the match , particularly the last couple games .
at the end did you feel she was trying to close it out ? hard for young players to close matches like that .
did you have trouble reading her serve ?
what exactly did she do from your perspective that was surprising ?
do you think by any chance you underestimated her ?
do you think the sort of unusual leadup you had to this tournament made it harder to come out of the gates here ?
coming in , did you feel in practice you were hitting the ball well , moving well ? any indication in practice things were n't going well ?
what about her game was the most difficult for you tonight ?
you spoke about the technical aspects . what were your thoughts of her poise in the big situations ?
what happens now with the coaching thing ? put the feelers out ? take a bit of time ?
what do you make of your year as a whole ?

why do you think this , of the grand slams , is the one you have had the least success ?
do you like the american swing other than your results ? i mean , have you enjoyed that part other than you have n't won as much as you like ?
it was a strong outing , firstround match . you played well . are you pleased with how the match went ?
how did you feel coming into the tournament this year ?

can you talk a little bit about your new team ?
how long have you been working together ?
are you working on any specific things , you know , with the game ?
it 's reported this week a friend of yours from serbia passed away . you used to practice with women him . are you playing with heavy heart this week ?

have you talked to novak for tips on twitter , or rafa ?
how would you describe your emotions at the end of that match ?
how does someone go from losing quarterfinals of 18s nationals to beating the 2011 us open champion in a matter of weeks ?
nerves closing out the match there ?

you did n't have any aces today . how do you feel about where your serve is now ?
when you finally scored the winner on match point , what flooded through your mind ?
you lost to clijsters i believe last year . after that match , if someone said , do n't worry , next year you 'll win against the us open champion , what would you have said ?
how much did the qualifying for this elevate your game ? did you get some toughness out of this , some technique ?
how much did you think about last year 's match against clijsters on ashe ?
have you talked to billie since your win ?
what did she say ?
you were at bollettieri 's the week before the open . who are you working with now ?
even though you had the great wins in qualifying , good junior success , i 'm sure you were aware who stosur was when you walked on court . did you feel you had the game to play with her ?
it 's been a couple hours . have you thought about what this means for you ?
do you remember the moment you fell in love with tennis ?
for people who are getting familiar with you , how would you describe your personality on and off the court ?
how did that mentality manifest itself in tonight 's match ?
can you clarify with your growth spurt , how tall are you and how much do you weigh now ?
you 're not the working with bollettieri at the moment ?
we 're in the interview in arthur ashe stadium .
were you aware about 20 years ago he was in a protest for the rights of haitian refugees in washington and was arrested at that time ?
arthur ashe .
i do n't think he was around when this stadium was built .
he was at the us open the day before that occurred .
can you talk about your path from when you won the 10andunder tournament to becoming a very good junior with your parents , was it financially difficult , teaching , all of that ?
your dad went back to haiti during the earthquake while you were in florida ?
talk about the role harry kitchen had in your life .
tell the story . how did he come to send the helicopter for your family ?
what is his profession ? what does he do in the atlanta area , mr. kitchen ?
how is your dad today ? is he able to work ?
talk about your experience with the crowd . they were chanting 'usa ' the third set . what was that like for you ?
i know you said earlier in the year your favorite sponge bob character is gary .
but he 's a snail . you seem like you 're very much not in your shell . you seem very comfortable .
was there some incident when you were in haiti when you were kidnapped or abducted as a child ?
your whole family was ?
how old were you ?
did you see the video of your family celebrating after you won the match ?
do you think victoria duval is going to become a tennis star ?
how much were you aware of the success of sloane and madison and taylor ? do you pay attention to that and get inspiration ?
what do you know about hantuchova next ?
kind of hairy .
tough to get through , complicated and difficult .
can you talk about the match , what was going on with the different sets .
you had a lot of unforced errors . was that the key , cutting down on those ? i think you had more than 50 .
were you more nervous than at any of the other slams this year ?
you anticipated some points . are you going to get comfortable with it , these big tournaments ? you do pretty well at them .
when you said you wanted to play free , what does that mean to you ?
how did you pull that out in the thirdset tiebreaker ?
you were down 42 in the third set , and then immediately broke her serve , winning four straight points . what changed in your mindset at that point ?
what are your thoughts on james blake 's retirement and what his example has meant to young players who have been coming up , such as yourself ?
do you get less nervous as the rounds go on ?
you 've already built a reputation for playing your best at big moments . today continued that . what is it about the big stage when a match is on the line that allows you to persevere ?
were you more nervous today than you 've been in a very long time , since you were a little kid perhaps ?
late in the match on one side of armstrong the crowd was cheering with one chant , and on the other side was a competition of a sloane stephens chant . can you translate that in terms of performance and how it affects you ? is it all positive ?
what is the best piece of advice you 've ever gotten on court during a match ?
at 42 in the third set , looked like you took a break . did you say anything to yourself that helped ?
topsyturvy first set , but you came through that well and blew her away in the second .
more satisfying because you really have to sort of grafted it out ?
how is the wrist feeling ?
any pain at all ? anything during the match ?
how beneficial was the time you spent down in bradenton recently or in terms of fitness and everything ? you look extremely strong out there today .
coming in as a seed , getting to 54 , 65 that first set , i guess there was expectations on you . you seemed to put it together what you needed to at that point , or was the pressure too much ?
were you expecting to find it difficult just because you have n't played that much in the last couple months ?
do you still feel good walking in here knowing what you have done in the past ? is there a sense of greater anticipation when you have come back to somewhere where you have done well ?
what do n't you like about dan ?
still nice to see a friend do well , though ?
you going to give him any advice ? he 's going to come into interview room 1 in a minute .
bright orange , did you pick that ? you being stylish ?
kevin is wearing orange .
is orange the new black ?
i thought it was peach .
garcia has match point . assuming she wins , have you played her before ?
have you heard about her or aware of her ?
last year in the second round you won against kim clijsters . what do you remember about this match and this moment ?
how does it feel to be in the main draw slam locker room again ?
are you surprised you won that fight today ?
do you think your game is slowly back to what it was ?
do you realize maybe the impact your story has on people in tennis and outside ? people are happy you won today .
how much did all those small tournaments you played help get you to the us open ?
the day that you announced that you had hodgkin 's , i think on your website it said , alisa kleybanova defeats hodgkin 's lymphoma 6love , 6love . was that your idea ?
is that what you thought , though , at the time ? were you that confident that you 'd be able to get through it and come out of it on the good side ?
have you kept in touch with andy roddick since the world teamtennis ended ?
would you say you changed in any way after all you 've been through as a person or as a player ?
have you spoken at all with ross hutchins , an atp doubles player ?
have you ever played in a match where there were 23 breaks in 27 games ?
have you noticed other people , i think like today both delpotro and li na were doublefaulting a lot on big points . was there something in the air here that 's throwing off serves ?
what were the keys today to your win ?
speaking of movement , you had a lot of interesting reactions after points today . you were moving a lot . there were a lot of like gifts that this match made essentially .
a good montage on the broadcast of like all of them from the match like back to back to back .
there 's some good stuff on the internet already .
we did n't get to talk to you after you played caroline . just curious , where do you think caroline 's form is at right now ? you guys have n't played in a while either .
what are you most pleased about from the week and even going back to carlsbad , about your game , kind of after wimbledon ? like technically , specifically , serve ? movement ?
i 'm throwing it out there .
can players fall out of shape with respect to competing and their ability to compete ? have you ever felt that ? like when you come off of a long break , like maybe you had after wimbledon or something , that it takes a few matches to kind of remember how to like tonight you competed very well .
serena next , obviously a tough opponent for you . you did get a win , first one in a while , over her in del mar . does that match give you more confidence than you 've had in past years against her ? and what do you make of what 's going to happen tomorrow ?
you 've had two very late night matches , and now you have to turn around for a 4:00 p.m. start . how are you going to pace yourself ? how are you going to steady yourself for the final tomorrow ?
jelena , what is it about cincinnati ? you seem to just play some of your best tennis here .
jelena , you 've been playing well in doubles as well . how much is that helping your singles results ?
so you thought you played really well today . in the first set , obviously , you dominated . do you feel a light come on after struggling in the other matches , like , i 've got it back now ?
playing so well today , how does that help you moving forward now ?
she had , i think , six breakpoints at one point in the second set , and you won them all . that must help your confidence too ; that really hurt hers .
sloane , jelena said she felt like it was a tough game for both of you guys servingwise . would you agree with that ? can you talk about how you played out there today .
big win for you last round and did n't get it done today . what is your overall assessment of your time here in cincinnati looking for preparation going forward ?
sloane , what are the positives that you take away from the week ? obviously a big win against maria and this loss , but what are the positives that you take away ?
you 're playing new haven . how much more time do you need before the open before you feel like you 're pretty much there ?
sharapova was asked , after she lost to you , was she maybe going to try to get another tournament in next week . she said she never does the week before a slam no matter what , but you always do .
sloane , what were you thinking at 55 in the third ? does the crowd support help at a time like that ?
what are those last little things you want to fine tune in new haven ?
physically feeling okay ? abs holding up ?
you 're starting to play a lot of bigger names in women 's tennis back to back more often now . how does that equate to your preparation for the game versus earlyround matches ?
sloane , what was your reaction to the news that marion bartoli called it quits , walked away from it all ?
i know , obviously , you 're probably decades away from retiring yourself . have you ever thought about how you 'd want to go out ?
you would n't want to have your retirement dinner at applebee 's ?
have you talked to any other players about it ? has it been big buzz in the locker room , i would imagine , about it ?
she said last night her reasoning was that everybody 's going to remember her as the wimbledon champion and not where she retired , so it does n't matter . make sense to you ?
sloane , what was it like playing jelena ? she 's been around the tour for a long time . but playing her actually versus seeing her .
sloane , how would you describe your mood going into new york ? are you nervous ? excited ? both ? what ?
sloane , are you past the stage yet that names on a draw board do n't mean anything to you anymore ? you 've arrived , you know you belong . so it does n't freak you out to see a big name on the board anymore ?
victoria , that was a solid first match . dug out of some early trouble and seemed to find your rhythm . how are you feeling after canada now ? you feel back to full strength roughly ?
how surprising is it to have this cool weather ? i mean , everybody usually comes to cincinnati thinking they 're going to get heat preparation for the open , and it 's been a bit cool the last couple of days .
vika , sorry if someone already asked this , but there were 13 service breaks in your match , including in the last seven games . could you just talk about that and maybe the frustration of having that happen .
victoria , where were you when you found out about the big announcement from marion bartoli ?
what do you make of her decision to walk away about a month after winning wimbledon ?
what are you going to remember most about her ? i mean , you had a bunch of tough matches against her over the course of your career . she 's the one who ended your streak last year in miami . but you also had a lot of wins over her obviously too . what will you remember most about her when you 're retired , when you look back at her career ?
vika , you 're at the top of your game and you 're very young , but can you think to when you retire ? is it something you 're just going to realize one day or you 're going to plan ? do you think about it ?
you could play petra next . you have n't played in quite a long time . you guys had a really good match in istanbul a few years ago and a bunch of good matches before that . what do you think about possibly playing her for the first time in a long time and challenges that matchup presents you ?
she has n't played yet .
vika , seeing you at that sap presentation the other day , it seemed to me you were really growing into this spokesperson .
is it something you feel like , and is it something you try to do ?
vika , throughout your career , including juniors , who 's the one player that you enjoy playing against the most and why ?
growth in terms of ...
your match today , 61 first set , and then she really came on in the second set there . what was the difference between the two sets , and how were you ultimately able to solve her , prevail , whatever ?
vika , you have had some injuries since june . how did you feel out there today ? what was it like kind of dealing with those different problems from wimbledon on ?
victoria , i know at the end of that tiebreaker she had set point . were you still confident that you could still stay in that set ? you showed a lot of confidence out there today .
a lot of the guys have said that these are some of the quickest hard courts out there . how do you like the speed of these courts with respect to your game ?
do you feel it suits your game pretty well here , these conditions and courts ?
during your generation , there really have not been , i believe , any more classic serve and volleyers . do you have any theories on why that is , why that tactic , that style , has kind of disappeared both from men 's and women 's tennis ?
were there any coaches ever who tried to get you to be more of a serve and volleyer or that kind of just did n't exist anymore ?
victoria , kind of an offbeat question , but you 're going to be featured on a postage stamp here . can you just talk about that . did you have any input on that ? does that mean anything ? do you even know about it ?
you and max are going to have your own stamps in belarus .
could you talk about that a little bit . did you have any input into that ? was that special to you ?
victoria , i know you always have been very athletic and you put a lot in your fitness in the past years . lately , you have been getting to finals and it is more demanding on your body . this is a very important tournament so close to the us open . do you have to stop yourself not to overdo it sometimes ?
so that was a good third set you put together after a speed bump . you have to be happy with that , that you reversed the direction it was going .
how long does it take you to kind of get used to the changing conditions ? everybody talks about the balls in cincinnati kind of being more difficult to control and stuff compared to canada .
do you prefer the balls like you were using last week compared to this week ?
last year at this time you had a recent coaching change , and obviously you 've had a great 12 months since then . can you elaborate a little bit on the coaching tactics that you 've been able to implement that helped your game .
from making your way in the right direction up in standings , other than match experience , what would you say is the difference between you and the top 10 players at this point ?
how long did it take you to get comfortable playing against them , those big names ? was it something that you had to develop over a fair amount of time , or did you pretty much have the confidence ?
sloane , this is the first week ever that there 's no american guys in the top 20 .
since the rankings started in 1973. since the dawn of time .
1973 , so like 40 years ago . this is the first ever week there 's no americans in the top 20. so obviously you did n't know that .
what do you make of that stat ?
he 's 22 .
meanwhile , it 's been a really good stretch for american women . there 's a lot of you doing well . serena is obviously still doing well , jamie , madison . do you think there 's something working right that you can point out why the american women have been so successful ?
sloane , can you talk about the relationship to the fans and the players of the us open . last year you talked about them just being right there , wanting a piece of you , touching you , licking you .
what 's the range of those experiences ?
trying to get to you ?
have you talked to the wta at all about perhaps having a little more extra security for you around the grounds ?
or anywhere .
when you 're with the fans , are you just sort of trying to survive those moments or are you trying to actually engage with people ?
is it different than you thought it would be when you were coming up , the whole wanting the popularity side of it and that aspect ?
do you get that vocally too during your matches ? i remember one time melanie oudin was complaining like women from the crowds , like moms , would be shouting advice to her like during matches and things . do you get kind of that sort of connection with fans ?
sloane , you come from two very athletic parents . what do you think you 've gotten from each of them to kind of help you get to where you are now ? and do you think that gives you an advantage ?
before your father passed you were developing a relationship with him . what can you tell us about the time you spent with him ?
any advice on being a professional athlete ?
how would you cap the year going from here to the us open ? do you have some sort of grand plan in your mind how you 'd like to progress the rest of the year ?
the more successful you get , the more the fans are going to be right up on you too .
sloane , it sounds like last year you enjoyed that contact and this year you 're kind of bracing for it ; is that fair to say ?
and new york is ten times that .
one of the things that 's kind of disappeared from tennis is the serve and volley game . growing up , did you run into many true serve and volleyers ? do you see them out there ? if not , what happened ?
why do you suppose it 's disappeared ?
did people ever try to get you to serve and volley ?
how come ? you were n't comfortable with it ?
could you talk about your whole wimbledon experience , what you took away from that the most , please .
sloane , this year you have been playing so well in the us open and in australia you did very well , similar surface , but it 's in america . i know you talk about a lot of the pressure with the fans . how do you feel about it ? is that something have you had a dream like maybe winning the us open ? bartoli , she had a dream to win wimbledon . would the us open be like kind of a dream for you ? you 're on the top of your game . it 's a matter of time to have the trophy .
would not complain ?
sloane , do you take any extra notice when a couple players from like your generation face off against each other ? like i know later today monica puig and genie bouchard are playing each other . does that make your eyes light up when you see those kinds of matches ?
are you going to go get popcorn ?
no tv for that one .
one question : at the us open , if you had to walk out to one song , what would it be ?
congratulations . talk a little bit about the match today , that first set , and how you switched over .
and how are you feeling coming into this ? i 'm sure you 're thinking about last year , how your experience was in this tournament . is that factoring in at all even today ?
and for your summer , it was a little bit different too compared to your summer from last year . was there anything specific that sort of made a difference ?
how much did nerves come into play today ? you looked very much different than you did the rest of the tournament . are you surprised at that ?
what was it about the occasion of the final that made it sink in for you most ? getting flowers ? walking on court ?
you were quite emotional in the second set .
and then marion actually won the final game . do you think that will help you when you look back on it ?
in the fifth game of the second set you seemed to put your racquet to your face . there was a lot of pressure on you . you got very emotional . can you tell us what was running through your mind at that point ?
i felt like i wanted a bit more after it finished . you 'd been playing two weeks , and it comes down to about 90 minutes . do you think the threeset format is showing the best of women 's tennis ?
do you think there should be a fiveset final ?
what were your thoughts when marion put her arm on your shoulder as you were walking off ?
you said playing the threeset matches was draining and marion was fresher . did you feel less explosive , no rhythm on your serve ? can you explain how that translates ?
moving forward , how do you translate these results onto the hard courts ?
you talked about the hard draw you had . you get easier draws if you 're higher ranked . that 's a reflection throughout the year . to what extent can you motivate yourself for the tournaments that are n't on the centre court of wimbledon which make up a ranking because of the consistency ?
in the second set after you saved the match points , what did you do ? you emptied your mind of all the pressure ? you were a different player .
how disappointed were you that you just could n't get it ?
what do you admire most about marion ?
you brought up the word 'fun ' . i was curious how important that is , no matter what match . do you think about that at all ever or does it click or ...
can you learn from that as well for future grand slam finals ?
during the first set , are you pleading with yourself to stop being nervous ? how do you talk yourself out of being nervous ?
marion came back after a good number of years to win it . in your gut , do you think you can do that and emerge the champion here ?
looking back on this amazing and busy two weeks , which one is the happiest moment and which one is the toughest moment ?
how did the experience of having been in the final here six years affect today ?
how do you not get past the quarters in any tournament this year and win wimbledon ?
were you surprised how sabine handled the occasion ?
everyone in the future when they talk about you are going to say , wimbledon champion , marion bartoli . how much do you think it will change your life ?
i remember in january 2002 many people asked us to go on a court to watch a young girl .
returning the serve two meters back from the service line , and we thought you were crazy because nobody was doing that , trying to anticipate all the time . how many times you thought that your tactic , your strategy , all what you were doing , could look crazy , even if they were n't at the end ? your father was pushing you to do many different things than anybody else we have seen .
could you tell us about your father 's influence on your tennis and maybe even outside the court , what it meant for you to climb up there and hug him today .
you 've been around for many , many years . the circuit is so challenging . so many setbacks , yet you 've prevailed . talk more about doing things your way . is there a certain strength in that ? is it a challenge ?
you 've had experts on television demolishing the way you serve the ball . you were also booed by the crowd on court 1 when you wanted a rain delay . does it give you extra pride to think you 're a little bit different and you 've done it as someone who is a little bit different ? does it make it extra special for you that you 're different from the rest ?
generally you 're not afraid to state your opinions . you 're not afraid of what it might do to your popularity . if you want to stop for rain , you 're not afraid to say it . do you feel extra special that you 've come through that and won it and you 're a bit different ?
you said the other day about hitting rock bottom , and that 's going back to last summer when you missed the olympics . do those things make this even better ?
i know on espn this week they asked you to complete the fibonacci sequence .
what does the bartoli sequence look like ? how much further do you think you can go for the rest of your career ?
do you feel , having had this long journey , maybe not fitting the mold federations look for in young players , you can be a support for young girls ?
it was obviously a great match . i guess that 's no consolation to you .
at the end you left court very quickly . was that just because you were disappointed ?
sometimes you see people really congratulate the opponent after a match that 's as close as that .
where do you think the match turned for you ?
what do you think you 'll remember most about this tournament ?
you seemed to hold up okay physically in this match .
when serena went out , do you think all the players fancied their chances ?
are you going to hang around and watch jerzy tomorrow ?
is the disappointment because the match was so close and it 's just a tough loss , or is it kind of the lost opportunity of what could have happened if you won this match with marion in the final ?
is your plan now to go back to poland and rest , and what does your summer hard court season look like ?
your feelings right now .
i think you were nine when steffi played her last wimbledon final . do you remember that day , and what does it feel like for you to be in the final ?
did she call you or send you an email ?
how does it feel to be the first german to reach the final since steffi ?
a lot of people are comparing this match to your match with serena with the scorelines being similar . is there a way to compare the two ?
it was such a thriller in the third set that even the electronic scoreboard had a heart attack . are things like these just out of your scope ? how did you regain your focus in the third set and pull through ?
what happened in the second set ?
and that 's it ?
did that help you going off for a break ?
now that you 're into the final , if you become the wimbledon champion , what will that mean for your career and life ?
on saturday you will face a different type of opponent . what sort of match do you expect with marion ?
how do your styles compare ?
the handshake at the end was n't particularly warm . it was a great match , and it went very , very quickly , the handshake . were you at all concerned by that ?
when you first made the quarters here in '09 , i think a lot of people were getting excited about your game , the big serve and stuff . do you feel like making the final now , four years later , is faster than expected ? did you think it would come sooner ?
can you talk about the dream of winning wimbledon ? did it happen after four hours of practice ? after a junior win ? when you were watching wimbledon as a child ? can you recall ?
do you remember a court or a player ?
how many autographs do you think you have given after the match ?
how do you like the atmosphere , the fans at wimbledon ? what does it mean to you ?
do you believe in destiny ? do you think there 's some sort of destined run here ? the draw has broken open , but you 've actually had a tough draw regardless .
you 've talked about the inspiration you drew from the time you were recovering after indian wells and how that 's given ou confidence and belief . at the time , did you ever believe that you could be at a level like this ?
what was your most fervent dream ?
what you have achieved so far , i think a lot of people believe it 's very inspiring . can you share with us , when you feel very down , in a difficult time , what makes you keep going , make you stronger ?
you 're so popular in this country . are you more popular in england than you are in germany , do you think ?
can you tell us who has inspired you ?
have you met either of them ?
we 're all fascinated that you 're able to sleep before a semifinal match . can you explain why you need to sleep , why it 's important so close to the game .
did you set your alarm ?
what will you do before the final ?
is there a place you can sleep in the dressing room ? a couch ?
you talked the other day about having weird motivations . did you have any weird motivations today that you can share with us ?
how does this time in the final feel different than the last time ?
will it feel different playing against lisicki or radwanska as opposed to playing against venus , who won the tournament three or four times already ?
what do you consider the biggest differences in the way you play and the way you think from that time six years ago until now ?
how about your happiness on the court ?
we 're all writers here , but you like to paint for yourself . if you had to paint a picture of your incredible run to this final , would it be impressionistic ? abstract ? realistic ? van gogh ? picasso ?
a little monet , or not really ?
fans say they enjoy the routine you do between points . do you always do the same thing ? do you have a routine you work through ?
given that it was your most difficult season ever , certainly on court , maybe a little bit off court , you 're not a tiny bit amazed you made it to this stage ?
did you feel it was inevitable you would get back to a grand slam final ?
you say you turn your back so as to not disturb your opponent . have you ever turned around to find a ball coming straight towards you ?
how has it been making this run without your dad here ?
are you having more fun or do you think fun was missing before ?
there 's also an element of intimidation involved in whacking your racquet in the air , running to the chair in between games ?
you said you felt you deserved to be in another grand slam final . could you explain why you felt that way .
were you in agreement that a rain break was appropriate when it happened ? how do you think that extended delay affected you , if at all ?
you had some great moments in your return games in the second set , but serving was problematic . talk about that . she returns pretty well .
seemed like experience was a big difference today . here you were off and on , off and on , which she has done for a lot more years . is that something you think you 'll know for next time ?
going back to that crucial game on your serve when there was the rain delay , would you have liked to have finished that particular game or did you think you had to go off there and then ?
someone was saying you had a bit of bad luck , similar circumstances at the australian open . there was an interruption there as well , was n't there ?
there are players who say that playing her , not only for her game , also her quirkiness , are a distraction , hard to get out of your mind or not see . how do you feel about that ?
has there ever been a match where you had a break like that at such a crucial time ?
you had a fabulous run over really quite a long period , great wins . you also said a player has to find their rhythm . do you think in the bigger picture of your career you have to find a certain rhythm with more consistency , a little less ups and downs , or do n't you think that 's a factor ?
do you think you can win this tournament pretty soon ?
can you elaborate on where that is that you do want to get and also what specifically you think it will take to be at that level ?
was is your overall feeling coming off court ?
when you were coming back from the break , did you know you were n't feeling good or was it when play started you realized that it was n't the rhythm you like ?
how do you feel you competed in this match compared to other matches in this tournament ?
you had a huge share of the crowd support today . why do you think that is and how much did that boost you today ?
only your second tournament on grass . talk about the surface and learning and how you feel about it now .
do you leave here more excited about reaching a quarterfinal here for the first time , the wins that led to that , or disappointed in the way things went today ?
when you 're devising a game plan before a match , who do you do it with ?
just to be clear , was there gamesmanship involved with bartoli calling for that rain delay ?
a number of americans did real well here , young americans . you 're really the leader of the young generation in a certain way . does that give you a certain pride ? talk about that position .
it sounds like as opposed to australia or roland garros , that you actually expected to win today ; is that true ?
yesterday you said that it has been a crazy wimbledon . now that you 're leaving , what do you think the biggest lessons are for you about what took place in your matches and overall here ?
did you fall at all during last week when everybody else was falling ? did you have a spill ?
my question is : because of that context , all the spills , do you understand that she was bothered by the rain , perhaps worried about it , or at this point it 's not nearly the concern ?
was there anything about competing at wimbledon in the main draw that you especially enjoyed or thought was special or different , whether it 's the courts or the crowds or the locker room , something we might see or might not see , that is special from your point of view ?
big american stretch coming up for you . you 're playing teamtennis , then d.c. , canada , cincy , us open . there will be a lot of attention and focus on you there . what are you expecting from all that ?
you said you warmed up a few times in the gym before going back out . were you told once , twice , hey , it 's about to resume ?
on tv ?
you had some tough battles against her in the past . how proud are you of winning this one ?
how is your injury ?
what are your thoughts on your style of play versus sabine 's and what the match will depend on ?
how would you describe the differences in your styles of play ?
how did you see your opponent li na 's performance today ? she had changes today .
her style .
i think you 've said before that when serena is playing her best , she maybe is the one player that no one can beat . so when you found out she was out of the draw yesterday , i guess it opened it up pretty much for everyone , no ?
but for you , you reached the final last year . you were talking about maybe defending that , a little bit of pressure . it gives you a great opportunity now to move through all the way .
last year when you went all the way through to the final it was a new experience . does that make it easier this time around now that you 've been through it all ?
did you feel extra pressure today because of your grand slam quarterfinal record ?
you almost missed the final last year because you were ill. how worried are you that this injury you have might prevent you from playing the next match and the final , if you get there ?
how much pain would it take for you to give it up ?
you move very easy on grass . you never slip , while the other players , they are slipping and having lots of problems with that particular surface . did that come to you naturally , or you also struggled and had to work specifically ?
janowicz said the other day that polish tennis really started with you . can you talk about the effect you 've had on tennis in your country and how things have changed since you came up .
do you have any explanation for so many players suddenly coming through ?
yes .
you mentioned what a big thing it is for poland . could you give us a little bit of scouting report of what you expect tomorrow , and also what you expect to be happening at home ?
can you talk about your memories of lisicki from the juniors . did she hang around with you and caroline and your sisters ? did you play her when you were really little ?
so who won ?
you mentioned that the men 's quarterfinal , the allpolish quarterfinal , that match is going to be very big for your country . can you describe what type of people both those guys are and what type of players they are .
what kind of guys are they ?
who is your biggest rival in your mind in wimbledon ? is it li na or serena or somebody else ?
have you ever talked or trained with martina hingis ? was her name ever mentioned in your family when you grew up ?
you must be very happy with the way you got through that .
this win was really emotional .
the effect of beating serena yesterday , was it a liberating experience ? did you feel perhaps you could do anything having done that , that pressure ?
i was talking about the effect of serena , beating serena . did that have any , not pressure , but did it make you feel that perhaps anything was possible ?
what will you take from your last semifinal here in terms of experience to help you in the next one ?
what was that like last time ? was it overwhelming ? difficult to deal with ?
why do you feel more prepared ? what is it that makes you feel better ?
you can try .
we do n't yet know who your opponent will be in the next round . could you take each one of the two possibilities and describe the challenge of facing each one of them .
would you elaborate on that ? what do you remember most about the match against li na ?
two british newspapers today have printed a picture of you on the front page and not andy murray . everybody is crazy about the laughing girl from germany . everyone is asking , how do you stay so positive with such a great attitude in such a competitive game like tennis ? what is your secret ? what is your recipe ?
do you let yourself think about maybe winning the whole tournament now or are you still taking it match by match ?
this is a question i should have asked yesterday . serena said she felt like you were reading her serve . today you also played against a player who has a huge serve and you managed to read it really well . do you think you have an ability of reading serves ?
great support yesterday and today . is that a british tshirt you 're wearing ?
are you the british fans ' favorite now ?
how different were you feeling walking into the court today than yesterday ?
you mentioned the difficult period of recovery that you had in your life . how does that inspire you ?
did you have any trouble today with your opponent ?
steffi graf is the most famous german player . does it help to have an example like that or is it more of a burden ?
it was less than 24 hours from the end of your match yesterday to the beginning of your match today . you talked about mentally how you flipped . what were those less than 24 hours like ? what were you doing ?
you seem to be playing with such joy . you spoke about your love of the game . what is it that you love about tennis ?
what center courts have you played on that are special memories for you ?
you seemed to be having problems with your breathing . seemed to be perspiring a lot . do you have a touch of flu or something ?
did it affect your stamina ?
when did that start ? did you feel badly when you woke up today or previously ?
4all in the last set , do you think maybe it was an issue of not winning as many matches as you had here before when you won this tournament , the confidence ?
did playing under the roof make it any worse ?
do you feel it was bad luck because you got sick before so you are going to forget this easily , or is it a tough loss for you because there was a big opportunity ?
you 've been in a bunch of slam quarterfinals . did this one feel different because of the other players who were n't here ?
what were you doing particularly well in this tournament that you can kind of use as momentum as we get over to the states , which i know you do n't love playing in , but it 's a reality ?
are you planning to go back to czech and have a rest and training block or ...
illness aside today , where would you say your level is now today compared to when you won here two years ago ?
going into the quarterfinal today , did it feel different at all than the quarterfinal in 2011 ?
pironkova .
but looking back then , did you feel like you were going into that match with less to lose than maybe today ?
is kirsten playing well enough to perhaps go on and win the whole thing ?
all the media are being asked who do we think are going to win . we do n't have any idea .
can you make any sense of what 's happened to this tournament ? can you explain all these strange results that have happened ?
quarterfinals at wimbledon is a great achievement . do you think this is also a turning point , like going back to the old kaia kanepi who has been so successful at grand slam tournaments in the past ?
what are your personal goals for the rest of the season after this ?
how did you feel you played today ? you played yesterday , as well . was that difficult for you ?
( question regarding clay court . )
what are your plans now when you finish here ?
will you be at the us open ?
do you think you might have had a little bit too much respect for lisicki after her beating serena ? was it an invisible wall ?
were you surprised by the crowd booing you because you complained about the weather ?
it made tennis difficult for you in the second set because the crowd were very much behind stephens .
was that something you had to learn to do , learn to deal with crazy conditions , strange things , and just focus ? have you always been good at that , or is that something you developed over time ?
she 's young . she 's just getting into these situations . could you feel her fraying , or do you not notice what is going on over there and just worry about the ball and you ?
your returning has always been the strength of your game . you won 16 of the first 17 points of the second set on her serve . have you ever felt that in a zone ? what was going on there ?
have you ever played a match before with eight consecutive breaks of serve ?
you were n't 100 % at the french open ; you withdrew from birmingham ; you pulled out of eastbourne with a virus . are you surprised to find yourself back into the semifinals after everything that you had to go through over the course of the last month ?
back when you were making your great run to the final and you had your win over justine , you told us then that you looked up and there was pierce brosnan cheering you on . you said , if he 's here , i have to play better . what would be the one celebrity you would like to be here for your semi ?
is it sometimes a distraction ?
could you offer us an explanation into why you think you lost the match .
you looked a little nervy have at the end . towards the end of the match it looked like you were a little tight . talk about that .
i know you 've always said you come in here you 're taking each game as it comes . everyone else has been pretty much handing you the trophy almost before the tournament began . did that at all get to you ?
has it been tough not having your dad here for the first time ?
he 's obviously a massive support for you with coaching .
is there something you think might have caused the sort of tightness or hesitation on the big points today ? definitely uncharacteristic .
have you heard from venus yet ?
one of the best parts of your serve is the ability to disguise it well . lisicki seemed to be able to read it .
you 've barely lost in the last 12 months . how much of a shock is this to you ?
how did you feel and what was your mindset in the first set ? she seemed to just go for broke . was the result of that set more a function of her high stakes or a slower start by you ?
what were you saying to yourself at the end of the first set ?
if you could change anything in the game mentally or physically , what would you go back and want to change ?
at the corporate luncheon , annabel croft made some unflattering remarks about your physique . did that bother you or anything ?
you were so dominant in the second set , how come you could n't get that through to the third one ?
you were saying about getting to the third set that that 's what you always want to do . you had gotten up 3love there . what in your mind started happening at that point ? what was going through your head ?
a lot of players go out there with nothing to lose against you . when is the last time you felt like you had nothing to lose on court ?
any views on how you see who is going to get your title now , and what do you plan to do the rest of the week ?
obviously you know in the tennis world this is going to be big news , it 's titanic . in your world , is it as big a deal ? is it going to be tough to get over or have you learned how to handle a loss like this ?
lisicki has had a lot more success here than any of the other grand slam tournaments . do you mind explaining a little bit about why she has success , why her game works on this surface .
you 've lost at wimbledon before . given the shape of the draw , the opportunity that was there this year , is this your most disappointing exit to date ?
but you said that you were n't willing or able to hold your serve and probably did n't want to hold it .
you 've been in europe for a while . what is your general takeaway after the french open , the leadup to the clay , now this ?
with the annabel croft comments , do you feel you were targeted in that way because you are a woman ? are women more judged about the way they look than men are ?
all of us have a bad day at the office . what is it like for a tennis player to have to come in to a tournament seven times , day after day , to be at their peak , never to have an off day ?
but this was an off day for you ?
i ca n't be sure , but i think it 's been one of the first times you 've been at a grand slam without your mom , dad , venus being here . is it different , strange , or no effect ?
what is your reaction to serena williams ' wish that you should win here this year ?
third set you played by far your best set of the tournament . do you feel the same way ?
is there a reason why you have n't been going for your shots thus far in the tournament ?
we 've seen players today just burst into tears upon winning , collapse on the court , dramatics . you were so very composed . could you tell us what was going on inside , what your emotions were about moving on ?
what do you think you 've learned about yourself and your game in getting to this point ?
what are you most proud that you 've achieved so far to get here ?
just the last couple of days .
when you were talking about learning how to fight till the end , were you talking about wimbledon or in the last year or two ?
has that been an issue in your career ?
you played pretty well the last three tournaments after a streak where you were n't playing your best . how do you stop the bleeding and turn it around mentally ?
was there a point in the spring when you thought you were n't that good anymore ?
what is your take on serena being out this early ?
do you see yourself going all the way to the finals ?
you said you were a 20yearold , you can do whatever you want to do . what do you want to do ?
what is the show ?
what is it about ?
marion bartoli . can you describe your thoughts about the challenge in the next round .
what about the styles ? can you describe her style versus yours ?
you spoke at the french open about that being your favorite tournament . wondering what success at wimbledon means to you as a tennis player and maybe what memories you might even have of watching wimbledon as a kid .
2005 .
how much did it help to cut back some of the other distractions that have sort of taken over your life since australia ?
you 've had such consistent , impressive results in these recent slams . do you consider yourself a bigmatch player ? is there anything about the stakes and the setting that affects you in a positive way ?
do the stakes feel any different for you coming into this quarterfinals than when you made the quarterfinals in australia ? does this feel like more of an opportunity ?
in terms of how you measure your success for the rest of the way , are you going to be tougher on yourself this time ?
growing up watching this tournament , you talked about the quarterfinals , maybe semifinals , how much of your task is dealing with the occasion as well as the opponent from here on in ?
centre is different ?
you could be .
let 's say you go back to your place and your phone is ringing , you pick up and it 's mrs.neumeier . she says , tell me about your fortnight at wimbledon . what do you say ?
you always seem so refreshingly honest in interviews . is that the way you are in your life ? how would you describe your personality to new fans ?
what would your mom say about you ?
serena says she thinks you have a really good chance to win the title . talk about that .
what are your thoughts on your performance today ?
how difficult was it to get yourself up for the second set having narrowly lost the tiebreak ?
what will you take out of this whole sort of nine days , what have you learnt from it ?
how much did the pressure get to you ? was it a big factor for you ?
do you think in a couple of days you might look back and think actually it was a really good wimbledon for you , a step up , better than you 've done before ?
how would you describe the crowd today ?
us open you may well be seeded now . is your intention for all future wimbledons to be in the top 32 , a seed , and have a better chance ?
( indiscernible . )
you talked about her power . anything you think you can do in the future to address that ? because there 's just going to be powerful players on tour .
i think a lot of people were getting excited at the prospect of you facing serena in the quarters . serena going out , does that show the depth in the women 's game ?
is that part of the disappointment , the fact that serena is out , and she was in your part of the draw , it opened up a little bit for you to go on and get to the final ?
a lot of women , young girls , came to watch you particularly . do you remember watching someone when you were young thinking that 's who you would like to be in tennis ?
do you think it was unrealistic of people who made you the favorite , given her experience ?
there 's been huge support for you from across the country . david cameron sent a tweet from kazakhstan wishing you luck today . has that helped you , or do those messages put extra pressure on you ?
what do you think of kanepi 's chances against lisicki ?
you said you were struggling to come up with a signoff as you left the court , a wave , blowing kisses . today there was nothing when you left the court . why was that ?
obviously you 're a work in progress . what kind of aspects of your game are you going to go away and work on between now and the us open ?
does this feel much more deflating than going out at the same stage of the us open last season ? if so , do you think that 's because of the increased expectations you 've now put on yourself ?
you 're the highest seed left . is it yours to win ?
why do you think that 's happened this year ?
given the results on the men 's side today , it 's a very big day for polish tennis . i wondered if you could tell us a little bit about your feelings .
do you have any plans to do anything together ?
do you feel any extra pressure being the highest seed left ?
li na up next . what do you know about her ?
how did you manage to control your emotions ? it seemed to be almost all too much for you .
am i right you said 'thank you ' to her as you shook hands ?
may i ask what she said ?
do you feel yourself better in wimbledon than anywhere else ?
how does it feel to come here time after time and beat the reigning french open champion ?
why do you always destroy the winner of the french open ?
when you knew you were playing serena , you knew you were playing the best player in the world . did something in your mind say , she won the french , maybe i can do it again ?
you clearly enjoyed playing with the pressure off today . your win means bookmakers have you as the favorite to take the championship . does that affect you in any way ?
not even a little bit ?
did you notice anything different at all in serena 's play ?
did you lose faith at all during that stretch in which she won those games in a row ? you were down 3love in the third set .
how were you able to ?
when you were a girl growing up , was it your dream to win wimbledon ?
or was it becoming world no.1 ?
in your previous matches against her , did you have the same mental attitude or did you come in with a different attitude determined to win this ? did you go into all three exactly the same ?
what i mean is , the first two times you played serena , did you have a different attitude playing her today ?
do you think serena will come back as strong next year ?
how do you think it will affect her , this loss ?
to what extent can you add this to the polish success of today , considering your roots ?
your next opponent is kaia kanepi . what do you think about her ?
she also beat kerber .
( question about coming back after a big win . )
you clearly were n't fazed playing serena . with that sort of attitude , you 're relishing rather than having any nerves about it ?
i believe you 're heading out to play doubles this evening . is that right ?
how will you come physically and mentally back on tomorrow ?
can you explain what you will do to make sure that does n't happen ?
why have you been so much more successful here than at any of the other grand slam tournaments ? how much of that is even a mental thing of coming in here knowing that you 've had success here in the past or more just purely that your game works well on the grass better than other surfaces ?
it was n't an easy one , but getting to the quarters after a bit of a struggle is satisfying ?
do you take confidence that you 're battling through these matches ?
you will still be the big favorite in the next match . do you think you will be as nervous as today ?
is it surprising for you to see the other players left in your half of the draw ?
what do you want to improve in your game at the moment ?
how much do you think about the trophy you won here in 2011 ?
is it any pressure to see the draw , your part of the draw , thinking it 's a good shot ?
you 're five times champion here . were you annoyed having to wait all day to play and being shifted around to a different court ?
the scoreline was emphatic , but she made you work quite hard at times . does it make you wonder if you can play into your 40s ?
you 've played probably more night matches under the lights at the us open than any other active player . how did you find your first one at wimbledon ? how would you compare the two ?
how did you find the atmosphere ?
you were talking about your opponent 's fitness . do you notice a difference in how hard it is to stay fit now compared to 10 years ago or is it about the same ?
did you get any tips from venus ?
could you give me some examples ?
how much time do you spend in recovery now versus other years ?
you do n't do ice baths or anything like that ?
ever ?
how would you describe where you are in your game right now , what you 're most pleased with and maybe , if anything , what you 're not pleased with ?
what about the matchup with sabine ?
what do you think you 'll be doing at 42 ?
some different folks that we have n't seen a lot in the fourth round , like monica puig , laura robson , sloane stephens . your thoughts on how things have shaped out a little differently than maybe anticipated ?
i think kimiko hit on the right so fast . what impression did you have of kimiko today ?
laura robson is into the second week for the first time here . given the home crowd , do you think she 's somebody that people might start to fear the longer the tournament goes on ?
if you had any thoughts for the younger americans in this phase , sort of the rookie phase of their careers , what suggestions would you have ?
you spoke earlier of being very happy where you are in terms of feeling well physically . in terms of the middle of wimbledon , compared to all the other times you 've played here , what is your degree of satisfaction of how you 're positioned for week two ?
what 's the comparison between this one and the previous ?
what is the first thing that comes to mind when you hear 600 wins ?
500 ? 100 matches ago .
what are your thoughts on the wimbledon policy year in , year out of always putting more men 's matches on the big courts than women ?
are you aware that you were the marquee match today on court1 ? they put you there because you 're the star .
it 's been so long that you 've lost a match . do you have to remember losses to keep yourself motivated ?
of the 600 , the most magical matches , wonderful , really close to your heart ?
how did you see that then ? disappointing obviously .
given how well you 've been playing you must be disappointed . did some part of you fancy getting into the next round ?
you 'll probably disagree with this . you talked earlier in the tournament about how you were making yourself play more aggressively on grass . it looked like today sometimes you were almost having to force yourself to attack and get to the net .
has this weekend and the last week changed your outlook on the grass ? next season will you look forward to it more next year ?
is that the first time you played centre court here ?
how much are you looking forward to obviously having a bit of a break and focusing on the us open now ?
do you see bernard tomic socially ?
will you make a point before you go of perhaps passing on best wishes ?
there was a rough match in the middle there . lost eight straight games . you survived . how did you pull yourself out of that ?
what was the decision like to stop like last night and what was it like having to sleep on just losing a set 60 and having to reset ?
was that second set solely to the fact you could n't see ?
how much of today was about survival ? did n't look like you had your a game .
you felt pressure because it was immediate ?
how many times have you done that in your career where you 've had to come back and play ? countless ? very small number ?
do you sleep well on a night like that ?
second week of all three slams so far this year . talk about that consistency , what that brings to your game .
how well do you know monica ? she lives mostly in miami , and you 've live in south florida a lot .
and that 's saviano 's ?
what did nick bring ? what 's his special ability that he brings to player development ?
are you glad you went there ?
you never played her in juniors , monica , did you ?
did you play a lot at the academy , practice sets ?
can you describe a little bit about her game , her personality .
but on court , too .
when your opponent doublefaults three times in one game as she did today , is it hard for you to concentrate at all ?
what goes through your mind when you hear some people projecting a week from now the possibility , even the possibility , that you could be facing serena williams for the title ?
what feeling does that give you when people think of you with that regard ?
you had a tough firstround match . has the rest of the tournament felt like sort of getting the job done every round to you ? like you had a little bit of a letdown after the first round ?
is there pressure for you when you 're playing someone in the next round who you 're older than ?
yeah . she 's 19 .
after the second set yesterday , did you appeal to the umpire ?
last night after you were done , were you angry at yourself for losing that set 60 or were you angry they kept playing in the dark ?
with you and madison and serena all on court deep into the first week at arguably the world 's most important tournament , some people would say , that 's pretty significant that there are three african americans playing . in the past you 've been fairly nonchalant about such things . do you think it is significant or not really ?
in a way , just because it does n't matter , do you think that sort of says something ?
do you know alison riske at all ?
how well do you know monica off court ? in here she 's been very confident . seems like she has a big personality .
she said the other day that all of you know each other , but that does n't mean that you talk that much or are besties . is that common on the tour amongst the younger set ?
that 's it ?
i know you 're close to mallory . are there other players that you keep in touch with ?
match of two halves . how can you explain the turnaround ?
were you concerned the game was going to run away from you , such a big occasion ?
how much did the backing from the fans help you , do you think ?
what are your emotions on reaching the second week ?
did the guy at the end get you to do something on his ipad , get an autograph ?
how much do you have left to improve ? do you think you 're hitting your peak or can you go on and play better ?
obviously you 're 19 and have a long career ahead of you . how important is it to get some of these big , deep runs at this stage of your career and win while you 're young ?
is there any comedown now from being on centre to being moved down to court 2 ?
there was a distinct momentum change . was there one specific point where you thought the game changed around ? could you see her tightening up when she was serving for the match ?
has your mum been in touch ? any chance of her coming over from greece for the second week ?
andy murray said in his documentary that he admitted freely he was very boring . do you ever manage any life outside of tennis ? or is this it now at 19 ?
a lot of your predecessors would have crumbled at that point mentally . i wondered how you coped with that out there .
but at the point in the second set when she looked like to be heading , how do you ...
what do you think of harry styles tweeting you ? are you going to tweet him back ?
with your australian grandparents , have they been communicating with you at all either before your game or since your victory ?
you told me at eastbourne that your idea of a good night in , relaxing away from tennis right now is watching hannibal . there was a killer instinct you went for her in the third set .
can you give us some insight into what you do in the evenings to put tennis out of your mind ? are you watching violent television ?
a lot of stats will come out about the first time since '98 we had a british man and woman through to the second week . this will put you up into the top 30 since jo durie in '87 . are you aware of these landmarks ? does that take care of itself as you go through the tournament ?
we 've seen you rising up the rankings . is that not something that ...
i wanted to ask about your next match against kanepi or alison riske .
just started . talk about each of them briefly .
tough match today . must be pleased to have come through that ?
a lot of people are tipping her to do great things . only 18. you see a bit of yourself in her ?
how long did it take for you when you played madison to kind of figure out exactly what you wanted to do against her ? what do you think you did particularly well today ?
how do you feel your form is heading towards what would be a semifinal with serena if you both get there ?
polish players have been doing well in this tournament . jerzy was in here yesterday saying you helped bring polish tennis to prominence . what do you think of how your countrymen are doing ?
are you happy to share the spotlight with more polish players ?
i used to travel the world of table tennis with andrezej grubba . do you know him ?
i was going to ask you how the people in poland feel about you ? do the people in poland know about you ?
do you drive a lexus ?
you played madison now . you also played laura robson weeks ago . can you rate both of them ? what is your take on their games and how they compare ?
it says in the notes how much you enjoy smiling . you clearly enjoyed that game .
you 've obviously had a couple of difficult years with injuries , illnesses . are you fully fit , raring to go now ?
which would be a good feeling for you ?
presumably gives you a lot of confidence to feel so good physically ?
what has it been like going through the different injuries ?
do you think that now is a key thing in your mind to take you forward ?
next up could well be serena . a couple weeks ago we were talking about her , you were saying on your day you can serve as hard as her , she 's not unbeatable . what do you say today ?
you feel you 're serving as hard as she does , even here ?
i do n't know . were you close to your best already today ?
will you watch the match that 's later today between the two women ?
if you do face williams , what do you think would be the key to that match ?
everybody is describing here as the nailedon favorite . do you think that 's a little bit dangerous ?
the fact that everybody seems to have written off almost everybody else and almost called her the winner already .
why do you like that ?
that allows you to play a different way than if you 're favored over someone ?
what was the difference between yesterday and today ?
no problem with the grass ?
how important was that win mentally for you ?
do you think you will ?
when was the last time you felt that you were playing the kind of tennis that you wanted to play , that you felt you were playing really well in a particular tournament ?
where do you feel your game is compared to two years ago ?
do you feel if you can erase these inconsistencies you can challenge again ?
what do you think about your next opponent ?
you 're not thinking about what 's next after suarez ?
we know you 're a very private person . there 's some stuff floating around now about your private life . is that something that 's difficult to cope with , or have you been dealing with it okay ?
what is the most important thing for you as you go along in the rest of the tournament if you 're going to be successful ?
you say sometimes in your matches you 're a little bit up and down . why do you think that is ? do you think there 's something you can do to work on that to avoid the peaks in the matches ?
looking back to last year , was it difficult being the defending champion ? is it a little bit easier this year because you 're not ?
you said it 's hard to keep your level during every match . do you feel tired ?
she 's crafty ; she 's cool ; she gets a lot of balls back . you were right in there and much closer obviously than miami . how did you feel about it ?
she was impressed with your serving .
you had a lot of aces there .
where do you think the match turned ultimately ?
did you still feel hopeful at that point ?
was there any point during the match where you were like , wow , i 'm hanging in there ; i 'm right there with her ; i 'm not getting blown off the court like in miami ?
it 's been a lot of progress the first six months of the year . must be pretty pleased going into the summer . can you sort of the take a moment to assess your season so far ?
what were you thinking when you 're serving at i think love40 and you come back to stay in the match , what are you thinking at that point with those match points against you ?
did you have three aces in a row ?
can you imagine someday lifting the trophy at this tournament on the final saturday ?
do you think you can do it in the next four or five years maybe ?
you 're on a sharp upward track . i think you 're into the top 50 with this thirdround run here . seeding at the us open does n't seem completely impossible . what are your shortterm goals ? if longterm is to win a big title , what 's the rest of 2013 ?
do you attribute lack of experience versus her experience to the close of that match ?
did you learn anything about chancetaking in a match like that , at the end of a match like that , from this match ?
what do you learn about yourself and your game in match like this ?
during this whole european swing , what 's the coolest message you 've gotten from someone ?
that 's because you 're not on twitter .
what about going forward on your second serve ? did you envision doing that more often ?
you 've been doing this for a while now . what 's kind of your thoughts on the lifestyle ? it 's obviously not what most people do .
what 's your schedule for the rest of the year ?
so nothing about like the travel and the hotels is a grind yet ?
we tend to lump all the young americans into kind of one big group . do you feel like you guys continue to close the gap between you and serena , say ?
you have such great weapons , such a big upside . some have even said that by the time wimbledon comes around next year you might even be a top 10. is that something you can imagine in the immediate future ?
after this are you going to take some time off before you go to stanford , or is it a training block or hitting the courts ?
do you like the training , or would you rather play tournaments ?
have you been to northern california ?
how do you feel to get through ? must be delighted .
how do you think your form is in this tournament ? do you think you 're playing at your best level now ?
obviously you got far here three years ago . how much do you think your game has improved since then ?
you 've made it to the quarterfinals of three different grand slams in your career already . back in the second week of a grand slam again , does it feel like something scary or something you 're used to ?
you 're definitely going to get that in the next round against laura robson .
all the attention is going to be okay for you ?
do you like that , though ?
talk about your comeback , your latest injury . you 've been out a few times in your career . talk about the latest one especially .
are you fully recovered now ?
in the matches themselves , it does n't bother you ?
just afterwards ?
do you feel like you 're moving better than before in your career ?
is that a new emphasis for you , fitness ?
what do you know about laura and her game ? what sort of challenges will she present to you ?
have you watched many of her matches this week ?
have you seen her around on the tour and watched her play ?
you like playing british players , do n't you ?
you beat heather watson in paris and tara moore here .
you 're good against british players .
where do you see yourself fitting on the tour for now ? do you think you have it in you to win a grand slam soon ? is it possible for you ?
does that feel like that 's something you 're close to being able to do ?
are you aware of how much hysteria there is around laura robson , how the country is going crazy , that you 'll be at the center of this on monday ?
do you think it might affect you in some way on monday ?
are you a one direction fan at all ?
the band .
you mentioned the other day your mum was n't able to watch you . did she come ?
can you tell us how different it is playing under the roof , the conditions and also the atmosphere with the crowd behind you ?
how pleased were you with the way you dealt with your nerves ?
were you surprised that you did n't actually get on last night when the roof was closed ?
you have doubles , as well . are you comfortable with the workload of going well in the singles and doubles matches ? will there come a time when you have to consider whether one takes priority ?
did your mum send you any texts on today 's game ?
the affection , the enthusiasm for you from the crowd is becoming very strong . there are various experts that say that does impose extraordinary levels of pressure . is it something you have to deal with , this feeling that when you go out , especially wimbledon , the centre court , you 're going to deal with a huge amount of expectation ? is this something you think you might have to deal with sooner or later ?
obviously it 's been a big week for you , but you 've also gotten voice support from 60 % of one direction over twitter . is that something that gives you a heart attack when you see it during this week , or is it just part of what makes playing in england beautiful ?
are you worried at all that the other two are n't quite on the boy bandwagon yet ?
do you feel you 're playing as well as you were last year at the us open ?
yesterday serena williams was asked if you could make the top 10. she said even higher than that . are you flattered by that ? is that what you 're looking to achieve longterm ?
can you tell us something about how difficult it is nowadays to break through as a really young player ?
going into any tournament , how do you measure yourself ? do you say , i will get to the quarterfinals ? i 'll go to the finals ? how do you measure yourself ?
obviously during a tournament you have to take each game as it comes . when you 're putting in the hard hours on the practice courts , what motivates you to go that extra mile ? do you want to be in the top 10 , no.1 , win a grand slam ? what is your tennis dream you 're following here ?
what was today ?
whenever you google your name , your name comes up next to an australian flag .
can you talk about your connections to australia .
do you actually like one direction , or do you prefer a different kind of music ? if so , what ?
you just said obviously serena was the best player of all time . how would you compare her with martina and with steffi ?
serena being talked about being the best of all time , she 's been challenged to a match by andy murray . are you interested in seeing how that one might go if they get it on in vegas ?
do you have any techniques for coping with the pressure on you ? you 're playing no.71 tomorrow . at 38 , you should be regarded as the winner of that match . do you have any specific techniques for coping with the pressure ?
the prime minister tweeted you the other day , congratulating you on your performance . how did that go down ? how does that sort of reflect on the fact that everyone is watching you ? how can you cut that out and concentrate on your game ?
you said you had no expectations coming into the tournament . has that changed now looking forward , ambitions going forward from here ?
could i rephrase the question . serena and andy , he challenged her . she said , maybe . would that be something that you as players and as friends might be interested in seeing ?
there 's a possibility that you could play eugenie bouchard . have you two discussed it and what was said ?
great win , huh ?
third set was really tough . last game was very long . you did n't seem to get nervous and kind of clutched it out at the end . maybe you were nervous .
that one return that you missed by , i do n't know , an inch or two , and the crowd screamed prematurely . that made you laugh , right ?
when you were imagining you were n't at wimbledon was it at birmingham , or what was it ?
what is it that you feel in your game on grass that is different than what you feel on other surfaces ? because the results obviously grass is in a league of its own for you .
so mostly moving forward , that helps you most , do you think ?
so you train at junior champions tennis center ?
talk about that . what 's cool there ? there are a lot of different people , coaches . what appeals to you ?
you went into this match with a losing record against her . did you change anything you were playing her forehand a lot or was it just you played better on the big points ?
i thought you lost the last time .
so what did you switch up today ? what was really the key for you ?
has seeing some of the other americans around your age having success , is that contagious ? what are your thoughts on that ?
who did you know the best among the americans ?
how far back do you and melanie go ?
what was that like ?
did you sell that ? shelby was complaining she was still paying rent .
what goes through your mind when you watch serena williams ?
so what degree do you model your game , if at all , after her or any other players who you 've seen ?
when melanie reached us open quarters , do you remember that ?
what were you doing at the time and what were you thinking ?
were you surprised ? i think you were 17 then and you were basically out of juniors . you maybe still were playing juniors , no ?
did it kind of inspire you to say , here is my really good friend from juniors . if she 's doing that , maybe it 'll be me ?
there are a lot of young players with the usta . talk about your coaching situation . do you work out at the champions center , too ? talk about that .
geoff macdonald at vanderbilt said he 's extremely pleased what the you did today . i wanted you to know that .
in view of all this , do you have any regrets not playing college tennis ?
i think you 're the fourth , if i 'm counting right , american woman into the third round in this tournament . first time on the men 's side no one is in the third round since 1912 .
what do you think the women are doing well that the men have n't been able to do ?
do you think there are major differences in the different paths that have been taken ? are the women generally doing something different than the guys are doing as much as you know about the guy 's path ?
i read i think yesterday that you 're carrying your blanket from when you were a baby around and it 's like a rag now ; is that true ?
it 's a real security blanket ? you got the whole linus thing going on ?
what color is it ?
you win the next round will you show it to us ?
congratulations .
can you explain the turnaround from 6love ?
next round against flipkens again .
will it be a completely different match than in paris ?
do you rate your chances higher on grass than on clay ?
tough one , i guess . did you feel like you were in control in that second set ?
did you feel like you did anything wrong in the tiebreak , or was it just that she found her form when she needed it ?
i guess she 's a very tough player on this surface . her game really suits grass , does n't it ?
how tough is it waiting for the rain ?
how did you find the court ?
can i ask you one about laura robson ? you played her two years ago here . i guess you might not be surprised to see her doing well .
did kanepi surprise you somehow today ?
what do you think is the potential for her now ?
what happened with your game today ? you are disappointed in some tactical , technical issue ?
did you do some background , watch previous games ? your coach was , obviously ? what he told you ?
before the game how much did he know about kanepi ?
you 're another seeded player to crash out . many surprises this year . was it just another one ?
was it kind of a frustrating day for you today with the weather and all that kind of stuff ?
the moment of the rain stopped it was a very vital point . do you think that changed the outcome of the game ?
because the rain delay was 3040 , was n't it ?
do you or have you lived in miami ?
you live there now ?
why in miami ? any particular reason ?
who did ?
a private person ?
where do you train there ?
yeah , i 'm from boca . how long have you been there ?
was there a point at all where you thought or you were talking about going israel ?
in the past was there ?
who your coach in miami ?
anyone from the tour ? there are a lot of players down there .
okay . are you going to go into the doubles or the mixed now ? where will you go now ?
you have a problem with your shoulder ?
have you had it xrayed ?
the right ?
what do they say ?
the reason we asked you if you were going to israel is there was a rumor that you had been approached to play for them . was that a rumor ?
it was n't true ?
you 'll be back next year ?
you must be happy with the win .
did you approach this match any differently to the last time you played her ?
seven breaks of serve towards the end of that first set . can you describe what was going on there ?
you played knapp years ago in sydney winning 61 , 6love . you probably do n't remember .
what do you expect now ? today she hit 14 aces , and 80 % of points when she put the first serve in . what do you expect from her ?
how did you stay focused during the twohour rain delay ?
andy murray has challenged you to a showdown in las vegas . what is your answer ?
yes .
you 've done that before . do you remember that match in australia ?
how about karsten , if you played him now ?
on a scale of 1 to 10 , how would you rate your performance so far ?
with caroline and maria out , what do you think ? are you happy or ...
your next opponent is japanese veteran kimiko . what are your thoughts on her ?
there have been a few comments from some of the other players talking about the way the courts have been playing , slips and withdrawals . how have they been playing from your point of view ? any different from previous years ?
in your experience , have they been playing as well as ever ?
when you were here two days ago we asked your reaction to rafa 's upset loss . now roger has lost . what is your reaction to that and to yesterday , in general ?
seeing some of those surprising results , how much attention do you pay on a day when you 're not playing to what else is going on at a tournament ? when there are a bunch of big names losing all at once , does that leave any sort of impression with you or put in your mind the idea of , hey , there 's some crazy results out there , got to make sure nothing like that happens to me ?
martina navratilova and boris becker have been praising your play this week and throughout the whole year . they also said a 31yearold serena would beat a 21yearold serena in a match . is this the most confident you 've ever felt in your career ?
with venus not here this time , did you give any thoughts to giving the mixed another shot this year ?
about your next opponent , she played your sister two years ago here . i was wondering if you watched that match , what kind of impression did you get ? you said kimiko can be dangerous , especially on grass . what do you think makes her difficult on grass ?
madison keys talked today about you being an inspiration to her . she also talked about you giving her advice on her nails . could you tell us your relationship with her and the secrets on the nails .
you and your family have been through so , so much . when you talked to the family of the teenager in ohio , you mentioned that you had learned so much and realized a number of things . can you reflect on what she went through and what you learned about that whole issue .
back to the andy murray thing , you must be confident you 'd be taking some points off him .
you get better and better each year . what is your biggest motivation behind life ?
back to kimiko , she 's 11 years older than you . do you see yourself playing at 42 ?
what 's the meaning of the pow ?
did you do that ?
laura robson , a young british hope . what have you seen of her in this tournament ? generally on the tour , what have you made of her game ?
do you think she should be top 10 , top 20 ?
i imagine you would be pretty pleased with that in nearly every way .
you said the other day you rehearsed a few things playing against a qualifier . was that more like your classic game today ?
i know it 's only two rounds in , but you look like you 're feeling more comfortable on grass here than maybe ever before .
is there anything you think you 've learned about the grass that you did n't know in past years ?
do you think having a little bit earlier exit in paris gave you more time to get used to this , or is it more mental ?
what are some of the little things you 're doing better on grass this time ? what are the secrets ?
obviously lisicki will be different than the first two matches . what sort of adjustments do you make to play her ?
people look at your game , the big serve and the big forehand , which are normally things that translate to grass . lisicki has done well on grass with those same basic weapons . this is only your second time into the third round at wimbledon in like 11 tries . what 's the difference between her success here and yours ? is it about the spin ?
so one good year here even though it 's just third round sort of make you snap back into being okay with the surface for the rest of your career ?
about the courts , the was a bit of carnage yesterday , and some of the players thought the courts were different from other years . have you noticed anything different ?
if the ball is getting up here , does that mean it might help your game a little bit ?
would it be accurate to say you 're playing more aggressively this year ?
what do you remember about when you played madison keys in december ? she 's your next opponent .
was n't it at miami that you played her ?
where do you find your level right now ?
did you feel healthy and relaxed coming into the tournament ?
not so relaxed ?
how did it feel walking out to centre court today ?
what was the walk like ? the last time you did that walk you were going out for a grand slam final .
do you do anything in between matches to keep relaxed so you 're not thinking about defending the final ?
no fun things ?
did you watch last year 's final again since then ?
have you looked at it ?
not even once ?
how would you describe how serena williams is playing at this time ?
what did you think yesterday with victoria not playing , caroline going out , sharapova , federer , all the injuries ?
serena and andy murray are joking about playing each other in a match . if those two face off , what do you think serena 's chances are ?
you choose the surface for serena .
which male player would you like to play ? how would you do against janowicz on clay ?
how about he only has second serves ?
underhand serves ?
who has better touch , you or jerzy ?
so you 're a grass court specialist now ?
very big serving day , in the clutch , when you needed to .
you said that you liked the surface . what is it about the surface that you like so much ?
so the grass has n't been an issue with you slipping or anything like that ?
going back to your serve , do you remember learning how to serve ? do you remember being taught how to serve ? what do you recall of that ?
did you enjoy it when you first started learning how to serve or did you not like serving ?
who taught you the high ball toss ?
you have n't been to a lot of wimbledons . what did you think of yesterday , and how much of it did you watch ?
what shocked you the most about it ?
glad you were n't playing yesterday ?
do you think upsets are contagious ?
a lot of american kids take off for europe when they 're young . you 've done spain , italy , belgium , france , now here . what has been the most fun part of your european trip ?
what sight did you find most interesting when you went out ?
why do you think it is that now seems to be the comingout party of the next generation of american teenagers ?
do you guys encourage each other over here ?
you mentioned upsets before . it might be in the next round that you face radwanska . can you describe what sort of an opportunity that would be .
what do you know of her as a player and how would you describe your respective styles ?
what do you like about her game the most ?
you have a pretty big serve when it 's going well . do you ever think following it to the net ? is that something you do n't feel comfortable doing at this point ?
ever ?
how much do you do it in doubles ?
but not even as a surprise tactic is it something you 're comfortable doing ?
jimmy connors just wrote a book where he spoke a lot about growing up in illinois . you were born in rock island . can you tell us about it .
on the river ? what 's the 'island ' bit ?
do you remember when you played roehampton juniors and was that the first time you actually hit on grass ? 2011 you played wimbledon juniors ?
what was that like hitting on grass for the first time ?
so footing , watching you today , seems like the power is there , but you 're still at times struggling with the movement a little bit ?
did you fall down today ?
is there a skill to that ? are you surprised to see some of these players falling down several times in a match ?
a little bit more about your early years . did you first start to play on public or club courts ? were you taught by lawyers ?
what is the club ?
what does serena williams ' example mean to you ?
in terms of her game , why she dominates , what impresses you the most ?
what about the mental side ? what have you learned from her example ?
do you remember watching any williams sisters finals when you were younger from wimbledon ?
do you think you 've learned some things about how not to get ahead of yourself over the last year or so ? how do you feel you 'll do here with that ?
one of the themes of usta player development , is that you have to take each step at a time . what does that mean to you , that you ca n't skip a step ?
you 're the third teenager into the third round . looking back at juniors , are those names that surprise you seeing the next teen generation or ...
do you have a hero in sports ?
back to the radwanska match . did she totally frustrate you ?
she seemed to have a response to every single thing you did ?
is there a particular moment or point that stands out from that match for you ?
how much of it being over quickly was the mental side of having to play her ?
is there a point where you started feeling like you belong out on the tour ?
your parents are not here ?
at what point would they come here ?
what are your expectations ? understanding you 're enjoying this process , you have a tough opponent ...
the circuit can be a tough place . has any older player reached out to you or given you any advice in any way ?
what has serena said to you ?
nontennis .
does she have good advice ?
congratulations on the performance which got praise from serena today . you seem to have picked up some new fans in wimbledon . talk about the experience and how difficult it is playing this lady .
at one point you put your hands up . were you saying , what can you do against this woman ? how can i beat this woman ? she 's very tough , is n't she ?
you always seem to play very well against top players . is it easier to play your best against them for some reason ?
what do you think you need to do to play that level against everyone ?
one quick question : you probably have been asked this a lot of times , but when andy murray made a statement about you , was that a problem or was it encouraging ? what was your feeling ?
it 's a good ambition , is n't it ?
seems like a few of the teenagers are starting to make an impact on the tour again after a few years . why do you think that is ?
is it easier for younger players to hold their own now ?
you said '93'94 . are you aware of who the other '93'94 players are ? do you keep track of their results and compare ?
well played . noticed your leg as you walked past . everything okay ?
was that a regulation slip ?
good win for you today .
likely you could play laura robson the next round . home fans will be interested in that . what are your thoughts on that matchup ?
is that something you enjoy , if you 're playing on a bigger court with a vocal crowd ?
i think it 's your first time in the third round since 2008. is that a reflection of how well you 're playing this year ?
i think you played some doubles with heather watson .
obviously her and laura have a lot of expectations from the british fans . have you seen them mature and try to cope with that as players ? is it hard for them as well , do you think ?
i suppose it get magnified particularly at this time of the year with wimbledon . but the british players have n't been terribly successful , unfortunately .
obviously the british fans will be talking about laura , but you 'll be looking at the draw and thinking , well hang on here . this is a great opportunity for me to go a bit further and really make an impact .
the difference is if you 're playing robson , it could well be on the one of the big show courts . if you 're playing duquemarino , could be on the outside court . it 's suddenly a whole different environment depending on who you play .
is that easier , though , when you 've had 16,000 as opposed to playing in front of 2,000 ? i mean , it 's a very different environment with sort of the theatrical nature of the court as well .
how much of an effect did the fall have on your performance today ?
how will you summarize your game today ?
you did not like you were moving very well . was there any problem with your movement ?
a very frustrating 2013 for you thus far . can you put your finger on what 's exactly going wrong with your game ?
how was your ankle ?
maria just went over , and the bbc have put out that she said the court was dangerous under her breath . would you go that far ?
is it coincidence that victoria , yourself , and maria ...
do you find the courts different from previous years ?
did you already come onto court with a taped ankle ?
did the slip affect that ankle ?
would you and the top players speak to the all england club and say that something needs to be done about this ?
there were points in the second set where there were balls that if you were feeling okay that you would easily run down . so your leg or ankle never got to the point where you could have any kind of push to make the effort that you wanted to ?
how would you describe what the grass felt like under your shoes today versus previous experiences , and maybe any differences in different parts of the court ?
would you say you had enough practice on grass before coming here or you need more practice on grass before coming here ?
you 're okay with the grass ?
important part of the season coming up for you next , the u.s. hard courts . are you looking to make any sort of changes ? i know you 're trying out new racquets and stuff . anything else going on going into this next stretch ?
do you expect it to be a long recovery , or do you expect to be back quickly ?
it did n't come easy . talk about the battle .
you 're 83 in threesetters . talk about that .
do you have confidence when it goes to three , regardless what happens in the second set ?
do you have any awareness of the seven players that retired or had walkovers , and wozniacki , sharapova , ivanovic losing ? any of that take note ?
sixth straight slam you made the third round at . pretty good consistency early in your career . how do you think you 've been able to do that ?
indian ?
what is your feeling on the shape of the courts ? some of the players are saying they 're too slippery and that 's why shares injuries .
do you find it easier to focus at the slams because they are so important ?
you did n't seem to be slipping too much out there in comparison to others . could you talk about your footwork , your balance , your athleticism ? do you think that 's a strength ?
you have cetkovska next . beat her last year here in three . thoughts on that match .
do you feel like now after today that the bottom half is there for whoever wants to grab it ?
azarenka .
do you ever look at matches as gutcheck matches ? could this have been one with a player that is former top 10 , not that much to lose ?
how important was it to go home after roland garros and relax ? you all have long clay court seasons . did you feel a lot better coming back to europe ?
are you able to forget the tennis ? are you able to put the tennis aside ?
grandparents are trying to watch you on the machine ?
who is mrs.neumeir and what did you talk about ?
is it just a new generation ?
any more additional expectations you put on yourself when you see all these big names going out of your section ?
are you aware that younger players are winning , like robson , bouchard , keys , and puig all still in the tournament and all still ambitious ?
did you have an idea when you all went to the same academy that you all could be this good ?
what were you ?
so you were baby bear for a while ?
maybe middle bear ?
what about your relationship to wimbledon , to grass , to the all england club ?
could that happen this year ?
we 're very unused to see you losing to unseeded opponents . did you put that down to the quality of her play , the court ? what was the issue today ?
you seemed to be unhappy with the state of the court . you slipped a couple of times . were you unhappy with the surface today ?
how would you describe the court conditions and what you experienced today ?
most of your press conferences so far this week , people have been asking you more about sugarpova , serena , boyfriends . has that been a distraction for you ?
are the courts different in any way this year that you 've noticed ?
the lip readers who looked at the television pictures think that you said to the chair that , this court is dangerous . is that what you said to her ?
you played a solid first round . how big of a blow is it to get out of the tournament that you like this much ?
did you hurt yourself ? are you injured ? are you okay ?
when you said you were n't there today , you do n't know why ?
after you slipped once or twice , is it now in your mind every time you try to stop that your feet could leave you ?
how much does that uncertainty about your footwork or the surface seep into your entire game ? there were returns you were missing . did it generally leave you completely rattled ?
do you think wimbledon needs to check the courts just to make sure they 're safe ?
obviously very close match today . what do you feel made the difference ?
given everything that 's happened today , are you happy just to finish in one piece ?
obviously you 're dealing with the injury as well , but a lot of players have gone down and slipped and fallen today . is there something with the grass ?
so you do n't feel like there is anything special about today or the grass ?
yes .
finally , just talk about where you feel you are in your comeback . you 're starting to have better results . do you feel like you 're getting back to where you were ?
did she surprise you ?
were you hoping or thinking maybe that being on centre court she had never been on there before that that that might unnerve her ?
how did you feel about your game ?
as you know , canada is like serbia . it 's a small tennis country that 's trying to become a big tennis country . do you see some of the things in canada that happened in serbia a few years ago ?
how disappointing is this ? did you feel like this was a tournament you would have a really good shot at ?
what 's eugenie 's main quality , would you say ?
the court as well . few slips out there . how did you feel out there today ?
faster ?
you said you had never played her before . would you have any opportunity to scout her or see tape or just figure it out as you go ?
who do you think is the favorite now ?
are the courts playing any differently this year than previous years ?
you 've seen lots of young players come up and have been asked about them ...
the change of court did n't seem to bother you .
first time on center court ?
you said you were really happy it was switched .
why ?
we 're trying to figure it out , but it 's possible that no canadian has ever won a singles match on centre court at wimbledon .
well , no one seems to have an answer yet . if you were to have that piece of history , that would be amazing .
was there anything tricky about centre court ?
had you ever been in there before as a spectator ?
this was obviously a very big win for you . did you feel it coming with your form being good in the runup ?
she said she did n't know you . she had never played you . do you think that was an advantage ? because i would assume you knew her game and what to expect a little bit more .
you talked the other day about being a young player and all the pressure is on the older players . i think she was hoping maybe the pressure would be on you because it was on centre court . did you feel the pressure was on her because she 's the higher seed and all those things you talked about ?
laura robson describes you as her bestie . talk about your friendship a little bit . i take it there was n't enough time to pass on any advice about playing on centre court .
you stayed with her here in the past , have n't you ?
this year what do you do ?
who is here with you ? it must be quite a big thing for the family , this fortnight .
who is over with you ?
the two double faults in that 32 game i think in the second set , once you got over those you were maybe a bit vulnerable then . where did they come from , and once you got over them did you feel free again ?
you had a chance to serve it out . then did you get a bit of the jitters at that point ?
i noticed you tweeted a picture . tomas berdych seemed to be quite fond of a picture of you . not to be too crass , but are you prepared that if you go on a long run you may be held up as a sex symbol given you 're very good looking ?
what was the crowd like there compared to other crowds you 've played in front of ?
the way they react is a little more muted . it 's not as wild and crazy as new york new york .
this is the first year in a while quite a lot of teenagers are doing well . is it just a very strong generation you think we have ? is there a reason for it ?
you talked about how the experience against sharapova maybe helped you . did it help you a little bit maybe keep calm ?
what was the procedure like leaving the locker room ? is there a ritual thing ?
it 's not exactly same route .
those of us that are ignorant about westmount , what 's it like and sort of what was it like growing up there ?
is it quite a homely environment , quite a small town ?
what 's the relationship with you and natalie now ? is she still your parttime coach ?
just given her history , obviously ...
your half of the draw has opened up with some of the seeds being knocked out and azarenka pulling out . do you envisage a path through ?
i know you 've got to prepare for your next match , but are you able to celebrate victories like this ?
what is it about you that allowed you not to be intimidated today ?
how different is this to your usual futures and challenger tournaments that you 've played previously ?
so would you say that 's your biggest win of your career ?
i wanted to ask you about your coaching situation with your father . does he still attend wimbledon ?
was that difficult to actually kind of separate ?
was that a decision you 've been thinking about for quite a while ?
was it easy to be able to separate your personal and professional relationships when your father was your coach ?
does he still like to give you vice ahead of big matches ?
since the injury , can you just describe what happened the past couple of days ? what 's going on ?
it 's torn ? it 's a strain ? do you know exactly what it is ?
how long will you be out now ?
when did you decide to give up ? when did you know that you were not going to play today ?
we keep seeing pictures of people falling . is there anything different with the courts this year ?
did the ball bounce any differently ?
what was bad about the condition of the court ?
the foot injury earlier this season , now this . mentally i guess it 's frustrating and tough at the moment .
did you feel in shape to be winning the tournament as well ?
now where are you going ? are you staying here ?
you said you were frustrated with the condition of the court . did you speak to the club and let your concerns be known ?
how do you get past this mentally ? how do you get over the disappointment ? how do you regroup and come back from this ?
did they tell you how long before you could be back out ?
grass court is your biggest fear now ?
your hip too , or just the knee ? i heard your hip was maybe injured at the same time .
have you seen the video yourself ?
when you started out there on centre court , there were quite a number of empty seats around the royal box . how do you feel about that ? you 're the defending champion , some people not taking their seats , does that bother you ?
obviously women 's tennis is a very popular sport , there 's a lot of money in it , much more so than women 's soccer or even golf . why do you think that is ?
what was your reaction to the news that nadal lost yesterday ?
how surprising was it to you ?
what 's the big switch clay to grass ? the bounce ? what do you have to adapt to quickly ?
please do n't think i 'm contesting women 's rights to equal pay , but do you think there would be more justification for it if you did equal work for equal pay , in other words , play bestoffive ?
given madison keys ' victory today , what are your thoughts about the state of the american women 's game coming up behind you ?
a lot of people say obviously you 're the player to beat , that they do n't see who is out there that can beat you . how do you feel ?
talking about changes of surface , could you give us some update or reminder about your schedule after wimbledon before the us open , how that tests you .
what 's so attractive about bastad ?
over your career you 've said lots of wild and crazy things . i was stunned the other day to see in the transcript where you said you were basically treated by the tennis journalists fairly , that you were spoiled by the treatment , that it was professional treatment . were you smoking something ? what is your thought on the job that we do ?
do you think the media seriously plays an important role in getting the story out to fans and nonfans ?
over the last few days , there have been a few stories about how you and maria sharapova have had a few words exchanged . has that been a distraction ? do you have any further remarks to make now ?
how did it feel after all this talk , all the questions from sunday , how did it feel to finally get started playing tennis ?
have you and maria spoken since your last press conference ? are you friends again now ?
how did you assess today 's match ? can you learn anything from it ?
do you come out of today 's match thinking all about ways you want to improve , something you want to work on as the tournament moves along ?
can you give any examples ?
we have queuing up all night hoping to get in for a ticket . would you like to see the corporate ticketholders get in there and see the tennis or give the ticket to someone who wants to be in there ?
you 've talked about how you really miss your sister this year . has wimbledon not been quite the same because of her absence ?
with nelson mandela in critical condition now , what are your reflections on what his life means to you and to the world ?
why was it one of the best moments of your life ?
back to tennis . after play yesterday , people were talking about slow courts , also a lot of players getting injuries . azarenka slipped . how did the court feel for you today ?
your game is renowned for its power . today your opponent won a number of her points with mixing it with slice and some dropshots . if you 're still seeking to improve your own game , do you contemplate embracing that kind of variation or do you think that would diminish your game ?
you mentioned how amazing it was to meet president mandela , to read about him . obviously the man was in jail for 27 years , came back and had this force of reconciliation and forgiveness . have you reflected on that ? is that an important part of our lives ?
have you ever lost a match with a game like that ? that was very unlucky .
irrespective of what happened today , you said a few days ago wimbledon is your favorite tournament . i 'm sure it still is . what is it in particular about wimbledon you like so much ?
do you not really feel you are too much under pressure , too much pressure here for you ?
which is your favorite , grass or ...
we know you 've had your problems coming back from the glandular fever , so on . can that tiredness still creep in ?
was it the right decision to come back when you did come back ? did you feel you were ready to come back ?
a more general question . despite your loss today , how would you describe the state of british women 's tennis at the moment ?
what do you think could be done to bring it forward ? is it a matter of female coaches ?
you spoke recently about how some of the top players like serena williams and maria sharapova , they 're not that friendly .
i wonder what the locker room atmosphere has been like ? any of the more senior ones speaking to you guys , or is it the same ?
has there been any kind of bad atmosphere between the female players ?
is today a reminder probably not to you , but to everybody watching how difficult it is in the women 's game to break into the top 40 ?
what are the doctors telling you ? have you got the `` all clear '' now ?
just down to you , basically ?
would you say the reason why it went wrong for you today is perhaps because of the illness , or do you think there were other factors as well ?
do you still feel lethargic physically ? how frustrating is that ?
it was n't a great day for the other brits yesterday . was that something you were keeping an eye on ? did you take that onto court with you , that thought ?
when do you plan to play your first event on the hard courts in america ? before that , are you planning a sort of andy murraystyle training block to improve your fitness ?
is madison a teenager coming through you see with the most potential , maybe the most exciting ?
do you watch other women play , videos , to learn from it ?
what did you make of your performance ?
one of your better matches on grass ?
good opponent for you in a way . she was n't going to beat you but made you work .
do things feel any different to previous years ?
do you know much about pushkova ?
i heard you trained at sutton tennis academy , not very far from here .
can you describe the academy ?
you mentioned you 're playing with a bit more clarity on grass . does that come down to experience or ...
without revealing obviously tactics , et cetera , there one or two different things you 're trying to do this year ?
in a sense be less predictable ?
i was reading somewhere this is the first time in over 60 years there 's only been one woman in the open singles . does that put extra pressure on you ? can you talk about why you 're the only one .
so do you feel that you 're kind of the elder statesman of female tennis in australia ? do you think there needs to be a pathway for some of the younger ones ?
you like court no.1 , do n't you ?
how significant a victory was that for you ?
talk us what was going through your mind when you were tossing the ball up in the final game . looked nervous .
in the first set you did n't do that hardly at all . was that because you feel so comfortable at wimbledon ?
you 've had some big wins in your career . where does this one rank ?
you 've been working with miles maclagan for the last few weeks . has there already been a noticeable change in your game ?
you 've obviously done incredibly well . you 're the only british female who has got through the first round in singles . what do you think is wrong with female tennis in britain ?
do you feel you have the game to beat a top 4 player this week or next week ?
maria sharapova yesterday said she 's not very close to many people on the tour . i noticed she did the introduction to your gangnam style video . do you have a good relationship with her ?
do you relish playing the top seeds , and how does it affect your game ?
you talked about the boost you got during the olympics . is that something you 'd like to encourage them to do again ?
is it difficult to shut it out when the crowd sort of go , ohhh , when you miss a shot ? it 's a very unique thing to wimbledon .
the state of british tennis . are we wrong to judge it in terms of how the players do at wimbledon ? that seems to be the barometer that everyone uses .
you 've opened up your part of the draw . what now would be a good tournament for you ?
a lot has been made of the andy murray documentary on sunday night . during the program you tweeted that you 're so competitive you spent seven hours trying to beat you at a video game . sounds like you 've got a very good relationship , and maybe you can inspire each other maybe ?
i 'm not sure how tara is getting on at the moment , but do you feel a lot of pressure as potentially the only woman going forward in the tournament ? what sort of pressure do you feel ?
back to andy murray , has he said anything about you calling him a dork ?
obviously a higherranked player in the next round . how do you feel about going into the match ?
wondered if you had a chance to speak to your mum and if she 's regretting not finding a dog sitter ?
your brother was watching from the sidelines i noticed . what is it like with him working here ?
i know she 's obviously ranked in the top 10 , but did you half expect to win this match or think you should win today ?
the work that you 've done , that made the big difference in the service today in terms of its accuracy ?
virginia wade said on tv shortly after your match that she feels you can achieve something incredible here . what would your measurement of 'incredible ' be ?
you 've spoken a little bit about your nerves , struggling with the ball toss . do you dread seeing your name coming up on court1 or centre court ? would you prefer to be on one of the outside courts ?
talk about wimbledon , first main draw match , what your feelings were before you went on the court and the way you felt the way it went overall ?
i think you said when you came off court that during warmup , someone was cheering when you hit a ball into the net .
first time in your life ?
you felt pretty comfortable as it went on ? you know heather . you probably hit with her before .
how difficult is it playing a home player , a player who is being cheered so wildly ?
you said once that you liked the loud crowd wherever you played . would you rather it be loud and against you or just dead silent ?
so what do you think about this place , wimbledon ? how does it compare to other places you 've played ?
is there any sense of camaraderie among the young american women that are coming up right now , or is it you 're all doing well on your own path ?
we have all these young players , dynamic country . do you think you 're part of something special , a turn of tennis in america ?
it looks like from the outside you have a very good game for grass . do you feel that yet ? are you adjusting to the surface ?
how much do you practice with some of the other young americans , like sloane stephens and jamie hampton ?
if you see jamie working out before you out on the courts , does that piss you off or drive you to work harder ?
what is your favorite part of working with the group , working with the usta ?
if and when you imagined yourself playing in a slam when you were younger , did you imagine yourself on grass here or at the us open ? where was it ?
what did you make of heather 's performance today ? did you sense she was a little bit flat after her glandular fever ?
can you talk about your journey from the start of the year . you started off well , up and down at times , but how it 's been because it 's more or less your first full six , seven months on tour .
physically how are you holding up since it 's your first full year playing a fairly full schedule ? how is your body at this point ?
has it felt like you 've been in europe like forever ?
back in france , serena williams was asked to describe herself in one word . she came up with a spectacular answer . if you were asked to describe yourself in a word , what would that be ?
you 've got to be kidding . do you enjoy the sassy part of life ?
how did you feel about that last point in the match , the last game ?
are you sarcastic with yourself on court in your head ?
what do you say to yourself ?
i know it 's old news now , but can you believe it 's four years since you beat serena ? i know it was only an exhibition match , but as a 14yearold , can you explain what that did for your confidence back then .
in that second set when heather had her good spell , was the sarcastic voice in you saying , here we go again ?
how many times have you been to chipotle ?
what have you been eating here ?
which is basically like going to chipotle ?
watching you on the court today , you were really serious , really focused . nothing like the person we 're seeing now . is that a real conscious effort to not be your normal self but your player self on the court ?
as you get more experienced and kind of more used to all this , might we see more of the real you on court in time ?
what did you think when the draw happened on friday and you saw your name come out against bethanie ?
thought ?
and you 've never beaten her before , is that right ?
what did you think you did well today ?
did you find it hard to get rhythm ? because she seemed to hit lots of winners and lots of errors as well .
do you think much about last year , your run to the semifinals ?
how did you find the conditions out there today ?
you were playing with an unbranded racquet you were trying out . what were you playing with today ?
were you playing with a yonex racquet today ?
three and three . must have been a little smoother than you were expecting .
tell us about your preparation . you had a bit of a disappointing french open . what have you done between then and now ?
on grass , what do you think comes easy to you and what is challenging for you on this surface ?
was it trickier out there today kind of overcast and cold ? did it feel more slippery ?
talk a little bit about practicing and not playing any tournaments beforehand .
what do you think the difference was in this match ?
jamie was highly complimentary of your game , power athleticism , and all that . also said she was aware of your ranking , and that you 're the highest ranking american after serena , and that the young americans , too , sort of pressure each other . talk about that factor . do you see yourself in a way as the leader in the postserena generation ?
do you think an american in the postserena generation can a win slam in the next couple years ?
what do you think ?
were you disappointed to have to face jamie in the first round ?
do you feel like you 've played enough of these four grand slams to give us your characterization of wimbledon versus the other ones ?
you said in france , i 'm a 20 year old and i can do whatever i want . what do you want to do ?
you got plenty of time .
what do you order ?
what about , was it your grandfathers crab curry ?
you found the time to write to hagen dazs yet ?
dry ice . so is that a super superstition that you got to go to rajdoot ?
what 's you are with favorite indian restaurant in l.a. ?
so you do n't like wimbledon tandoori ?
before this first round you said you were expecting a tough match . i think you got definitely a tough start for the tournament .
would you prefer tough firstround matches when you see the draw , see a big hitter ? is that something you like ? would you like something a little more regular ?
after your comments on saturday , serena was here yesterday . she said she apologized to you . what happened ?
just to clarify , she said she apologized . did you receive an apology from her ?
is part of it because you do n't want it to be a distraction ?
is your feeling more of sorrow or anger about what occurred ?
this week there 's a commemoration of 40 years of the wta . we have some of the best players ever playing right now . when you think of the sport , who do you consider the greatest woman player ever and why ?
if you could play one player who you have n't played ?
how do you think you 'd play with her great forehand , her speed ?
you were old enough to see her play and remember seeing her play . do you remember her being dominant and thinking when you watched her that she was so dominant , she could beat anyone ?
you said she would chop you up . how do you think it would work out if it were graf against serena williams ?
you were saying before wimbledon starts , this is your job , all of that . you 're used to compartmentalizing . is this time difficult doing it or you 're so used to doing it it 's routine ?
do you generally have a good relationship with the other players in the tournament ?
is the oneonone competition where there 's always going to be a winner and loser , is that a tough part of the job , or is that just something that you come to enjoy , the competitive nature of your profession ?
it 's not clear yet who your next opponent will be , but can you break down the prospects against each of them separately ?
when you say you 're not really close to a lot of players , is that something strategic that you 're doing ? do you think it 's different on the men 's tour than the women 's tour ?
some athletes do n't want to be friends with other athletes because they do n't want to give away secrets or form a bond .
what was your take on kim clijsters when she was active and would be so engaging to other players and people , so friendly ? she even said once her goal was to make friends on the tour .
through your activities on the tour and with the united nations , you 've traveled all over the world , met international political figures . what are your thoughts today about nelson mandela who is in critical condition ?
what does his legacy mean to you ?
you said that you like being in england . what is it that you particularly like about england as opposed to other places you 've been ?
you had a very successful french open . how did you work to build off that for wimbledon ?
where do you think that confidence has come from ?
what do you think of wimbledon ? first time here ?
could you tell me a little bit about your background coming from puerto rico ? when did you leave there ?
will the people of puerto rico be aware of this win ?
so you 're a national hero ?
did you have any tennis idol when you were a kid ?
if tennis is a little less popular in puerto rico , do how did you get into it ?
grass does n't suck too badly .
talk about the clay result , making the final there , how much of that really , even though it was clay , helped you .
going back to the french open you said you were playing stiff . was that mental or physical ?
talk your next match against sloane .
what went wrong today ? what was the problem ?
you must be a little bit sick of wimbledon after last year with shvedova and now this .
is there anything you think one day you can do to make life easier for yourself on grass ?
can you describe your thoughts on your opponent today and what her future might be ?
what are the best things about her game , would you say ?
plenty of people say there is really nobody who can beat serena williams right now . what are your thoughts on her and the difference between her and all the other players ?
are you still suffering with the injury from last week that put you out of eastbourne ?
obviously disappointing . it seems as though you were really into the match the first set .
why the lack of consistency in your game today ?
you had your problems with injuries and so on . you 've even talked about retirement . you put off retirement . after that defeat , will we continue to see you back here at wimbledon in years to come ?
i noticed you played flavia in your first wimbledon qualifier in 2000. what do you remember of that match ? how has this wimbledon experience changed ?
how will you use your protected ranking over the next few months ?
i think pretty much all the brits here are playing higherranked opponents . it 's been quite a tough draw . how close an eye will you keep on the other results ? how important is it to get a couple wins ?
do you find yourself under extra pressure when you 're given a wild card to try to perform ?
if you 're given a wild card .
is it rather strange , obviously being the first match up , you 'll have played the first match at a tournament before , but to think this early in the day , wimbledon is over for me this year ? does it feel odd ?
after what you 've been through down the years , you 're still here , you 're still fighting . when you say you have three or four left , maybe good years , what are your ambitions now ?
are you generally happy with how things are progressing ? you had a good two weeks leading into here .
you mentioned before it 's been a tough draw for all the british players . laura and heather , a lot of attention on them . is it important that they make it through , at least last till the end of the week ?
madison keys .
when you said you quit after the olympics last year , because you never really announced it officially , at what stage did you officially or unofficially unretire ?
at what stage did you decide you were not retired anymore ?
did you watch andy 's documentary last night ?
he 's been extremely successful . would you have hoped that he would have been an example to have better results instead of the odd good result ?
but is the talent pool there in this country ? you would have seen the younger ones coming through .
would n't that be finding them in different places ? good or ill , tennis is still perceived as a middle class sport . maybe the hungrier , the ones that are n't from that background , they can see that as a way out .
what background are those kids from ?
they 're in sort of the more deprived areas of town ?
if you look back after the last decade or so , do you feel you 've gone as far as you could have done , given your talent , or do you feel you 've done your talent justice ?
in paris you had a relationship with clay you did n't put the ring on the finger . but clay moved in with you . what 's up with grass ? do you need some counseling , going to get a divorce ? what 's up ?
can you talk us through what happened with the injury ?
at that moment did you think your tournament might be over ?
did you receive some reassuring news ? do you know now the extent of the injury ? do you hope you can recover in time for your next match ?
you still have more physical examinations to undergo ?
it looked and sounded terminal when you did it . we were really concerned for you .
you seem fortunate in the extent she did n't put a lot of pressure , did n't make you run a lot .
but she did n't move you about the court hardly at all . you were rooted to the baseline hitting the ball back to her and she responded in kind .
the same place .
given what happened , what are your thoughts about having made it through , about being so tough in the face of this injury to survive this match ?
now that you made it through , what are your thoughts about having done it ?
was there any thought , given serena and maria 's back and forth this week , that you could fly under the radar a little bit , that you could escape the drama a little bit to your advantage ?
our sport obviously focuses on the four majors which are so important . now you 've had a series of health problems here , the incident when it was so hot in new york , the breathing situation in australia . can you talk about having such an intense health situation , injury , during the biggest events we have ? can you compare them a bit .
a few words about your opponent . it was her first main draw match at wimbledon . what did you see on the other side of the net ?
you spoke a little while ago about liking to avoid the drama , just keeping the concentration on the court . certainly that 's not been the case , as we 've seen . yet you 're somebody whose private life is pretty public , too . how have you managed to avoid that kind of drama ?
neither did they before the weekend started .
how did you draw on your years of experience when a friend of yours suffered a tough defeat in the first round in a big tournament back in america ? did you give some nice advice to console him after that setback ?
redfoo .
as someone who has traveled all over the world and is internationally known , what are your thoughts today as nelson mandela is dealing with a lifethreatening condition ?
what did the medics think the problem with your knee is ? ligament or cartilage damage ?
congratulations .
first grass court title . pretty convincing too , all the matches . how do you feel leaving here ?
i 'm guessing that areas you want to improve in the next week may be overheads .
yeah . the hands raised when you finally got one in was pretty special .
it was about a year ago that you split with nigel . when you hit the hard court season , you seemed to be playing much more freely at that point . you seemed to be enjoying things a lot more and you 've progressed so much from there to now . what actually has made the difference between the two years with nigel and now with nemanja ?
so now he 's a grass court specialist as well now ?
you lead the wta in match wins ; three titles , tied with maria and serena . you obviously beat them both this season . up to no.11 ; no.6 in the race to singapore . all these stats . what are you the most proud of about your season so far ?
this might sound like a stupid question and it may be one but a lot of athletes talk about how important it is for them to be happy in life to perform , in particular tennis players or individual sport athletes . why do you think that is ? why is it important to just be fine like mentally in life ?
and that impacts your tennis how ?
people will look at this grass court title and immediately think , okay , wimbledon . so how do you manage to keep sort of the pressurefree attitude that you 've got here and take that into a grand slam ?
has it been a gradual process for you , this sort of realizing that you had to be relaxed , or were there a moment where it suddenly clicked ?
so do you sort of kick yourself in a way and think , god , god i wish i had known this earlier ?
do you try to get back to being the tennis player you were when you won the french open , when you were world no.1 ?
or are you a different tennis player ?
have you drunk the champagne yet ?
when will you drink it ?
we were expecting to you come in with it .
going back if 2008 , if you were to give yourself some advice back then to you now , what would you tell yourself ?
do you feel like a grand slam champion ?
but have you put the french open , the 2008 french open behind you ? do you still take that with you everywhere you go ?
well done .
do you feel like a genuine grass court player now ?
seemed to time the ball perfectly well on this surface . hard to believe you 've had any problems on it in the past .
is it a mental thing as well ? is it mentally wanting to play , is that important ?
there was even a volley or two in there , was n't there ? you were very pleased with those .
talk a little bit about the difference between the court today . you got through just before the rain . you said that obviously yesterday it was bouncing quite high . today did it feel a little bit heavier ? you said you got off to a slow start .
i know you 're a bit of a perfectionist sometimes with your tennis . does grass make that a little bit harder ? you have to say like , okay , it 's okay i make mistakes ; if i 'm going forward , it 's the right thing . you just have to change your mindset a little bit ?
what do you remember of your 2007 run to the semifinals at wimbledon ? does it feel like a long time ago ? what was that whole entire two weeks like for you ?
when you went into the tournament that year , do you remember what your expectation were or what you thought , or just kind of going with it ?
which concert ?
do you feel this run here now makes you go to wimbledon feeling like a contender again , that you can win wimbledon ?
can you describe what it would mean from being a little girl in serbia to come to england and win a grass court tournament ? this one i am thinking rather than wimbledon .
this one .
did you go shopping yesterday after your win ?
do you also feel particularly after the french open , there is a lot change at the top of the game that it 's a very , very open tournament , wimbledon could be ?
do you feel like part of the new order or the old order ?
well done . for somebody who does n't like playing on grass , you 're doing extremely well , are n't you ?
i saw your coach , even when you came forward and missed the volley , he applauded you for trying to do that . is this how you 're trying to play on grass ?
you actually did not make many mistakes . do you feel now that even on grass you can play a game where you do n't make mistakes ? is it still possible ?
were you surprised at winning so comfortably , so easily ?
what did you expect to achieve this week , your goal for this week ?
last year you did not play grand slams .
can you say why ?
and your record in grand slams is no wins and eight losses ; that is something you are desperate to change ?
you mentioned your agent as a grass court player . who is your agent ?
she gives you advice ?
did you start a little bit nervous today ? because you were n't shouting as always .
were you delayed this morning ? were you late on court ?
congratulations . two out of two today .
looks like you 're going to have a careerhigh ranking on monday .
talk us through that a bit . does that really vindicate your decision to focus on singles this past year ?
back in 2008 , what were your goals when you were sort of floating around 39 , 40 , 50 in the rankings compared to what your goals are now ?
so 39 was on the hit list and make another semis was on the hit list . is there anything else beyond that you 're looking to achieve ?
you last played barbora a couple years ago . you remember much about that match ?
tough match obviously . being friends with casey and not playing her on tour in over a decade , sort of weird feeling out process on the court , switching gears with her a little bit .
she was 2love up on you going into in this match in terms of your head to head , but that was way back in like 2003 the last time you played .
what is it about her game that caught you today ?
you said yesterday that you were playing some really good tennis . you obviously seem quite positive coming out of this . what 's next now ?
what have you made of her year so far ? i think she 's risen 200 spots in the rankings in about ten months or so .
you said yesterday it was very much for you about trying to figure out how your game works on grass . after a day like today , do you go back to the drawing board , or is it the same sort of pattern ; just need a little bit more time ?
i do n't know if you care about this , but would you like casey to go on and win the tournament ?
do you think she can the way she played today ?
obviously yesterday you had a great start , well , the first match you had a great start to your match : 5love up in inside course of an hour . today the start of the match was a little hairier , shall we say .
does that set a tone for your mindset for the rest of the game ? whether it 's going to be , okay , i 'm really confident or i 've really got to dig in here , and how do you deal with both sides of the that ?
very well done today . seemed like you got off to a pretty quick start and never really looked back .
volleys were really good today . there was some flexing , stretching of the legs and sort of bending down .
you were standing very far in on her second serve . again , just the aggressive stance . are we going to see a lot more aggressive ana ?
can i ask you about the world cup ? will you watching and who will you be supporting ?
how long does it take for you to get comfortable on grass ? weeks ? matches ? days ?
you 've obviously had a fantastic 2014 so far . can you take confidence from surface to surface ? or when the tour switches , do you have to rebuild the confidence on that surface ?
i know you wear a credential every week and so you 're used to having a picture of yourself around your neck . but here , every single person at the tournament has a picture of you .
is it weird for you when you see everyone ...
you 've been at tournaments obviously where there have been big posters of you , the strong is beautiful stuff or whatever . do you get used to that , or every time you go somewhere and see your face everywhere is it sort of like , oh , there is me ?
do you think , ana , after the years that you 've been on tour and everything that 's happened , do you think people understand you ? do you think fans or the the way you 're perceived by media , fans , press , whatever , that you 're perceived accurately ? do you think we have a good picture of you , or no ?
so then can i ask , on tour , in the locker room , who 's the person that you 're most likely to be having these deep and meaningful conversations and debates about life with ?
obviously you and novak were very involved with the serbian floods and the flood relief . how is that going ? what 's the status of that ?
i do n't think you talked about this , at least here , but what are your thoughts on andy murray hiring a foreign top women 's player as a women 's player yourself ?
do you like the pushing boundaries ? is it exciting ?
did kimi surprise you there today ?
how are you feeling about your couple of matches here ?
is it even possible she could go on and win this tournament ?
that second set , did you get down on yourself a little bit ?
what does she do well ? she shortens rallies and comes forward unexpectedly . that takes way your rhythm , right ?
i imagine it 's never pleasant to lost a title , but still it 's matches you need on grass at this stage , which is the most important .
where will you play next week ?
how do you feel your grasscourt game is shaping up now ?
i need to is ask you an obligatory question about the world cup . will you be following it ?
saturday .
against italy .
well done today .
where do you think the match turned for you ? looked pretty much a reversal start of the second set .
eleven years since you last played each other . bound to be changes . anything in particular stand out today ?
was there a particular turning point ? is there one point you can kind of specifically say that 's where the match went your way ?
it 's very different match , is n't it , against kimiko date , obviously . what sort of mindset do you have going from a player with huge weapons , big serve and big forehand , to a player who will really sort of work you around the court .
especially for sam , and i guess a little bit for kimiko too , how hard is it when you 're friendly with somebody off court to switch into battle mode ? does it take a little bit of time to get used to that ?
how much more belief do you have now compared to maybe this time last year about your game ?
just one last one . everyone is getting asked this today . world cup starts tonight ? are you going to be watching ?
brazil croatia .
well played . is that the perfect start to your grass court campaign ?
is it difficult to wait three days into the tournament before you get your first game ?
well done . she almost got back into it . she nearly got back to 4all in the second set .
how important was that to prevent her doing that ?
looking at the game , the way play the game , you look well capable of doing well on grass , and yet at wimbledon so far you 've never gone deep into the tournament . why would that be ?
does it have anything to do with the fact that the french finishes so soon before wimbledon and you often do well in that ?
would you welcome the extra week between the two grand slams next year ?
i know you talked about things clicking for you last year at wimbledon and being happy there , the best you felt . can you say what that was that changed ? a small adjustment that suddenly made everything work and that still seems to be working today ?
sam , is it more difficult the tactical or the technical change to grass for yo ? so in terms of how you play the points , is that really where the confidence comes into play , or is it just the lower strike point and things like that on grass ? what 's the toughest ?
after the french open , how long did it take to get over that loss , but also realize that you were hitting the ball extremely well ? you were playing great tennis there . kind of an unfortunate draw really . yeah , i mean , does the disappointment linger at all ? are you moving on ?
and the leg is okay ?
if miles said one thing that has stuck in your mind coming into the grass court season , what would that be ?
is that part of your nature , you find yourself getting down or yourself ?
it was interesting seeing you have a hit with sloane stephens this morning . thoughts on that ? was that initiated by you ?
what did you think when you heard andy murray was hiring amlie mauresmo ?
what do you think when you hear of the people raising their eyebrows , i guess . like marinko matosevic , i do n't know if you heard what he said .
what do you think of that kind of reaction ?
have you ever thought about having a female coach ?
welcome back to birmingham . how does it feel to be back here and at a tournament that you just kind of own in a lot of ways ?
players talk about coming back to a tournament they 've played well at and they say , oh , immediately you feel comfortable and you 're confident . can you articulate why going back to a place that you 've played well at , where that confidence comes from ? is it just familiarity ? is it just knowing that the results have always come , how that helps your game , that sort of thing ?
you 're probably not going to get any christmas cards from the kichenok family this year . was it a very similar game playing ...
last year you mentioned that you had some superstitions , one of which you did n't change the clothes you slept in . are there any superstitions you can tell us about this year ?
you play sloane in the next round . i do n't think you 've played her before .
obviously you know each other .
what 's your view of that ?
is it fair to say that since you were last here in 2013 you 've actually kicked on , where in previous years you maybe did n't ?
you 've had a couple injuries this season , have you , is that right ?
no anxiety about that , any niggles ?
it 's not every week you get to play twins back to back . ( indiscernible . )
how long of a trip is this for you ? have you been home since the clay at all ? how long have you been here in europe ?
what 's been the toughest part about having such a long stretch away from home for you ?
unlucky today . seemed to be in that match right up until will end of the first set . can you explain what happened in the second set ?
are you relatively happy with your couple of matches and week 's work here ?
what 's the plan now , eastbourne ?
the wimbledon wildcards came out today , and you did n't need one .
what kind of pride is that for you to qualify directly for the tournament ?
what do you think of the program of wildcards in general ? obviously you 've got them in the past here and other places . some people say maybe they make the players a bit complacent or a bit of a handout when the players could be playing qualifying and earning their way in .
as a women 's player , obviously , what are your thoughts on andy hiring mauresmo ?
how does this tournament prepare you for the pressure of being a british player at wimbledon ?
is being british no.1 a goal of yours , something that matters to you ?
commiserations . how did that get away from you when you seemed to be on top ?
has to be heartbreaking when you 've held match points though .
you had some words of support i guess for andy hiring a female coach , and the girl you played today has a female coach also , tauziat . could you elaborate on that ? why do you think that can be a totally awesome choice for a player ?
do you think the standard here is improving ?
your plans now ? stay here and play doubles and then eastbourne ?
is this a big setback in your wimbledon preparations ?
any positives you can take out of today 's match , particularly that first set ?
( no microphone . )
how do you feel about being british no.1 ?
what 's it like just in general playing on a surface you probably did n't grow up on ? even being british it 's still a bit of a rare thing . how do you adjust ?
do you have any words of advice for johanna konta ? she plays aleksandra in the next round .
well done today . how did you feel you played ?
when you saw her in the draw , you obviously have a great record against her and you beat her last year , did n't you ? did that fill you with confidence straightaway ?
what are your hopes for this tournament and going forward into the grass court season ?
it 's heather next up , is n't it ?
if she wins today , it 's heather .
what are your thoughts on facing heather ? she 's a set up .
are you guys friends ?
i think it was a case that maybe your match could have been on center court today . did you feel like that should have been the case ?
can i ask you about aljaz bedene , the slovenian ...
yeah , slovenian chap that taking british nationality . your thoughts about that ? he 's going down not entirely the same road , but similar to you . do you think it 's good ? we should welcome him onto the davis cup team ?
why is britain so attractive to guys that maybe want to come take british nationality ?
it was a very big crowd . what was the atmosphere like ?
little bit of a slow start , but you seemed to get your grass legs under you pretty quickly . how did you feel overall ?
since the french open , i mean , how many days did you take off and how long have you been able to practice on grass ?
this tournament has gone from international level and now is a premier level . you 've been here before , what are some of the changes that you 've seen , upgrades ? what 's different ?
when you changed from clay to grass , what do you have to tell yourself to do ? occasionally players get strained muscles and so forth .
( no microphone . )
you hit a lot of winners . is that a good sign ?
you talked to us in stuttgart about working on your consistency , and everything else will take care of that , and also your game plan . what is your game plan now for grass ?
are you going to try a bit of doubles to improve that ?
surely not .
in general , what are your goals for this grass season ? it 's very short . it 's getting longer , but how big a part of the season is this ? i know that it 's your maybe least favorite surface and it 's such a short part of the season as well .
you went to the cricket the other day . are you a cricket fan ? you know a lot about the game ?
who was that ?
have you been around birmingham , anywhere else at all ?
it 's like that all the time in birmingham .
what 's the tougher transition to make : hard court to clay ? clay to grass ? or from grass back to hard ?
and one more question : if i say wimbledon , what 's the one memory you have , good or bad ?
were you star struck at the ball ? did you get to meet anybody ?
was it weird that you were a 16yearold junior in the final and she was 17 years old and had won it ?
what did you think meeting her that first time ?
well done today .
did it feel like you have never been away ?
what were you pleased with about your game most ? it all seemed to be working very well .
are you slightly irritated to lose your serve when you were serving at the end of the match ?
when you talk about a court that you like , that you come back to , and you have good positive , feelings , is that kind of a commentary of how important confidence is
when you play tennis ? is that what it is , you feel confident on that centre court and you produce that kind of tennis ?
with the grass obviously the ball bounces lower . has that been something that you 're pretty tall that you 've really had to adjust to , or is it just the way that you produce your shots , the low ball is in your strike zone ? why can you play so well on this surface ?
so do you see it as a positive thing that next year the grass season will be a little bit longer ?
is that because you like the surface and you 're good at playing on it , or does it also give the players a little bit more time to maybe not feel as much pressure ? with two weeks , sometimes you overplay and get injuries .
if we protract it out , is it just a little bit calmer period ?
just few words about belinda . in your opinion , what does she lack to be a champion ?
i guess you thought you had an opportunity to win that .
what are your plans now ? playing doubles ?
eastbourne quallies after that ?
what would it mean to you to get a wildcard in wimbledon ?
is it ? with regards to your career at the moment , is it just a case of getting enough money together to keep going ?
there were some comments flying around a few weeks ago andy said it maybe some of the top players filtering some of their prize money down the scale . you would be up for that , would you ?
and your dad has got both of you to worry about , so i guess it 's really difficult in your family situation .
has it come to the point where you felt this is more effort than it 's worth , or still hanging on to the dream ?
glad you 're still here .
well done . some people find it difficult to come to the grass here because it can be a bit damp and soft . you seem to have in problem at all ; is that right ?
there was an important time at perhaps 4all in the first set where she broke back , and you responded immediately with two good games . did you feel that was important ?
did you feel comfortable after that ?
you like grass , do n't you ? you 've won junior wimbledon on it . you 're going to play four weeks of grass court tennis now ?
although you ca n't play much on it , would it be your best surface , or one of your best surfaces ?
you 've had a really good 2014. have you surprised yourself with how well you 've done ? you 've rocketed up rankings .
did you expect to be ranked 77 so soon ?
do you think you may be surprising some players who obviously have never played against you before ? is that on your side ?
you play hantuchova in the next round . thoughts about that ? she 's a , can i say a fellow slovak ?
she 's also slovakian .
you 're noted as one of the most tactically astute players on the tour at the moments . there are a lot of compliments about your tactics . how will you change your tactics tomorrow to play hantuchova ?
have you seen her play in the past ?
any sort of ideas what your plan of attack may be ?
can you remember how old you were when you first saw daniela hantuchova play or when you became aware of her ?
is there any danger that you will be intimidated by her and by her reputation ?
i imagine you probably just want to enjoy your tennis and not think too far ahead and take it match by match and tournament by tournament , but are there any sort of dreams about what you might like to achieve that you could share with us in the longterm future ?
what 's it like playing here specifically at the classic , playing in birmingham ?
congratulations . you must be absolutely thrilled .
have you ever served better than that for an entire three sets ?
did you get a look at the clock registering the speed at all ?
several times it was over 120 and up to 126 .
there was a net cord that registered at 131 .
no , 131. up to the williamses ' level .
how did you keep up that intensity for three sets ?
what do you think she did in the second set to get back into it ? her returns ?
describe what it means to you to win your first title , wta title .
did it live up to your expectations at that moment ?
when you were envisioning this moment , did it involve the bottom of the trophy falling off ?
there are some very interesting names on that trophy . how does it feel to be one of them now ?
what did it mean to you to have martina hand you the trophy today ? have you spoken to her before ?
have you already looked at the wimbledon draw , and what are the expectations for the hopefully next two weeks ?
apart from the williams sisters , the last title for an american was won by melanie oudin in birmingham , and now you have won here and coco won in
when you first played here in the juniors three years ago , can you describe how alien grass felt at that point ? did you ever imagine your first title would come on this surface ?
what are your longterm ambitions on grass ?
where are you going to enjoy this win , here or london ?
( question about kerber 's serves not being fast on match points . ) did that kind of catch you off balance ?
seemed like you were coming in , stepping inside the court , coming to net a lot more in the third set . was that part of your decision to just throw caution to the wind ?
volleying , last year when i watched you , you did n't do it that much at all . have you been working on that , or is it spur of the moment ?
yesterday heather watson said that you were probably the toughest opponent she 's ever faced , and she thinks you 'll be a top10 player soon . do you see yourself being a top10 player ?
monday you 're going to be in the top 30. did you know that ?
welcome to the top 30 .
do you think other players are going to fear you a bit more now ? they will look at your name and think , i really do n't want to be playing madison now ?
how difficult is it going to be to sort of put this out of your mind and focus on wimbledon ?
this week takes something out of you physically , no doubt , and maybe mentally , as well . how will you manage that sort of recovery process ? because you 've only got three days before your match at wimbledon .
have you spoken to anyone back home , your parents ?
did you ever doubt that you would be able to close it out at love30 ? you 've had matches before where you had opponents on the ropes . was there any doubt ?
some good prize money . do you plan to treat yourself to buy anything ? how are you going to treat yourself afterwards ?
what are your plans for the bottle of champagne ?
congratulations . it was a terrific final . you must feel a little bit battered with her serve and the groundstrokes ?
how hard was it coping with the serve ?
how good is she and how good is she going to be , do you think ?
heather says she expects her to get into the top 10 and will be disappointed if she does n't . do you see that ?
do you think the call with match point made you lose a little bit of focus ?
you had a couple of calls that went against you . how frustrating was that ?
does it make you appreciate hawkeye when you have a match like that ?
when you lost in the final before you seemed just kind of devastated . i remember you found it quite hard to talk after the match . you seem much more positive this time .
did you try to change your tactics throughout the match , or did you just focus on executing what you were doing better ?
what 's your schedule now from here to wimbledon ?
tougher than you expected ?
talk a little about wimbledon for us , now that you 've finished here .
shahar peer .
you always seem to get very tough battles against each other . today you looked a bit tired in the first set .
it seemed like you came to the net quite a lot in the first set , but after the first set you were n't able to do that so much . was that a result of ...
you clearly enjoy coming here . you 've got a good record here . in a couple years ' time , there is this new grass court tournament in mallorca the same week as birmingham . what if any effect do you think it will have on this tournament ?
the courts here are very good quality , are n't they ?
what will your preparations be between now and monday ?
friday .
you 'll travel back to london today ?
after all your recent travails you seem very relaxed and happy .
make you stronger , things like this ?
she hits a bit of a hard ball , does n't she ?
how would you sum up your week here ? what are your feelings about what you 've achieved ?
do you feel you 're playing your best tennis , getting back to where you were when you reached 39 in the rankings ?
did you have a chance to look at the wimbledon draw ?
have you played her before ?
are you more confident going into wimbledon this year than you were last ?
was that all part of the glandular fever last wimbledon ?
talk a bit about wimbledon and looking forward to it .
you 're playing doubles with genie bouchard . is this the first time you have played together ?
what are your first memories of wimbledon seen on tv ?
regarding genie , how is it that partnership came about ? when and where did you agree to team up ?
how good do you think keys is going to be ?
how do you play somebody that powerful ? i mean , do you have to psych yourself in a different way in the match ? because the shots just come at you like bullets , do n't they ?
you have heard players say that she was just too good today . what do you tell yourself to motivate yourself for that type of match ?
you sure it was n't because you were avoiding jumping in the sea ?
congratulations . good day for you ?
how does it feel to be in your first final ?
what do you feel about your game today ?
playing angelique kerber tomorrow , what are your thoughts on that match ?
you have climbed the rankings very quickly in the last 18 months . have you surprised yourself how well it 's gone for you ?
obviously your first final . how nervous do you think you 're going to be and how much of an issue are you anticipating having to manage your nerves ?
do you feel like the underdog ?
have you given yourself any time to think about wimbledon while all of this has been going on ?
not even looked at the draw ?
no ?
do you know that you hit a 123mileperhour serve in that match ?
is that the fastest serve you have ever hit , i 'm guessing ?
were you looking for that to be a strong weapon for you ?
are you comfortable on grass ?
have you a background in grasscourt play at home ?
it 's your favorite surface ?
was the first time you played on grass here in the junior competition ?
it 's been a good week for you .
it 's going to be madison keys in the final . what are your thoughts on that match ?
how much is what happened here in the final two years ago still ingrained in your memory ? because you had match points .
do you see this as good preparation for wimbledon ?
you 're quite happy to go so far and certainly traveling down to london and starting on perhaps monday ?
there 's nothing like winning .
did you have a chance to look at the draw at wimbledon ?
you always play tough matches with caroline . how do you prepare yourself to step on court when you know it 's going to be a tough battle ?
your physical fitness is pretty impressive . how important a part is that for you when you know that you 're going to face an opponent like caroline who is going to make you hit a lot of balls ?
you made a massive jump up the rankings obviously like two , three years ago . was that connected to taking a different attitude to your fitness ?
you have always had really good results on grass . how do you feel after a whole week practicing and winning matches ?
how does it feel today ?
that was exactly the kind of workout you wanted , was n't it , leading into wimbledon ?
the interruption , how did that affect you ?
it 's unusual , after they removed the spectators , you then went inside .
what did you make of your opponent 's reaction at the end when she did n't even sort of look at you at the net and then walked off ?
you had one or two questionable calls again ?
you made a point to put the ball where ...
was that the point of putting the ball down , like , that 's where you need to look ?
what 's the angriest you have ever gotten with a line call ? do you remember ?
would you introduce hawkeye on every court across the game ?
will you be watching the football tonight ?
you know we will be asking you about it tomorrow .
tell us about your semifinal . kerber .
it 's working very well towards next week , is n't it , stepping up each time ?
i think the eastbourne crowd would quite like to see you play heather in the finals .
is it fair to say that you 're serving harder now than you have been in the last few months ? i was looking at the speed gun , and there were serves like 110 , much more than usual .
bad luck . what 's the problem ? how serious is it ?
have you seen the medics yet ? have they passed an opinion on it , how serious it might be ?
have you pulled out of this match to make sure you 're ready for wimbledon ?
how many days are you going to take off ? obviously you 'll head up to london now , i guess .
when did you start feeling the pain ?
yes .
how are you feeling ? are you disappointed ?
would you consider yourself doubtful for wimbledon at this stage ?
is grass a difficult surface to play on if you do have a strain ?
it 's ironic that you should get an injury like that when the weather at eastbourne is at its best for some years in terms of the tennis , no wind and warm sunshine .
if it still feels this sore tomorrow , do you think you can still practice with it , perhaps some limited hitting ?
did you say you 're heading to london tomorrow ?
when was the first time you felt something in your hamstring ? was it just today ?
nice and quick ?
did you get as much out of it as you wanted , looking ahead ?
righthanded players do n't often like playing lefthanded players . how do lefthanded players feel about playing a lefty ?
what are the big improvements you feel you have made in your game the last year ?
you seem to like the grass .
do you remember your first experience on grass ?
so your memories of eastbourne do n't include , oh , my god , the wind ?
what are your aspirations for wimbledon ?
do you feel good in your head about wimbledon ?
you said you enjoy coming back here . anything in particular you enjoy about coming here ?
are you looking forward to an extra week of grass next year ?
players always say they take one match at a time . is it ever difficult to not think about winning a tournament , whether it be here or when you go to wimbledon and you 're a top seed ?
some of the players have been struggling a bit today , but you seemed to have a pretty easy time .
what were you most pleased about with your game today ?
you 're now i think 5love against sloane . what is it that works so well for you against her or that does n't work for her ?
certain players , they see the draw , see certain opponents . do you feel comfortable against some of them and maybe others where you think you have had maybe bad experiences in the past ? do you get that sense ?
you 're playing an opponent next who has played about five hours of tennis in the last couple days . do you think that will be an advantage to you ? she may be aching and tired ?
where do you think you are with your game at this moment , what level ?
your best form for a while ?
a world cup question for you . being a liverpool fan , england is playing against uruguay tomorrow .
five to one ?
is that going to be the score , you think ?
did you ask for an early match ?
we were still here at 9:00 last night .
the match will keep you away from the party tomorrow night ?
care to give us a prediction for the score of tomorrow 's match ? the football , not yours .
careful .
we think of you as part of the generation which kind of also includes like azarenka and radwanska . obviously at the moment we 've got older players right at the top of the rankings with serena and li na , but we 're also seeing a lot of younger players coming through . do you feel like there is a danger that 's sort of you and your generation , players might get kind of squeezed out in the middle between the veterans and the young ones ?
does it give you hope though that you have players like li na and serena still playing very , very well into their 30s in terms of looking long term ?
rolling stones said they would n't play after they were 30 .
what do you think of raheem sterling ?
is he your new favorite ?
( indiscernible . )
congratulations . is that one of your biggest wins , first top20 player ?
does it give you a lot of confidence to beat a top20 player to carry forward into other matches ?
you have had two long matches , but after a disappointing sort of early exit in birmingham , do you feel that you are enjoying the time to get some match play on grass now ?
your interaction with your coach , it 's always fascinating to watch where coaches either are bombarding people with information or there is no eye contact . there seemed to be very softly spoken advice and good interaction . can you talk a little bit about that .
you seemed to be upset by a line call early in the second set , a baseline call . do you use that anger and challenge your game to make you more focused ?
do you feel like you 're in the form of your life at the moment ? a top20 victory , and you 're playing so well . do you feel like you 're playing the best tennis of your career ?
you were aggressive out there , particularly in the deciding set . is that something that diego has tried to work with you a lot and tried to bring into your game ?
you must be big news in guernsey , are n't you ? give us a feel for how much interest your career has had there .
last year you said that people usually underrate you a bit on grass because of your game . now you got your biggest career win on grass . are you thinking people will realize you 're a better player on grass than they believe ?
a win like this will get the british public very excited about wimbledon coming up . is that something you enjoy and you sort of look forward to , the big challenge of wimbledon ?
not a lot of ranking points to defend the rest of the season . do you feel like this could be a spring board for climbing up into the top 50 and maybe improving ?
you mentioned that you want to get more aggression into your game . are you , as a person , are you naturally aggressive ?
so close . must be tough to lose a match like that .
you had the momentum . what turned it around after the first set ?
were you disappointed to be out on court 2 ?
it 's just that a lot of the local people were complaining they could n't see and watch you . they were very keen to watch their local girl .
would you have preferred centre court , given the choice ?
were you distracted at all by giorgi 's actions ? was that a distraction to you or were you able to focus ?
was the wind a problem ? it got quite blustery .
when you have a match and you have a match point like that , do you beat yourself up on that or do you just forget about it ?
how would you sum up the week for you ?
are you happy with your form going into wimbledon ?
you looked very sharp today , even though you lost .
it could have gone either way .
what will you do ? will you stay at home a bit or go straight up to london or wimbledon ?
you have certainly justified getting the wildcard , have n't you ? you win a match and you come so close to winning a second one . that 's good , you know , that you can say to the organizers , thank you for the wildcard , but you have lived up to your part of the bargain ?
is it tempting to stay at home during wimbledon and commute ?
if you stayed down here , would you still be able to use the courts , the practice courts ?
what are your thoughts on the singles ?
what are your memories of when you went to wimbledon to defend your title ? how was that ?
how do you think it will be for andy this year ?
how is that victory ?
did you count the match points ?
were you nervous during them ?
how does that result stand on your table of achievements ?
nothing more than that ?
she 's very highly ranked , is n't she ? world no.1 junior ?
your family here ?
how do you feel your form is going into wimbledon ? how do you feel you 're playing ?
with matches like that today , do you kind of go into them with a slightly different mindset now ? do you really sort of feel like , well , i can win this , and you 're hoping to win ?
i 'm just wondering with the progress you have made up the rankings , does that give you a bit more confidence than you might have had before going into a match like that ?
are you hoping to get on centre court in the next round ?
do you feel you 're going in the right direction , the rate of your progress , your lift up the rankings ? are you happy with that ?
are you doing anything different ? have you changed anything in your training or in your game ?
i saw you play in vancouver last year . how would you compare the way you 're playing right now to when you were in vancouver last year ?
do you set yourself goals as far as the rankings go , top 100 and by the end of the year or anything like that ?
can you share some of those goals with us ?
the crowd are very close to you on court no.2 . did you appreciate the home support ? was it nice to play in your hometown and with the home support ?
just tell us your mother 's and father 's names .
well , you mentioned they are here . it 's nice to call them by their names rather than `` mom '' and `` dad . ''
welcome back to grass .
very nice win obviously today . second top10 win of your career . a pretty nondrama one , i think . what are your thoughts about that match ?
she was getting really angry . do you kind of pay attention to that when they get mad ? are you thinking , yeah , keep getting mad ? or do you just focus on yourself ?
you had a tough match , a very close match against sara errani in paris who could be seen as a similar player as jankovic , plays a similar sort of game . what made the difference between that match and this match ? the surface ? was it that you were having a good day ?
i remember seeing you train with john evert when you were smaller . when did you first get on a grass court ? they do n't have many in america . when did you first get on a grass court ?
and you liked it instantly , did you ? or did you take time to adjust ?
what do you tell yourself when you transition from clay and you step on grass for the first time for practicing ? technically or tactically what changes in your mind ?
you 're obviously still a very young player . do you still feel like a newcomer on the tour or do you feel like you 've started to find your feet and it 's what you 're used to now ?
a lot of your generation are looking good . do you feel like there 's a new wave in the women 's game ? are you friends with your sort of rivals , teenagers at that sort of age ?
a lot of times it seems like players find their second year on the tour harder than the first year because the first year is new and everything that you achieve is exciting and it 's never happened before . are you finding it more difficult this year now that you have things to defend ?
are there any particular moments you can point to that have been , you know , tough ones for you this year ?
what helps you to keep perspective when you 're going through those , when you 're , you know , back in the locker room after a tough match ?
do you like england ?
where would it rank ?
have you tried any english food ?
( indiscernible . )
how late did you stay up last night ? did you watch the soccer game at all ?
you watched to the end or you went to bed ?
is that the first football game you have watched ?
it 's been interesting seeing a lot of americans who do n't really watch football watching it . some people are , that 's dumb . are you one of those people ?
what 's your favorite sport besides tennis ?
what 's more violent , american football or european football ?
you must be very pleased the way you played so long for so long .
what were you most pleased about with your performance today ?
you were struggling with your serve a little bit . when you lost your serve serving for the match , how nervous were you ?
how big a win is this for you in your career ?
what are you going to take from today moving forward ?
do you like grass as a surface ?
why ?
do you know anything about your next opponent , johanna konta ?
have you played her before ?
you were returning very close to the service line today . was it a choice you did before the match ?
the crowd seemed to get behind you today . how did that feel ?
is that the longest match you have ever been involved in ? have you had a longer match ?
was that more of a workout than you wanted in your first match back ?
you 're happy with the way you competed , obviously ?
so what do you think you need to work on now ?
because grass is such a specialized surface , is it the most tricky , you think , to come back to having been out of the game for as long as you have ?
you 've got one of the biggest tournaments of the year up next . would it be good to have another slightly smaller tournament to work your way back , or are you happy to go into the grand slam ?
is feeling confident a big part of recovering from an injury ? your foot is okay now ?
what were you particularly happy about in terms of like specific things in your game today that maybe exceeded your expectations or surprised you that you were able to do ?
what are your expectations now going to wimbledon ? are you looking forward to just getting the match play done and as far as you go that 's great , or do you still have that desire to pull off an amazing run and win wimbledon ?
you had a horrible fall last year . does that play into your mind going into wimbledon this year ?
what will you do between here and wimbledon ? will you go straight up there today ?
you had to work hard for that , did n't you ?
you had some benefit from home support . the crowd was behind you , especially with that questionable call .
are you happy to have battled your way back in both sets ? you were behind in both and you came back in both . does that give you a sense of where your game might be at and how good your attitude is at the moment , as well ?
can you remember the last time you played somebody who has been a top10 player for a while and also a grand slam winner in a first round of a tournament ?
a good advert for the miami tourist board to get away for a few days and come back in form like that ?
how important was that break to put the disappointment of the french and everything that preceded it behind you ?
do you actually feel as physically strong as you have for quite some time ? you certainly look as though you are , but do you feel as though you 're physically as strong as you have been ?
are you playing with no discomfort at all at the moment ? are you having to do anything extra to make sure nothing else crops up ?
you said you had a clear mind . do you feel you 're mentally stronger than you have been ?
given your game , do you think you have underachieved at wimbledon over the years and do you think this year we might see even more from you there ?
besides winning the title , what would you consider a good result at wimbledon as this process restarts for you ?
you must have thought you had your chances out there .
it 's not often you get an opponent of that quality in the first round .
is there anything in particular that you think let you down today and against casey as well last week ?
how are you feeling on the grass ?
how do you approach wimbledon now ? you have the encouragement of the french open plus stuff to work on from the last few weeks here .
can you talk about your serve ? can you talk a little bit about the strategy you and miles go through , depending on your opponent , the surface , how you set up your strategy and your tactics for the match ?
and is your serve a big part of that ?
having miles now and his experience with grass , has that helped you change your approach this year , or is there anything new that you may not have done in previous years ?
you have one of the best serves on tour , but you have been struggling a lot to get the results you get from the other surfaces on grass . how do you think that 's happening ?
do you look forward to wimbledon ? do you get excited like you would , say , for a french open ? or is it a little bit anxiety because of the surface ?
do you think that next year , you 're going to have an extra week on grass , that 's going to help the players who are not natural grass courters ?
what are your thoughts on that ? tough one .
she 's a very , very good grass court player . is it just adjusting , getting used to the surface again ?
you have lost your first match in eastbourne the last two years , as well , but then have gone on to do very , very well at wimbledon . is one match on grass all you need ?
what will your preparations be now ?
where will you practice ?
what do you like to work on most for grass ?
congratulations .
what was the key for you tonight ?
you were stretching your groin on the chair and had your right thigh strapped . is the body just starting to feel those matches a bit ?
your first final , and it did not appear you had any nerves at all closing it out . did you feel nervous in the last game ?
you were emotional during the ceremony telling your mom and dad this is the first trophy and all that . talk about your emotions . you cried a little bit .
you were saying obviously you 've gone through a lot to get here , eight years on tour and i think over 200 tournaments without a title . did you ever think about giving at all ?
i guess this is obviously the most ideal preparation leading into next week . you 're in venus williams ' half of the draw . do you consider yourself a dark horse now ?
you said a big part of what you worked on was the mental side of things . obviously today winning your first title , how much of that improvement in your mental side of your game do you attribute to coming to this point and now winning a title ?
at what point this week did you think , maybe i can win this tournament ? looking back you beat errani , you beat kvitova , you beat kerber . it was n't like you beat easy players . you beat all very good quality players .
in the errani match and a couple other matches beforehand , i notice that you hit a lot of slice forehands . i did n't see that much tonight . was that a conscious thing or not a conscious thing ?
i know it 's only just happened , but how do you think this title might affect you this season ? great confidence ? could open the floodgates ? do you look at the year differently now ?
sort of a cliche , but now that you won the title , does it make all the pain you went through worth it ?
congratulations .
first final . talk us through . obviously did n't freeze up at the end . nerves did n't come in the all ?
you were asked on court about how your body was holding up . i notice you had your thigh bandaged . is that just a precaution ?
you spoke to us yesterday about how relaxed you feel this season . you 're in the final . there will be some nerves . but will you try and take that relaxation into the final ?
seven wins is normally a grand slam .
here you are in your first final . it 's a milestone for you . how do you describe it yourself ?
you 're the first qualifier to make it through to the final . we 've had qualifiers in the semifinals but not in the women 's final before . does that make you feel as though you 've made your milestone and it 's something quite significant ?
a little earlier del potro was talking about speed of courts being quite fast . would it be fair to say that they suit you fairly well ? seems they 're very quick , and i note that you had most of your very good results you had some good results at wimbledon over the years . done well there on the faster courts . would that be fair to say ?
can you tell us a little bit , your sort of ranking has gone up and down a little bit . have you had some injuries in previous years ? other factors with your ranking going up and down ?
talk about madison and angelique . i know you 've played angelique before . talk about both girls .
must be disappointed , but she was very , very consistent . is that the main thing that got you in trouble today ? just kept getting every ball back .
last time you played together did you notice a big change ? do something a bit different ?
no , no , her .
del potro was saying that these courts are fast and playing like grass . do you feel that way ?
so you came back in the second set . you were down 41 , you came back , and then played one sort of loose game and then it got away from you ?
you played hopman cup and here . i suppose you got as much as you can . you made semifinal here , australian open campaign . talk about how you feel right now . i know you 're disappointed .
are you saying the result does n't matter that much going into a grand slam , it 's more your form and how you feel you 're hitting the ball ?
would you rather have this kind of court speed in melbourne , too ? is this the court speed you want ?
we do n't really know .
a nice way to start the year , a final already ?
you enjoy the conditions out there ? a little bit ad nauseam , but seems to be quite fast courts out there , and a few of the players have mentioned that . the players going through have said they enjoyed the fast courts . that 's obviously something that suits your game .
you were a semifinalist last year and now in the final . what is the difference in your game in the last 12 months ?
did you have a chance to see any of the earlier match ? i suppose you might have expected to meet petra in the final , but it 's not .
do you know much about pironkova ? she is outside the top 100 now . you might not have even played her last season . i 'm not sure what you know about her coming into the final .
it was a little bit of a slow start today . what did you do to turn in around in the first set ?
she 's a very powerful player , but it seemed like you dictated most of the match , which is not easy to do against her .
you were talking about going for your shots a lot last year . maybe you did n't do it as much . in the offseason did you change something to get the mentality so you could really be more offense this year ?
so no nerves when you 're going for your shots ? if you miss a couple you just say , okay , i 'm going to play defense again ?
so i guess you think if you do that you 'll reach all of your goals , because you need more offense to play with the top 5 players consistently ?
are you someone that likes a lot of matches before a grand slam ? i think we see with some of the players you kind of get the feeling that sometimes a couple of rounds into some of these leadup events they 're not so interested . a minor injury , they pull out , or you think they 've got their eyes on the grand slam coming up . are you someone that enjoys playing a lot of matches and are happy to get through to a final and then back it up straightaway at a grand slam ?
i just wanted to ask you , did you enjoy the support from the sydney crowd today ?
how hard is it to play your fed cup teammate , soulmate , a friend , whatever ?
why are czech players always lefthanded ? martina , and you and lucie . what 's with the lefthanders in the czech republic ?
couple of top seeds have gone down here . were you a bit nervous going into today 's game ?
early on in the second set you seemed to be having a laugh with your coach . can you tell us what that was about ?
just wanted to ask you if you have any particular mentality going up against another left hander ?
i 'm sure you were looking forward to the match . kind of disappointed it ended that way ?
you 've had a good week this week . coming in last week a little bit tough in the first round , but it seems like you found your form , yeah ? talk about that .
you 're now through to the semifinals . how much confidence has this week given you to take forward next week regardless of what happens from here on ?
what do you know about who you 'll be playing next ? will you watch the match ?
how much progress do you feel like you 've made in your game in the offseason ? obviously at your age you expect to improve quite rapidly . do you feel like that 's what 's happening with you ?
i was n't going to asking anything , but i 'll just ask , you 're a big hitter and you have a big serve . do you feel you 've got the makings for top 5 or even higher sometime soon ?
either of those players well , suarez does n't really play like kerber , but if you get someone like kerber , the veteran players kind of grind you . radwanska i know is a different type of player but likes move you around . maybe that 's one of the challenges this year , figuring out how to beat the veteran players and stay in there with them ?
how big was that mentally for you to pull out the tiebreak over the 18yearold croatian the other day ? that was a long , backcourt match .
every year in australia there are some players who have made more progress in the offseason than others . they sometimes catch more experienced players napping . jelena jankovic was an obvious one who started really well a few years ago and took that through the season and ended up as no.1 . sloane stevens has come through well here ; li na a few years ago as well . do you feel like there 's an opportunity for you to make some good gains in the rankings by getting off to a flying start in australia ?
obviously the match momentum is what comes first and the ranking follows that . you do n't to think about the ranking . if you win enough matches , that automatically happens , right ?
what did you think of your match today ?
you win the tiebreak and the whole match turns around , no ? take us through the tiebreaker .
fourth one you had a chance .
so your shoulder is completely good ? seems like on your first serve it you 're ending it well ; other times you 're a little hesitant .
does two matches give you enough preparation for the australian open ? how will you structure the rest of the week ?
in order for you to go as deep australia want in melbourne , what 's got to happen for you gamewise ?
is thomas giving you much different advice than your dad or is it just little tiny things ?
but the communication with him is good because you 've known him since you were very young ?
you started 3love down in the first set . you came back and won it 64. what was the turnaround for you in the opening set and on through the match ?
there has been a huge raft of upsets in the women 's draws . what are your thoughts on that ? does that help you going forward ?
what level do you think your own play is at at the moment ? are you playing as well as you can or close ?
you play petra next . i imagine you know each other 's games very well .
what do you expect from that match ?
did you see her match today ?
obviously not a great day out there for you . was your shoulder giving you problems ?
obviously she gave you a lot of problems at the australian open last year with threehour match i think you said yesterday . so you knew what it would be like to play her today . what was it that you were unable to do today to get the match done ?
obviously you had such a great run into the australian open last year , a big winning streak . totally different this time around . how is the sort of confidence levels now heading to melbourne ?
still believe you can contend in melbourne then , contend for the title ?
will you need any treatment for your shoulder ? i 'm not clear , did it bother you at all today ? is it still a bit sore ?
what will you do between now and the start of the australian open ? go to melbourne and start practicing ? what 's the plan for the rest of week ?
congratulations on today 's win . you struggled here when you arrived last year . seems you 've arrived this year in very good form . how do you assess how you 're going at this stage ?
i talked to christina , and she said unlike at indian wells when you played her , it seemed like today you were on top of every ball very fast . did you feel that way ?
so in the offseason you were working more on what , fitness i would assume , then focusing on every point and then , what , serve or ...
this is the first time you 've had a long period with your new fitness trainer . you had two months with him this time . you feel like you 're legitimately faster movementwise ?
what are your goals for this season ?
we 've seen the top seed and the fourth seed go out in the last 24 hours of this tournament . how important is it to start well ? you did n't start well last year . how important is it going into melbourne to actually feel like you have some form before you get there ?
i was in brisbane , and the players were saying that that was the fastest outdoor hard court they had ever played on . do you find sydney playing very fast ? is it faster than perth ?
so you feel like it plays in your favor , even though the fast surface is outdoors ? i know you like indoors a lot and grass , but you like an outdoor fast surface because you can dictate points easier ?
i think you got on court today while radek was playing , correct ? and then you were off court before he finished . was that because you wanted to see the end of his match ?
did you tell him later , how come you were so slow finishing ?
took a while to get going out there . what was happening ?
how easy has it been for you concentrate on tennis the last week given the very exciting event in your life ?
as another sporting champion , rory himself , how much can he help you with your game and what are your plans together ? have you discussed potentially getting back to world no.1 in this momentous year or any of that ?
did you have any inkling that he was going to ask you to marry him on new year 's eve ?
why did he choose sydney as the venue ?
why did he choose , do you know ? did he tell you why ?
so the second best way would be for you to win the australian open tennis after he won the australian open ?
you look very fit . you look like the fittest we 've seen you at this tournament . have you been doing something different in the offseason with your strength and conditioning ?
so nothing different ?
you are working out with a new coach . how is that going ?
what did you make of that ? things got pretty tight in the second set . couple of set points . a little bit unlucky there .
overall how are you feeling with yourself and your game ?
a mixed afternoon and the doubles . rather take the singles win than the doubles ?
what are your plans for 2014 ? i mean , with ranking where it 's at , what do you do to chip away at it and get back into the top 100 and go from there ?
does it get the monkey off your back a little bit ?
were you very nervous at the beginning when you were missing all the forehands ?
how important was the first set ? did you feel like you broke her ?
in the last two finals you did win the first set , but lost in three . did you ever think about that at all ?
what was going through your mind in the middle of the first set when things got a little bit tight ? you could see you were getting a bit nervous . what were you thinking ?
was it hard to keep swinging on your forehand in that first set ?
you did n't really celebrate when you won . was it because you were relieved ? what was the feeling ?
you are the oldest winner of this tournament . how proud are you of that record ?
our sport had few top stars who are funny . when did you realize that you were funny ? talk about the joy of making jokes . does your husband ever say , that 's enough ?
but you like to hear people laugh ?
dominika said you came out and dictated play . did you feel like your aggressive game plan was effective ?
yes , today .
compare this win with roland garros . you always said that the french open was maybe too fast , unexpected . this one you 've been chasing for three times now .
not many people win grand slams after saving match points in a match . are you proud of that , as well ?
you made a lot of changes in your game . you said it was because you wanted to be a better player , a great player . is this a great reward for that , that you made the right choices ?
you 're only 11 points from azarenka , no.2 in the rankings . is that your next goal or do you have others ?
you 've won two of the four grand slam titles . is it realistic for you to win all four in your career ?
is it a target for you now to win wimbledon and the u.s. ?
you said max eisenbud made you very rich .
how do you think he did it ?
you had a bit of a tough time after winning the french open . do you feel now you 're much more ready to deal with this ?
when you decided to hire carlos , did you genuinely believe that you would be here , or did it take time to believe it actually ?
you prepared everything very well . do you prepare also your speeches or do you just go there and they come as they come ?
carlos was here 10 years ago with the champion justine . did he have any special advice for you today ?
you 're making money for three or four generations for your family . where do you put all this money ?
where do you go from here ? such a high . do you go back to china , back home for a couple days ?
does your mom watch the matches ?
what are the chinese characters on your tshirt ?
you talked about making the changes to your game . do you feel like you can still improve in your game , other changes you can make ?
if you had to summarize the two weeks in one word or one phrase , what would that be ?
your toughest moment in the training , when was that ?
you stayed so competitive in the first set . give us an idea what happened in the second .
how proud are you of yourself right now ?
of the two players , you seemed the least nervous in the first set . did you feel that she might have been a little nervous ?
in the presentation ceremony , you looked very calm . was that an act or were you able to think that it was a great moment ?
how do you think your life might change ?
on the stand there was chris evert . li na , as well . do you sense she 's a special personality ?
what did you feel was the difference between you and li ?
you have germany in the fed cup . do you see that as a chance to have a homecoming ?
what did you do to prepare for the match today ? how did you spend your day ?
when you were walking through the corridors , it looked like you were trying to stop yourself from smiling . how much did you enjoy that moment ?
how much confidence does this give you for the future ?
do you feel you can win a grand slam ?
is it going to be a challenge , domi , to keep the tennis at this level so you 'll be a force at every grand slam and wta event ?
does this change your expectation leading into something like roland garros ?
chris evert said she was impressed by your work ethic . what value did you get from spending time at her academy ?
many great players lose a grand slam final before they win one . how much do you think you learned from this two weeks ?
playing the fourth seed of the tournament , did you get an idea of what you need to do with your own game to get into the top 10 ?
have you spoken to your parents yet ?
what did she say ?
you 're famous for your activities after the finals . in sandiego you slid into the water . in palo alto
what are you going to do here ?
what 's the best way to celebrate in bratislava ?
will you make sure your parents are here next year just in case ?
why did n't your parents watch the match ?
were you flat ? was it just a bad day at the office ? were you not fully fit ?
she played well , but was there a sense that you could get into it ?
did you know you were feeling a bit flat going into the match ?
you 've played a semifinal before in a grand slam . how did that help you prepare for today ?
you do sometimes start slowly . did you ever get a sense that it was starting to come and it just did n't develop ?
maybe this is a difficult question , but is this loss tougher for you than the one at wimbledon ?
what lesson will you have learned in this tournament that can help you in the future ?
is this a positive tournament for you as you leave ? do you consider it a good one ? are you considering it a bad one ?
you 've had a lot of long matches . the way you play means sometimes you have to wear your opponents down . does that mean an area you have to work on is not fitness , but the ability to recover from a threeset match ?
did you get a chance to see any of the highlights from yesterday 's match ?
did you see a favorite shot that you hit yesterday ?
how was the match today ?
12 years difference in age . do you think the experience helped you ?
the second set could have gone either way . a few tight service games for both of you . what were you telling yourself ?
you 've had such good results over the past four years . does it feel easy at this point going out there for a grand slam semifinal ?
less nervous than your first one ?
how do you feel about going into another australian open final having been there before ? what do you learn from those times to this time ?
are you surprised , as some of us are , that cibulkova is now winning 61 , 40 versus radwanska ?
this score , is this something you would expect or something astonishing ?
if you play cibulkova , how do you prepare ?
when you were younger , you did something courageous . to the federation , you said you will set your own schedule , keep the prize money , travel . is that something you 're proud of ? would you be here now if you had n't done that ?
if you win here , will you send safarova a note or give her a part of your prize money ?
do you think you 're playing maybe calmer with that match being so close to maybe being at the airport ?
so do you feel lucky here this year ?
this will be your fourth grand slam final . first time you probably go in as a favorite by the rankings . how will that feel different for you ?
you are already the most famous tennis player from asia of all time . is that important for you ? does it give you a lot of satisfaction ? do you know that michael chang , chinese background , he won only one slam , and you may have a chance to win two .
but the family background .
if you were n't a tennis player , how would you be famous ?
the player you probably will play in the final is from slovakia , four million people . when things were tough and difficult and you did not feel love , did you ever think to yourself that maybe it would be better to come from a smaller country than china ?
carlos was saying you 've been visualizing , imagining , to stay calm and focused at this tournament .
what are you visualizing ?
how come a player as successful as you are only one year ago was thinking maybe to retire ? before wimbledon you said something like you would like to stop . is that true ?
how do you explain it ?
are you satisfied with the results in this australian open ?
what did you say to yourself when you went down love5 so quickly ?
were you nervous at the beginning of the match ?
set point down in the first round on court 15 to this , have you exceeded your own expectations ?
after 5love down you played pretty even with her for a while . any reason you could n't sort of quite turn it ?
a year ago when you did n't have great success here , if someone came up to you and said , do n't worry , you 'll make the semis next year , what would you have thought ?
what 's the one single best thing that nick brings to you as a person and a player ?
was today 's match different than playing a normal match ?
did you feel tighter , more weight on your shoulders ?
this is a fairly big deal at home . have you been feeling that in any way , been able to sense that ?
which way do you think it will change your life as a tennis player ?
how excited were you to get a tweet from justin bieber ?
what do you take away from this tournament ? selfconfidence ? experience ?
back in montral , did you ever play for the team at the private school you went to ?
there 's been a lot of compliments on what you 've accomplished here . are there any in particular you 've heard of from somebody that you respect that left a mark with you ?
what is your goal as a tennis player , including winning a grand slam ?
if you could choose one of the four slams , which one would you most like to hold up the trophy for ?
do you think this success will change your life and you will get more endorsements ?
can you explain the gift .
who named it sheila ?
it 's been a long time since you beat her , you 've had struggles against her . seemed like today you had more faith in yourself .
you 're praised with being very intelligent on court with your tactics . how did you break this down , what was your game plan going out there technically ?
did you notice at some point that her forehand was off , that she was n't having her best day ?
you did n't lose confidence after the second set even though the last game was not great for you . did you tell yourself something between sets to stay there strong ?
how good does it feel to reach a semifinal here , having played so many quarterfinals ?
you 've made it to the semis and a final at wimbledon . what did you learn from those defeats that will help you this time around in the latter stages of a major like this ?
what do you think about your opponent for the semifinal and how do you prepare for that ?
you seem fairly calm now . you sent a tweet that was just exclamation points after you won .
how excited are you to finally beat her now ?
are you going to go back and watch it a few times ?
keep the dvd for the future ?
you hit some pretty incredible shots . there were some good rallies in the third set . what was the favorite one that you hit ?
you had the very difficult loss to lisicki at wimbledon . talk about the process of putting those big losses behind you and looking to the future .
how important was it for you to use a lot of variety today ? in the past when you 've lost to her , you would get stuck in a lot of baseline rallies . how important was it to mix it up like you did today ?
do you have any favorite color you wear for success ?
not white , red , black ?
you are a great shotmaker . you have great anticipation . how do you read your opponent 's serve and shots ? how is it possible ?
you do n't show too much emotion on court . are there more things going on inside you or do you just feel like you need to stay calm or you 're not going to play well ?
can you win the australian open ?
do you like the fast courts ? does that help your game ?
do you think you 've learned something from wimbledon last year where , again , the draw kind of blew up , serena lost early , a bunch of top seeds lost early , it looked like a great opportunity ? it seems like a little bit of the same situation here this year . did you learn from that experience of taking it one match at a time , ca n't look at the trophy ?
do you remember the first time you met and played cibulkova ? must have been a long time ago .
do you remember who won or what the match was like ?
you were both like this tall ( indicating very short ) ?
were you still pretty much the same players back then : you with the variety , her short but powerful ?
i believe you 're always saying you push yourself quite a lot in the offseason back in poland . do n't you have the fear you wo n't be able to recover in time for the new season ? how do you balance that ?
you did university in the winter ?
how important is mental toughness at this stage of the tournament ?
after playing such a good match against jelena did you find it hard to recover for today ?
would you say it was a lack of experience ?
you expect to be at this level for many years from now on . does n't that relax you a little bit , thinking , okay , this is not my only chance ? i will have many .
what do you take out of today moving forward ? there will be other opportunities . what do you learn today that you can use next time ?
you came here without a coach , right ?
i heard that you may be wim fissette that worked with clijsters ?
how did you meet him ?
so you have n't met yet ?
do you feel you lacked the support , the guidance to prepare you for today ?
again , on your future coach , what do you know about him ?
you had a great tournament . you must be happy on reflection of the first four rounds .
how pleased are you to be able to back up such a good victory against sharapova ?
your opponent , she said she did n't really feel like she was mentally ready for the occasion . did you feel the difference out there today ?
your other grand slam semifinal appearances , how are you a different player now ?
you mentioned not being favored . your record against agnieszka or victoria says you wo n't be favored in the semis . do you like that ?
you 've had tough losses and big wins against both of them . how does that affect you going into this match ?
you played a really good match today . was it your intention to go out and be so aggressive from the start ?
is n't that the same thing when you play vika or agnieszka , you have to bring something unexpected ?
how have you learned to put big losses behind you ? if you look at your rivalries with both of them , how do you put those behind you and move on ?
how important was your win in california at stanford in terms of your confidence in your game ?
equaling your best appearance today , best result at a grand slam , do you try and embrace the vibe around the park in terms of the pressure placed on you in a semifinal ?
you 've had big slam runs before . you 've made quarters at all four slams . you have n't been top 10 yet , which is unusual . why do you think you 've had these big results but not the consistency ?
what are the good things and maybe the notsogood things about coming from slovakia ?
about your home country .
you were watching the match last night ?
did you find yourself pulling for stan because he was the underdog ?
did we interrupt you watching aga/vika ?
what are your preferences for the semifinal , which player ?
who do you think the tallest woman you have a win over has been , and who in mixed doubles , the tallest man , do you have a win over ?
there 's been four straight matches now with the men and women combined where the lowerranked player won . do you think when maria and serena go out there the underdogs get more confidence and it becomes contagious a little bit ?
martina navratilova talked about the age of power tennis , height is a real disadvantage . you 're overcoming tall players . how do you do it ?
how confident are you that you 'll be able to play as aggressive as you did today against agnieszka or vika ?
it looks like the way agnieszka played today makes you so angry .
when you won the second set , what was going through your mind at the start of the third ?
something particular she did better than she normally does ?
i think this is the fifth straight match where the higherranked player has lost . seems like there 's a weird vibe around the tournament .
how long will it take you to get over a loss like this ?
you said she played amazing . talk a little bit more about that .
your shirt , is that the attitude you want to show people after an upset like this one ?
it 's random ?
obviously you 're very disappointed . is there a feeling of an opportunity lost , because slams only come around four times a year ?
did she figure something out in your game or were you making life easier for her this time around ?
are you planning to play fed cup ?
what is your schedule from here to indian wells ?
just doha ?
you talk about your predictability as being a problem . how can you change that up in your game ?

of the women players on the tour , when she is playing like that , when she 's hot ...
up there with serena and some of the other big hitters ?

quite a comprehensive victory . do you think it 's good preparation heading into the semifinal ?
in terms of time spent on the court and your opponent . it was quite a onesided victory .
can you talk about how psychologically the second week of a slam , how it 's different from the first week .
looked like at match point you kind of smiled over to carlos .
carlos looked like he was very happy to see you do something on match point . what was that exchange about ?
you did n't do it on match point , though .
you said carlos was angry after the safarova match . what did you tell you to do differently ?
when you played the final in roland garros , we were told there were in front of the state tv in china 120 million chinese looking at you . do you know if now the number has increased ? are there more ?
we 're all a product of family . earlier this tournament , victoria spoke about her grandmother . maria spoke about her grandmother . can you talk about your grandparents a little bit .
does that hurt you in a way ? would you like her to come at some point ?
you said that you have eight different racquets . how do you tell them apart if they 're numbered one , two , three ...
were you surprised how dominant you were today ?
you were joking that flavia is a day older than you .
how do you know that ?
do you know how old everyone is ?
so you know every one ?
i think you missed the first backhand after 28 minutes . that never happens or is normal ?
are you planning to visit argentina with carlos in the future ?
to visit argentina .
what could you improve on today ? are there aspects of your game that you think you could improve on ?
you 've played so consistently here over the years . do you have certainly ritual routines that you follow in melbourne , like stay in the same place , eat in the same restaurants ? is there something you 're superstitious ?
did you eat italian food before playing pennetta ?
what was your reaction when you saw serena lose the other day ?
did you get a feeling that maybe your draw opened up a little bit because you might not have to play her in the semis ?
can you talk possibly playing ivanovic if she wins , what you would prepare for differently .
what happened out there ?
do you think you had a bit of a letdown after the serena match ?
do you have an injury ?
was there something specific in eugenie 's game ?
you 've been through what she 's going through now . what type of advice would you give her on how to deal with it ?
do you have any thoughts of playing fed cup ? you would have an opportunity for a rematch in a city that 's been great to you and not so great to you .
so probably not ?
obviously today is disappointing . how big has that tournament been for you in terms of where your career is at the moment ?
you 're getting close to the top 10. how much is getting back there a specific goal for you ?
do you feel something from her on the other side of the net , like she 's tough , she 's not afraid ? do you feel that when you 're playing her ?
in the first set you were , c'mon'ing after every point . were you trying to pump yourself up ?
did you get a chance to talk to novak at all after your win over serena ? if so , what did you say ?
what do you think the key was to the win today ?
was it more of a point of her aggressiveness dropping away or did you feel you got more aggressive ?
during the match you dropped your tossing ball twice . is that because of the wind ?
( question regarding justin bieber . )
you seemed very composed and calm out there . what were you feeling inside ? how do you feel now going to the semifinals ?
coming back after losing the first set , do you take confidence moving into the semifinals against someone like li na that you can come back ?
what is it like to be a tennis player in a country obsessed with ice hockey ?
i can imagine you never played ice hockey .
skate ?
have you ever met or do you know carling bassett ?
never any interactions , seen her , met her , nothing ?
ana said your game is really tough to read because your tennis does n't have any specific pattern . is that what you tried to do ?
during the injury timeout , how hard was it to stay focused ?
the genie army , are you going to take them everywhere with you ?
is there a pinchme part of this for you ?
was there any point in the match where you felt you had it in the bag ?
what are your thoughts on li na as your next opponent ?
what would you say in terms of matches against big players in the past prepared you best for a situation like today ?
do you know the genie army personally ?
are you going to have a meeting with them ?
how would you describe yourself outside and inside the court ?
you have five animals ?
do you have luggage space ?
it 's a packed press room . are you prepared with the kind of attention that comes with making your first semifinal ?
do you have your family here with you ?
getting messages from them daily ?
do you know li na is 12 years older than you ? do you think because she 's more experienced on the court , it 's going to be a big issue for you on thursday ?
have you ever exchanged words with her in the locker room ? do you feel there 's going to be some generation gap because she 's way older than you ?
your opponent was pretty aggressive today . did you find it difficult just to get into a rhythm just because of that aggressiveness on the other side of the net ?
a very long first set , 50 minutes . i guess a lot was about winning the big points .
how much of that was her and how much was you ?
score is not that different , but did it feel more competitive than the semi last year ?
were you able to generate enough momentum to get the crowd into it ? is that something that maybe could have helped ?
how long has it been since you 've gotten in a little pegging war in a professional match ?
pegging .
could you clarify what happened last night with the raising the arms that was on the television and written about today ? were you celebrating serena 's demise or what was that about ?
you head butted and kissed andrew after that ?
do you think it was invasive of them to be filming you , watching you in that area ?
it 's nearly 12 months since you played victoria . did you notice anything different in her game ?
does she become more dangerous the more she goes to the net ? does it make her more versatile ?
what do you think she exposed of your game today ? what did she work to do well against you today ?
was your movement , court movement as happy as because you 're known for that .
after last year 's match finished , does this match feel a little bit more on edge or heightened ?
you like these big occasions though , do n't you ?
yes to fed cup or you have n't decided yet ?
but it 's a possibility ?
february in cleveland does n't immediately jump out at you ?
you made fourth round here , but your ranking moved up a couple spots . does that change your outlook going forward ?
is it easier to focus on small tournaments ? next slam is four months away , so you have some time to work on the little ones .
what 's your schedule from now to the french , i guess ?
madrid , rome ?
what was your health issue there at the end of the second set ?
how much was that troubling you ?
when things were n't going your way in the second and third set , what were you telling yourself to get back into the contest ?
is it the same hip issue you had at wimbledon ? do you think it 's the same area ?
how do you rate her chances going forward ?
her chances .
when did the hip first start giving you trouble ?
given that it 's only your second tournament back , do you rate this as a success ?
will you quantify what the hip problem prevented you from doing the last two sets ? was it movement ?
is it a little extra disappointing in light of serena being out of the draw ? hopping this might be a real chance ?
how long does it take you to get over the disappointment ? like how long until you can start again or start looking forward to the next challenge ?
you too .
well , i admire yours . but in terms of disappointment , when you 're dealing with disappointment , how long does it take you to , like , i have lost today , how long does it take ?
coming off not playing many matches the end of last year and already getting a fair number at the beginning of this year , are you planning on a full schedule this 2014 , or are you thinking about phasing it out more maybe ?
because you played in such hot conditions earlier on in the tournament , do you think that might have taken a slight toll on your body ?
can you talk a little bit about the second set ? topsyturvy . she raced to 50. you climbed back . looked like the return game was maybe not your best return game of the match .
how big was that game for you ? how big was that return game for you ? was that something she did or something on your racquet ?
are you hard on yourself after losses like this ?
i notice that you went to the practice courts right away before your last match . in the past i have n't really seen you that eager to be back on the court . you seem very motivated and you want to work hard . is that something new for you , practicing more ? or practicing harder ? and right after a match ?
are you going to stick around melbourne as long as grigor is in ?
how did you rate her game ? another young player coming up on the tour . what did you see that was promising ?
is it weird having a match that the first four games lasted 37 minutes ?

do you think today was the best match of the four you played ?
with serena and sharapova out , does that change the mood at all ? did you watch them ?
had success earlier ; in the last few she 's gotten you . do you think something has changed in this matchup ?
what is the toughest thing about her as a player ?
after all the coffees you had , the postmatch adrenaline , are you going to be able to sleep ?
no boring book ?
what tv shows are you watching ?
do you know who shot her ?
did you and vika ever talk after the match in doha or did you just leave what happened in doha behind you ?
it was such a big tournament for you . what was the memory you will bring back to home ?
you had surgery last year . how do you feel yourself now physically ? you have no problem ?
what 's coming up next for you ?
can agnieszka win the title here this year ?
can you talk about your training situation .
seemed to have a bit of trouble with your forehand early today . any reasons for that ?
just wanted you to sum up your australian open . i know you 're very disappointed right at the moment , but how do you feel ?
would you have been happy with another fourth japanese in a row ? might have helped .
how satisfying was that win ? a milestone win for you .
you 're the last unseeded player in the fourth round . does that put a bit more pressure on you ?
she played very well in the second set . can you talk about how you turned it around in the third set .
you won a lot of matches last year and sis tournaments . does it feel like a different challenge winning matches at a grand slam ?
you 're going to be in the top 10 now .
it 's pretty much settled .
usually players get a new coach and go forward . you have n't got a coach at all at the moment . can you give us a reason why ?
have you ever played on the biggest court at a grand slam before ?
given all the matches you have won last year , do you feel you already belong in the top 10 , even though now is the time you 're getting into the top 10 ?
can you just talk about what were a couple key things , most important things , from july when you won your first tournament , to now , to make you a top10 player .
can you tell us a little bit what 's happening in romania behind you . do your wins make headlines in the newspaper , or tv , and radio talking about you ?
jelena ran out of challenges in the final game of the first set .
she tends to do that a lot . when you 're on court with her , do you think it 's weird how often she is wrong about challenges ?
it gives you confidence when she makes these terrible challenges ?
as your profile rises , people find out more about you , your breast reduction surgery was three or four years ago . does that play any part in your success ?
what about outside the tennis ?
you said you would do it again .
who do you talk to about strategy going into matches since you do n't have a coach ?
so you make all the decisions by yourself ?
so when you say 'your team ' here , is that your fitness trainer and physio ?
you sound very confident at the moment . where did you get that selfbelief and motivation ?
not a lot of older and brothers that you had to fight for your patch ?
do you remember spirlea reaching semifinals against venus ?
1997
when romanian player did you watch when you were young ?
what are your thoughts on cibulkova ?
you won six tournaments last year . do you think you 're ready to win this tournament ?
how does it feel ? good getting an upset like this over maria ?
your best result here . how does that make you feel ?
could you tell that she was not 100 % physically when you were playing ?
in the oncourt interview after the match , you spoke about how you had beaten her before in a big game . how important was that selfbelief coming in ?
were you bothered by her messing around with her toss ?
is that the sort of thing that may have distracted you in the past ?
when you say she was doing some things on purpose to affect you , would you call that gamesmanship ?
you know , like kind of underhanded tactics to win the match .
was there any wind out there to speak of that may have affected her ball toss , do you think ?
how big is the satisfaction then under these circumstances to have won this match against her ?
when you had your break , your short break at the end of the second set and you came back on court , were you surprised that she was going off court ? did that surprise you ?
how important was the last game in the second set ? you go up 50 ; she wins four games . maybe if you do n't win that game right there it changes the whole match , no ?
with maria and also now serena out , how big is the chance for you ? how excited are you by that ?
what does it say about you , now you 've reached quarterfinals of every grand slam which shows some consistency , no ?
you must have obviously have been happy with the win .
did the win feel as comfortable as the scoreline suggested it was ?
you both played last year under the same sort of pressure on center court . have you noticed much of a difference in her game ?
with the no.1 and 3 seeds out , does that change your mindset at all ?
she drove a ball back at you . did you feel she had a choice there ? was that the right shot to play , hitting the ball straight at you , hitting you in the hip ?
looked like she was trying to apologize to you .
what is the secret of starting a season well , starting the year well ?
how burnt were you at the end of last year ?
how much time did you take off and how much time in the offseason were you working for the new season ?
to be successful in a slam over two weeks , you have to be physically fit . nothing niggling at the moment that 's going to hamper you in the next five or six days ?
what you said on the court with rennae stubbs , can we say you are seriously considering having a marriage right now ?
you said it 's larger than caro 's .
can we say after serena and maria are gone , you and li na are the overwhelming favorites in the bottom and top half of the draw ?
right from the start , did n't look like you were quite yourself today . is everything okay ?
you have been struggling with your back in practice ?
that 's my job to know that .
what went bad today ? what happened ?
are you angry to lose ?
normally you hit a shot and you go forward . today you were hitting a shot and you were going back . do you have a problem on the back ?
seems every year in australia you have something .
ana drew a lot of support from the crowd . did you feel the crowd was against you at all throughout the match ?
were you taken by surprise by her performance and how much she 's improved perhaps in the last 12 months ?
what is the issue with your back specifically ?
how long has it been troubling you ?
patrick said that you blocked your back and then you blocked your neck .
no comment . and that you just could n't move and hit the way you usually do . can you just tell us what was really happening out there with your body ?
when you did retire from doubles , you were feeling worse or better than venus ? which one of you was more injured ?
patrick said before the hantuchova match you were feeling worse and you were even thinking about pulling out possibly . how did you cope with the pain over the last few days and how it 's gotten better or not better since that moment ?
you were almost on fire while the heat was on past couple weeks up in brisbane and down here . did the sudden change from really hot to really cold , maybe slower balls , stiffer muscles , do you feel the drastic change in weather affected you ?
what kind of treatment have you taken on the back the last few days ? also , just the offseason , you had a different kind of offseason this year . do you think that contributed in any way to what 's going on ?
it 's been three years now . last three years you 've had injuries : the two ankles and now the back . when you 're here , do you wait for the injury shoe to drop ?
when you have something like you have , being a tennis player and being existing all these rules against doping , are you afraid to take the pill that help you to get better sooner ? you have to check everything ? is that a worry that the player has ?
with serena williams the bar is set so high . greatest player in the universe . can she catch crissy and martina ? but in your own mind , when you fall short at a slam like here or wimbledon , what goes through your mind ? what is your disappointment .
some people have been talking about you winning all four slams this year .
is it disappointing that ca n't happen now ?
possibility of playing fed cup ?
you paid credit to ana today . do you think she can win here ?
do you see li na strong favorite versus pennetta ?
what are your plans now ?
i just wanted to ask how it feels to be in your first quarterfinal here ?
you mentioned on court that you feel , as you 're an older player now , you do n't feel as much pressure now as when you were younger . is that helping you play better ? why now ?
how nervous were you coming out of hopman cup ? after hopman cup when you hurt the wrist again , how did you deal with that just coming into here ?
strain ?
bristle ?
so just talk about today 's match . you played great in the first set . she played a little better in the second , although you seemed to be getting upset . then problems closing it out at 53 , but then mentally you got back in and won .
for you , in order to put your nerves aside and be able to play the way you want to at the end , what do you tell yourself ?
your next opponent , li na , same age , 31 .
almost the same day .
yeah , she 's one day younger .
older .
what 's your opinion ? there has been a lot of talk about why women are playing better in their 30s now . what 's your opinion about this ?
your win today , that should see you boost into the top 20 come the end of the tournament .
does that give you confidence going forward ?
you have a good track record against li na in the past , but you have n't actually ...
how do you feel she has improved in those last few years ?
when you started your comeback last february , it 's been almost a year now . did you think you would get to this point ?
because why ?
is it like a second career now ?
how does the us open semifinal prepare you for another match like this in the late stage of a grand slam ?
what are your thoughts on postgame interviews ? a few days ago , seppi was asked why he was n't losing his composure , as italians do . today you were asked what 's your favorite restaurant . then you been told you can go and have your carbonara . do you think there is stereotyping for italian tennis players ?
nothing wrong ?
you know , you had to continue being aggressive with angelique , but how hard it is like to go for your shots ? and at the same time , maybe did you feel afraid that you 're going to miss or you have to tell yourself , go for your shots , be aggressive ?
i suppose after your thirdround win where you saved a match point and you came back today , is there ever a feeling that you kind of have a second life or another chance after getting through such a close game and to move forward ?
you seemed very relaxed on the court . did you feel relaxed and calm today just to swing freely ?
will you forget also the way you played versus pennetta when you played her ? you remember the way you have to play against her ?
she thought to be one day younger than you .
you know that you played with her three times , and always in australia . it 's a coincidence .
yeah .
do you see her sometimes outside ? do you talk ? since you are same age , a long time together more or less , do you have the sort of friend relationship , or you just say good morning and good evening to pennetta ?
so do you have any story to tell between and you pennetta , something you exchange words or say something funny or , i do n't know , jokes or anything that comes up to your mind ?
are you conscious of what 's going on on rod laver arena at the moment with serena ? have you been watching ?
i think it 's 52 in the third set .
no comment ? you 're not concentrating on that ?
surely one of the best wins of your career .
what was the difference between this match and the previous meetings ?
that the difference for you now , you avoid getting sort of brittle in that crucial moment ?
how did you do that ? how did you not think about who you were playing ? what did you tell yourself ?
how aware were you of her back injury she 's been suffering ?
you served both your last two service games out to love . in the circumstances , how pleased are you with that kind of finish of such an important match against a player like serena ?
you said after you won your third round beating venus in auckland gave you confidence for serena . obviously they are different places right now . you have n't had that much success against the williamses . do you think that one win made you think this one is possible ?
how does this win taste for you ? is it just fish and chips or lobster with champagne ? i know it 's a happy meal , but i 'm not thinking about mcdonald 's .
almost exclusively serena does n't lose grand slam matches when she wins the first set . can you talk us through your mindset sitting at your chair a set down ? mentally , how did you turn it around ?
so you 're full of confidence now . can you go all the way ? can you win the australian open ?
in the third set you hit her backhand a lot . is it something you identified in the preparation for the match ?
was this a more a triumph of kind of your mental strength being able to close out the match the way you did , or execution ? you littered up the stat sheet with winners and you did n't face a break point after the first set .
it 's been many , many years struggle for you , ups , downs . now is ana ivanovic ready to win the australian open ?
you have already played one hometown hero in sam . you could play another one , casey dellacqua , if she wins tonight . how do you feel about that ?
is there a sense that when serena is out of a grand slam it 's a very different grand slam ? because so much is concentrated on her as the dominant player that when she 's out , it just makes the whole event seem somewhat different ?
are you keeping up the same superstition , having the same food every morning ?
you 're now unbeaten since the start of the season . did you do anything different in the off season , preparations , physical , mental ?
extraordinary support today , as we could hear . does it make it any more special ? any connections to the city ?
a match is never over until the final point , but did you have any sense out there what was the time when you had a sense that , hey , i could finally beat serena ? was there a moment or time when you sensed that ?
when you netted that forehand to lose the first set , you gave a sign to your team , but it was an unbelievably calm sign . what was the message you were communicating ? you felt you were still in the game ?
last time you made the final here you were wearing a blue dress . looks a lot like this one . are you superstitious ?
what 's been the low point since '08 and after when you were so high in the world and just to struggle ? was there a moment you remember as being sort of the darkest ?
sometimes is it difficult when you win a slam when you 're very young , because you are n't able to manage all the things that come with it ?
in the first set i think your backhand was more unstable than usual . how did you get through it ?
first quarterfinal at 19. how are you feeling ? nervous , excited , mixture ?
do you give yourself more of a chance of beating ana ivanovic than if it was serena ?
did you feel the support from the genie army tonight ?
how many stuffed animals did you get so far ?
you did n't seem to get very nervous . when was the last time you were getting super nervous in a match ?
casey said in the second and third sets the conditions changed a little bit , which she thought helped your game . did you notice any conditions change ?
it seemed like you could have pulled away sooner . did you feel like maybe you could have done that in the first set ? maybe why did n't it happen ?
you lost in quallies here last year . now you 're three matches from winning the title . does this feel ahead of schedule ?
you spoke the other day about how tough it is to win a grand slam as a teenager these days . but the draw opens up a little bit now , does n't it ?
the level between juniors , like when you won wimbledon , to now , did n't you find there was a fairly significant jump ? does n't it surprise you a bit that in a year and a half you 're in the quarters of a slam ?
why do you think you 've been able to transition better than a lot of other junior slam champs ?
tactically from watching you in juniors until now , it seems your game has changed the last year or so . you 're aggressive , hitting a bigger ball , bigger serve . did you make those changes specifically because you needed to be a little bit more aggressive on the senior tour ?
what do you remember about the match with ana at wimbledon ? what do you think worked in your favor ?
how is rod laver compared to centre court in wimbledon and philippe chatrier ?
how did you keep focused and calm throughout the day ?
you slept in till noon . how many hours of sleep did you get ?
what do you do to keep your mind off tennis during a grand slam ?

could you tell us the story of your youtube of laura and genie gangnam style ?

do you sense she 's at the young , starting phase where she 's fearless and maybe not worried too much and hitting her shots ?
do you think agnieszka radwanska has a game to beat muguruza ?
started out , had an early break . you toughed it out . getting yourself in sticky situations but finding your way out of them ?
what were you most pleased with in your play today ?
i think it 's the fifth slam in a row you made it to second week . why ? what 's the key for you ?
is there more motivation at the big tournaments ? seems like you focus better at the big tournaments .
what 's it like playing a player younger than you who is hungry and views you as a statement win .
do you enjoy the pressure that comes with when you 're expected to win as opposed to being the player that no one knows ?
andy murray was saying before the tournament pairing up with a legendary coach is a lot like dating a girl or something , like basically he 's trying to impress that person for the first three months . do you feel that way at all , like in terms of the pressure or anything with paul or feeling like you need to impress him with the way you play or fight or practice or anything like that ?
what are those things that you told him you felt on the court ?
as you probably know by now , you might face azarenka in the next round . can you just talk about your memories from that match last year ? it was controversial not from your end , but talk about your memories of that match .
what do you have to do against her ?
do you feel like you 're mentally stronger now a year later ?
do you think too much was made of all the medical timeout controversy and all that stuff from the match last year , or ...

so your offcourt relationship with her is like what ?
so you got through these first three rounds here when you are expected to win , and so you 're going into a match where you 'll be the underdog . do you need go in that thinking , i can swing freer , i can take more chances ? is that a good place to be ?
at tournaments , especially at the slams , do you go on media lockdown ? do you not read anything that 's being written , ignore the papers and ignore twitter ?
ban ?
leash ?
what did dirk nowitski write you ?
can we assume that you were fairly spent after the last match . was it kind of a little bit tough to get through today ?
did you change your normal preparation routine after what happened on thursday to today , or was it just business as usual in the way you prepared ?
each time you were challenged in the second set you were up a break on her back . you must draw a lot of strength on that on a day when your serve was n't necessarily firing ?
you went to practice after the match ?
so basically you wanted to hit more balls ? are you feeling just a little bit lack of match play ?

happen during practice or a match ?
when you were in pain , during the match did you ever think about retiring , or you just hoped like to push through ?

did you think about that going in ?
did you talk to anybody else or just your father ?
they 're tired ?
i know you 're saying it 's still very early and you 're realizing that you 've won this , but what can something like this really mean to you with the length of career that you 've had , and last year where you came so close to retiring ?
how hard is that , i guess , psychologically ? because the way tennis works , you play a lot of weeks in the year , and almost every week you have to end almost by losing .
winning a million dollars , are you paying for the dinner ?
even before the injury you broke into the top 10. is this still a goal then or a dream then ? did you think you could win a premier mandatory tournament ?

getting the trophy at this moment , does it feel to get more throughout the season according to how you feel right now , or is it just ...

( question regarding jose perlas . )
it was pretty topsyturvy match and close conditions there at the end . talk about , you know , the match .
in the end she was struggling with in the wind for a while and you were struggling with it for a while and then towards the end you guys were keeping the ball in play . did you feel she 's managed it a bit better in the end ?
you were up six straight games straight games and she was about to serve for it and she called her coach . did that give you any confidence that she might be a little nervous or something ?
how was it on court with you and paul ? you were more like conversational . you both say things . sometimes the coaches try to talk at the person . it 's very one sided ?
you say the wind was n't the deciding factor in the match , so in your mind what was the deciding factor ?
is it hard mentally when you have conditions that bad to kind of not think that it 's not going to be a crap shoot , it 's a flip of the coin at that point ?
what were you happy about in your game the whole tournament ?
target ?
did you get to run around with the gun or you did it online ?

you do n't strike me as very outdoorsy .
flavia described the last set as a disaster for both of us . how would you characterize it ?
did you need this result , quarterfinal at a big tournament playing , you know , some quality tennis through the first few rounds ? do you think that when you were coming into this tournament you kind of needed something positive like this ?
do you need to stay patient or do you ever get impatient with yourself ?
you plan on playing for that long ?
so when the windstorm came in , you said it was totally out of the blue , unexpected . you and paul , will you sit down and talk about how you played through that third set with the wind ? like , say , it happens again . do you sort of get teachable moments out of playing in that ?
guess what ? it 's windy in florida .
overall satisfied with the week ?
i think last year you were saying you found it more comfortable to play in europe and not in the states because of the attention ; you can fly under the radar . are you finding it easier this time around ?
is it worth it so far ?
this is obviously one of the bigger american tournaments , and you 're one of the more recognizable americans in the tournament , especially for the women . do you ever feel you have to represent the american women in this tournament , especially considering it 's been a while since we have had an american woman win this tournament ?
was that a fun match to play ?
how did you respond in that third set ? because you obviously lost the second set ; got broken serving for it . did you just accept the wind and play ? tactically what did you do ?
what 's going through your mind ? how do you handle when it 's those crazy conditions ?
yeah .
do you think maybe you having a little more experienced helped you with the nerves ?
what do you think sloane still needs to improve to make the next step ?
when you have situations like today with that match , what is the tougher aspect ? the physical part of playing the game or the mental part ?
what were you thinking when you lost those six games in a row in the second , beginning of the third ?
but how did you start to get yourself back into it ?
how do you describe your emotions now ? you almost seemed embarrassed by this match , but you won .
you lost six straight games after you called your coach on court before ...
you were about to serve for the match . why call the coach then ?
do you remember another match like these conditions , some other time in your career , this match ?
li na , second time you will play her this year . talk a little bit about her game . what is it that she does that causes you problems ?
players say about sloane , they say she 's the fastest player .
obviously a pretty good match ; very tight till the end . how are your feelings on it ?
you were much closer than australia .
a silver lining ?
you did a good job of continuing success from australia . a lot of players have one big result and then fall off . obviously acapulco was great . now here , making quarters . how have you been able to sustain that , do you think ?
miami is a big tournament for you .
how has your life changed since australia ? i have n't seen you since then .
what do you mean , too much people ?
what 's the coolest thing you got to do since australia ?
you got the big hat , right ?
how do you pack that ?
california , you have been carrying it ?
you have a tradition . every summer you come to california , you win a tennis tournament , and you have a crazy celebration . i know you 're entered in the bank of the west tournament . if you win , what will you do there , do you think ?
so did you tell your father , you know , you might get arrested next time ?
so you get your emotions from him ?
let 's talk about your doggies .
what did you tell your doggies in terms of the pressure of being a tennis dog ?
do the dogs socialize with other dogs ? a lot of players now have dogs on women 's tour . do the dogs hang out together ?
what do you think you sort of learned from this experience of getting to this big spotlight of the grand slam final ? you 're getting really close to top 10 now . the attention i think will probably just sort of keep growing . what have you learned from this experience so far ?
offcourt attention , would you handle that in the future differently or not ?
on tv they were comparing your serve and radwanska 's , which is not that powerful , but you have a pretty good serve . are you proud of it ? how do you get such power of it ?
but aside from today , why have you been able to kick it up ?
lots of men have been talking about stan winning the australian open , thinking , if he can do it , i can do it . do you think there is a feeling out there with the women as well that a change is coming , people are thinking , why not me ?
are you getting bored with these victory press conferences ?
so talk about the match a little bit . you said yesterday that your legs were feeling heavy at this tournament . it must have been nice to get on and off the court quickly .
why do you think you had less pressure today ?
the other day you said you were n't sure if you could win the tournament , but certainly the players that you are going to play next you have beaten this year already . it 's certainly a possibility you could make the final , right ?
how is it working with wim ?
last year you won , incredibly , six tournaments , three different surfaces , but you 're still not very well known to the public . is there anything you can tell us about yourself as a person , how you like to approach life , what you like to do off court ?
so jelena said she 's really into shoes . she has a tremendous shoe collection . what do you like to go for shopping ?
and speaking of money , one of the most famous stories in tennis is about how serena and venus ' father richard were watching the match i think with your manager , virginia when she won ...
so if virginia did n't win that tournament , maybe women 's tennis would be completely different , yes ?
you received a wildcard at madrid last year from tiriac , and then after that the year really took off for you . can you talk about that , and was it important ?
why did you and virginia decide that you needed like a new , outside coach or a new coach when you contacted wim ?
a tough question : who creates a better tournament and is better for tennis : the romanian banker , tiriac , with his madrid tournament , or larry ellison the computer billionaire here ? what 's a better tournament ?
yes . and who has more of an impact , tiriac or ellison ?
how much contact do you have with ion , and do you go to him for advice , as well ? does he provide you with information and advice and suggestions ?
do you have any contact with ilie nastase ?
one of the fun things about tennis is that each country seems to have its own culture , and that 's expressed in the type of tennis that they play . so we spoke to ivanovic a few days ago . she said serbs were temperamental and combustible and sometimes angry . what 's the romanian culture within tennis ?
personality .
yeah , all the romanians who play tennis , what 's kind of the personality that you put out on court , do you think ?
so when you get recognized back in romania , what sort of places ? is it just walking down the street ?
going to a restaurant ?
do they want pictures , autographs ?
we talked to radwanska before the tournament . she said about your match in doha that she thought that she played well and there was n't anything that she could do to get you off that day . talk with that match and how well were you playing that day ?
will you win a grand slam tournament ? if so , which one would you like to win first ?
first off , just thoughts on the match . another tough one ? kleybanova played you tight and was able to play through .
you 're the first american woman to make the quarterfinals since 2008 .
what did you like or did n't like about stadium 2 ?
can you hear ?
so there is ambient noise ?
pennetta next round . i think she leads the head to head 21 .
as you progress through a tournament and get deeper does the pressure increase ? do you actually feel like , you know , it 's a little bit more tense as each match goes on ?
obviously you have been playing very well at these big events . this is a pretty big event . you 're doing well here . us open , australian open .
wimbledon fourth round . no , but you have been peaking at the right times . is that something you have learned how to do with experience ?
physically do you think you 're back to where you were before the injury ?
painfree ?
do you think maybe wimbledon , us open , australian open , now here , that the tournaments where you get a day off in between maybe that helps you for recovery ?
what goals do you still have left for yourself ?
what do you make of camila , her game on court and then her off court as well ? somebody who seems very independent , i guess , for the italian establishment .
how about on court , her game ?
if you were going to be coaching her , what would you have her work on next ?
how has the energy of italian tennis kind of changed from when you were younger to now ? because with fabio on the men 's side and your backup , as well ...
you 're good friends with fabio off court .
do you think he 's misunderstood , or is his craziness accurate ?
shy , introverted .
he 's introverted . really ?
you would n't think that .
you have been around for a long time , 11 years plus inside the top 100. what do you think has been the biggest key to find that consistency and being good for so long ?
also the amount of time you have to put in taking care of your body , to keep that level , that 's a long time .
how do you find that motivation to keep coming back ?
comes back ?
how close were you to stopping , do you think ?
like close , about to pick up the phone and say , i 'm done , or ...
like top 100 ?
taylor townsend , wonder what you thought of her game ?
taylor townsend .
some people in the us tennis federation have criticized her fitness .
obviously a great win , especially given the track record you had recently against her . a bit of an unusual match : there were ten straight games you won there . what were seeing out there that you were doing well and maybe she was n't ?
how did your hurt your back ?
is it muscular or skeletal ?
how do you feel right now ?
when you were younger , if you compare your game with your early 20s , do you think you 're more aggressive now ?
with the early departure of azarenka and sharapova , you 're now clearly one of the top favorites . does this play against you or in your favor ?
did your back get so bad you thought you might not be able to play today ?
so it felt very good when you woke up this morning ?
do you follow the tournament when you 're not playing ? did you watch sharapova yesterday ?
going back to the aggression issue , at what point to you realize that you wanted to become a more aggressive player ? how much of it is convincing yourself to be an aggressive player ?
not picking on you here , but when is the last time you were at a tournament and you felt 100 % healthy and no injuries ?
how did she compare to the way you expected her to play the match ?
where is your confidence level right now ?
you said you 're you not feeling 100 % physically . where are you kind of aching right now ?
she complimented your defensive game . have you really worked on that , and can you talk about that ?
when you say that she is a great player , what is it about her game that you find dangerous ?
you said you were nervous in the second set . why were you nervous ?
does that give you confidence , that the last two matches you 've been able to not play the best tennis that you 've ever played and win , or are you worried ?
what was your small injury ?
which leg ?
you said this match was very important for you . why ? the size of tournament ? is it that the opponent was younger ? up and coming ? what was will particular reason for the importance ?
what did you do before the match ? before it started you left of the court for a minute .
what about at the end of the second set ? what did you do ?
just to change your mind ?
do you feel physically well enough to win this tournament ?
you have dellacqua in the quarterfinals . that 's not the usual opponent you would expect at this stage , so what are your thoughts on that ?
do you think it 's an advantage or disadvantage that she had a walkover this round ?
would you like to have back that forehand in the last game , 3015 ?
looked like you started very slow . is it something that you did n't warm up enough or something ?
what is the animal ?
what 's the takeaway from this experience , from being here and doing so much better than you have last year ?
you were really serving well , especially the early part of the third set . it was like raonic for a while there . if you could have got a couple serves at 30all at 43 maybe it could 've been over .
what was she like compared to you expected her to be like ?
what happens now ?
do you think that was a classic power against retrieving ? you 're more aggressive than she is but she is pretty consistent .
after the disappoint of the three tournaments coming in here , this must be a little bit of a boost .
this is an obvious one . you saw lauren davis pulled out and dellacqua is the next player into the quarterfinals if you could 've got through to the semifinals .
you would have played dellacqua to get to the semifinal .
so you had no idea who you would play after this match ?
so you never look at the draw or just this tournament ?
hard to find rhythm in that match . a lot of breaks . was it an instance of you just did n't have it there ? was it something she was doing to cause you problems ?
what do you think the cause of that was ? bad day or something bothering you otherwise , i guess .
what was the discussion near the end there with the umpire ? what was that about ?
what did she say to you , the umpire ?
in melbourne you said that officials did n't really know what was going on in terms of the heat . do you think there should be a kind of rule if there is not one already about a friend 's box calling lines , calling ...
but do you think the player , him or herself , should have any kind of accountability if a friend 's box member does something like that ?
a few months in , how can you assess your partnership with sven so far ?
you 're now somewhere in midcareer . what do you use to motivate yourself goalwise ? do you target a specific tournament like i think you targeted roland garros , or do you have something else ?
what do you make of camila as a player ? she 's bursting out quickly here . you said it 's very up and down at times . how do you assess her and her whole presence out there ?
you have seen players come off of long injury breaks , and it takes them time to almost catch up with the fitness and the match play . where do you think you are physically right now in terms of being 100 % ?
are you talking physical presence and rhythm or talking about fatigue ?
is it easy to be patient when it 's not coming automatically ?
in your gut , do you think you can win another slam or two ?
what 's the next week like for you ? hang around here ? a lot of players stick around here ; nice place to be . or do you go straight to florida ?
happy with the progress through two matches ?
so you do feel different being the top seed ?
what is different ? the pressure or the attention or internal to you ?
you had the first match each of the first two days . do you like playing that early in the morning ?
your first two service games , four double faults today .
then you got it straightened out . did you change anything , or too early in the morning to serve ?
you talk a lot in your book about wuhan , being a woman from wuhan . can you talk and explain for some of us maybe who do n't know what makes you being from wuhan special , different from somebody from beijing ?
how about different . the personality .
are people from wuhan different , more outspoken or independent or something like that ?
after your win in australia and being ranked first here , do you have to deal with that whole thing , why does n't she win every week ? she already won australia . are you able to make sure there is not too much pressure on you being from the world 's biggest country ?
when you go home to wuhan and you 're with your friends and family and you go out , how difficult is it for you now to be able to just wander around the city ?
you said in australia you made him famous .
how did that feel ?
it was a difficult match , lots of breaks of serve from both of you . so how did you kind of settle yourself at the end ?
can you compare your nerves here in that match to the us open when you played wozniacki ? was it similar ?
probably the best win of your career , with wozniacki . i 'd like to ask you an honest question : one of our best journalists , jon wertheim wrote that long piece about all the different investors that you owe : mendy wiggins , eran gaudot , alex ramirez , dominic owen , todd andrews . you 'll win $ 52,000 here . do you think it would be appropriate to pay some of these people back ?
but you 're a grownup . you 're a 22 year old woman . everyone or many people know about this . do n't you think this would be appropriate to take accountability and deal with this ?
that 's part of the game .
wait a second . let her put it in her own words . you do n't have to coach her . she 's a 22 year old .
if you want to answer in spanish or something ...
you obviously have made it to the second week of a grand slam a few times . you 're a player who a lot of people know , and i think some people are still surprised that you have to be a qualifier this tournament because we have seen you have so many good wins . what do you think it will take for your ranking to catch up for you to start being seeded at these tournaments and not a qualifier ?
you just said consistency has been a problem . you missed that overhead , but you were in such a good position . what was going through your mind towards the end when you were trying to close out the match with maria ?
your style is a little bit different from other italian players . other italian players like to hit with spin . you hit the ball very flat and fast . how did you pick up such that kind of play style ?
what did you learn from agassi ?
this is obviously your first time in the tournament . you have done really well . the way you play , is it conducive to these conditions ? are the conditions good for you ?
so what 's happening with italian tennis these days ? fabio is doing well ; you 're going to face pennetta next . why do you think italian tennis is doing so well ?
very nice fight out there to get through a difficult match . what was your general take away from it ?
we saw michael mortensen is here with you , but i guess your dad is still doing the oncourt coaching . can you talk about that setup ? is he considered your coach now or consultant ?
was that like a language thing ? i know ana ivanovic has a serbian coach , and she said that she likes being coached in serbian . i think bernard tomic has the same thing with a croatian coach now . is there any sort of like player like you grew up playing tennis in polish ?
key phrases he uses ? obviously we do n't understand . he gets pretty animated sometimes .
i think you played her last year and lost in straights . how much do you look at that match the night before and talk over what you 're going to utilize on court ?
are you doing that on youtube , like googling clips , or ...
a few players have been weighing in on how good their prep or bad their preparation was before coming into this event . just checking in with you , how happy were you with , yeah , your practice or preparation coming into here ?
i think i saw you the other day running to the site . your dad was waiting for you with your bag . that 's something you probably ca n't do very often on tour .
is that like a little bit of head clearing time for you , too ?
you guys stay at a house ?
aside from the four slams , do you think this is the best tournament in the world ? and do you think it should become the fifth slam ?
when does rory get here ?
with the ring in hand ?
when you look back on your career , is there one shot that stands out that you 're most proud of ?
one shot .
do you ever dream about tennis ?
when you are up close and personal with golf or walking the courses , they are great sportsmen , but how do you compare the two ? ball is just sitting there , no opponent , it 's sort of ...
have you gotten madder on the tennis court or the golf course ?
you got two today .
you 're doing pretty well .
what is the other one ?
seems like you did exactly what you said you wanted to do , which is to move in and finish the points . is that how you felt out there ?
beating a top10 player , is it something you expect yourself to do now ? seems like a pretty comfortable , almost routine sort of match for you in a lot of ways ?
what do you know about halep ? she 's like you , been rising really fast .
saviano , nick saviano has a long history in the game as a player , american coach , working with many different players . could you take a moment and say what 's special about the guy , what the dynamic is between the two of you .
can you compare your form now to australia ?
serve placement , general control , what is it ?
what did you learn from your justin bieber moment or was there a fallout ?
i have another offcourt question . with all the talk in australia about genie 's army , some said , wait a second , genies ca n't have armies . what 's your position on that ? do you think genies do have armies or not really ?
it 's a trick question .
you need to get some red sharpies for those kids who were there for your first match because they got the g and e , second e , then after that , it was nothing ?
middle guy was an n but they had run out of marker by then .
the question i have , what 's the difference between when nick 's around and when he 's not ? obviously you have had great results when he 's been there . do you have a sales pitch planned to try to get him with you more this year ?
for your offcourt commitment , you have had a couple of media tours you had to do . how much preparation do you have to do for that compared to what you 'd be doing on the court ? do you treat it with the same professional sort of mentality ?
so the justin bieber thing went over my head . in terms of canada , second to get to the australian semis and first win at wimbledon juniors . do you feel like you 're carrying the flag in some way ? there is some certain rally cap thing you got going with canada , feeling the pride of being one of the first or if not `` the '' first ?
a lot happens to a player when they first go deep in a tournament . singapore , what 's the most interesting or fun thing you have experience you have had since australia ?
and activity off tour ?
you mentioned going to singapore . do you think qualifying there this year is a realistic goal ?
what was it like to walk out there as the top seed and open up your tournament ?
were you happy with how you played ?
there are not that many chinese players on the tour . is it still special to play another chinese player , or is it something you 're used to ?
do you think there will be a lot more in the future ? people have talked about how you have inspired a lot of girls and boys to play , start playing tennis . do you think like in 10 , 20 years there could be 20 chinese players top 100 or something ?
you played out there today in front of thousands of fans . you speak to reporters all the time and do endorsements . but in your book you said tennis is a very lonely sport . could you talk about that ? how is tennis lonely , a lonely sport for you ?
we see a lot of the top players playing doubles at a tournament like this . why not you ?
do you not like doubles ?
it would help your serve and volley , though .
how much time do you spend looking at the draw ? is it just one match at a time , or do you look ahead at all ?
tonight is daylight savings time ; watches and clocks go forward one hour . will you go to bed early ?
when you have n't played for a couple of weeks and you come to a tournament , as you said , you can be a little bit nervous because you do n't know how you 're going to play . so what does carlos say to you going into a firstround match like this when you have n't played for a couple of weeks ?
you have had a very long career . some ups , some downs .
much advice from many people . maybe what is the best piece of advice that you have gotten in your career ?
not to retire .
how do you see it differently now ?
you have hit a lot of different shots over the course of your career forehands , backhands , serves , volleys what 's the most memorable shot you 've ever hit ?
no , that you have hit . the one that you always remember .
but do you remember one specific shot , maybe match point at , you know , the french open or australian open or some crazy circus shot that you hit ?
do you have a happier shot that you can remember ?
yeah , that was a very sad shot .
now , what 's the best part of the desert here , this part of the world ?
two years ago , the two years that you went away from tennis and you were doing the studies and things like that , how much did you play at that time ? and then when you decided to come back , how much in advance did you start working ?
when you were in university , did you study journalism ?
if you were a journalist and your editor said , write a story about the career of na li , what would you say ?
from when you started .
you were much closer to her than you have been before . you looked very frustrated by the end .
when you take on that level , that standard , what do you learn from where your level is at the moment compared to , say , six months ago ? what do you take from this to move on ?
it 's been a great start of the season for you . you look confident .
obviously nice to be given a wildcard .
playing on your home patch , as well , is n't it ?
that 's nothing in america .
did you have anything to do with laura linking up with mauricio ?
did you talk to her or ...
so you think they make a good match ?
obviously terrible news this morning about bally . i 'm sure that you 'll want to say something about that .
she 's someone that you have obviously known very well , played fed cup well , been around the tour .
she 's a real fighting spirit , which is going to help enormously , is n't it ?
first match here . how did you find the conditions ? how did you like your game today ?
how did you feel about your opponent 's game ?
the ball can move very quickly through the court here . have you found that to be the case ? and also , do you have to adjust your game to , you know , fall back a little bit more , or do you try to stay still on the baseline and adjust your timing ?
kurumi said she looked up to you as a role model in terms of play style and games , because you are not that tall , as well . she said your play style is similar to her .
what kind of treatment did you have on your feet to make it better ?
it feels perfect now ?
you 've obviously won a lot of matches this year , more than the past years . does winning still feel special , or is it something normal at this point ?
do your results affect your mood like outside of tournaments ? do you feel happier now that you 're winning a lot more ?
what do you do to keep your mind off tennis outside of tennis ?
do you like to watch tennis on tv ?
not at all ?
i talked to a number of other players and commentators and they speak very highly about your game . they like the way that you play , balanced , tactically , and things . why do you think that is ? what is it about your game do you think makes it special ?
have any of the romanian women players from the past had any influence on you ?
do you see her every day ? is she here ?
what was the upshot of finishing with australia and the hype around what you achieved over there ? how long did it take you to come down from cloud 9 ?
the point really is the confidence something like that would give you as you look ahead to this year .
how hard was it , the turnaround from fed cup and having to fly all the way to the middle east ? it was a tough swing for you .
three service return winners in the first game . must make you feel good in terms of getting into the match .
what 's your fastest serve ever ?
has anything surprised you since the australian open ? like something you read or ...
on that point , what have you done with the menagerie of australian stuff ?
what are the conditions like in terms of your game ?
yeah . especially going into playing errani now .
were you able to follow the tiebreak with federer and wawrinka ?
how long does it take you , particularly when you arrive at a tournament , for you to adjust to court conditions , balls , things like that ?
errani is such a good retriever . what kind of a challenge is that for you ?
congratulations .
could you tell me what was the difference in the thought process today compared to your round robin loss to simona , or did everything just click today ?
how quickly did you know today it was going to be a different day ? did you know before the match ?
to go back to friday when you were n't playing but simona was , she technically had a chance to knock you out of the tournament then if she lost that second set to ana . was that going your mind at all , that she might think it was a good idea to get rid of the tournament 's top seed there ?
first set was a lot closer than the scoreline might indicate . talk about how you were able to turn it around and reel it off .
throughout the year and also throughout this tournament , there were ups and downs . how much pride do you find in yourself that you managed to back up every one of those downs with an up like the win today ?
along those lines , you 've obviously won three straight years here . last two years you 've barely lost matches . how much more gratifying is it even though a lot of players would love to have your year , how important was it to end your year on this note ?
you keep saying throughout the year that it was n't your best year , had n't been going well for you . do you think now that it 's all said and done you 're the best player this year ?
before next year there will be an offseason .
what are you looking forward to the most ?
yesterday when you rallied from 14 and made it to 64 in the tiebreak against caroline . that 's why you do n't give up . i saw this little girl and huge smile on her face . how does it feel after years later ? you won this title for the time in 2001 , and years later here you are and you 're still inspiring so many little girls from around the world .
how happy are you that you got the chance to sort of correct that loss to simona later the same week and did n't have that taste in your mouth for the offseason ?
we know you 're a karaoke queen . have you managed to get out and go visit any of the karaoke places in singapore ?
simona said she was tired tonight . how much of that was apparent on the court ?
you say you 're going back home , but will you be staying in singapore for a few more days ?
two things : how much was it in your mind today about getting the bagel in the second set ? and what were your goals next year ?
for winning you get this trophy , $ 2 million , and an orchid named after you . which is the most important ?
is it just called the serena orchid or do you get to choose ?
serena , you are a stunner off and on the court . what goes into selecting the perfect championship outfit ?
just want to check , you know , goals for next year .
since you mentioned you 're coming back to play the iptl , i believe .
are you just playing the singapore leg or are you planning on going to other cities ?
do you know if dubai is on the radar or not ?
you have achieved a lot of great things in your career . have you reached a point in your life where you think , you know i 'm going to do it my way ? it 's my way or the highway ?
it was a great start to the match for you , and then suddenly seemed to change midway throughout the first set . she won the last eight games . what do you think changed the momentum ?
how would you describe the change in her game over the two matches ?
how much of today was just the difference of playing in a final ? how much does that make the match feel different ?
how much did the win before factor in knowing she was going to come back and go twice as hard this time ?
was it on your mind at all ?
knowing that she would maybe play better this time .
like you said on the court , you still had a great week and it 's tough to be sad . can you talk about your emotions right now ? how do you feel ?
do you think that she was on a mission today other than winning the title ? do you feel a little bit of regret not to throw the match against ivanovic so you did n't have to come to this match ?
what would you say was the biggest difference between the first match against serena and tonight 's match ?
what do you think you need to do to take that next step ? what are you going to work on between now and next year particularly ?
why do you think you were feeling tired ? just the last match of the year ? all of it ? just this week , or something else ?
offseason now . do you have any plans aside from partying ?
still party ?
a few days ago billie jean king said that the first time she watched you play that she had the feeling she was watching a champion ?
you got up to no.2 this year ; grand slam final . what are your hopes for next year ?
obviously a very tough one . is there anything that you can explain that made the difference , or just a coin flip at the end with how tight you two were ?
tough luck today . serena said that you played her very differently today . were your tactics different ? can you talk about what your game plan was before ?
we know you 're an incredibly competitive person . where does this rank in terms of losses for you and how you feel right now ?
with how well you played in the round robin you were the only player going undefeated in either group and coming so close to beating no.1 , is this may e the best tournament you ever played , or close to it , even though you did n't make the final ?
when you saved the first match point there was this really great rally and you finished it at the net . is that the kind of point that you 're going to keep replaying later in your mind and feel really proud of ?
speaking of which , just kind of curious , with how well you 've been playing the last five months , are you almost bummed the season is over and that there is n't a slam next week ? or are you like , no , i 'm good ; season is over , i need a holiday ?
with the disappointment of losing this match still fresh , on a positive note , it 's been lovely to have you in singapore . you got legions of fans here and they have a massive response every time you play your matches . been some of the highlights of the tournament . just wondering what 's been your personal highlight ?
how long do you give yourself off before diving into marathon mode ?
is it unusual spending as probably unique as this experience has been the night before a match with an opponent at the mariah carey concert ? guessing you had n't done that before . what was that like to sort of be with someone for that long before you know you 're playing each other ?
looking to the offseason , how busy is your offseason ? are you going to actually get some time to hang up the racquet and just sit on the coach with your dog , or are you actually going to have sponsor obligations and things like that ?
caroline , i believe you 're on team dubai in iptl . are you planning on playing the matches in dubai or you 're not really sure ?
how would you sum up your year so far since this is the last competitive tournament for you sort of ?
sure .
obviously you 've gotten to no.1 ; you were there for quite a long time . in two years i guess the one goal remaining is the slam for you . i know you 've talked about that . do you feel like how well you played this last of the year and this week that you 're closer than ever to knowing what it takes to make that last breakthrough ?
congratulations .
down 14 in the tiebreak , what was going through your mind and how did you turn things around ?
a bit of a slow start before you were able to turn the match around . was it just a matter of being flat ? lack of rhythm the first set ? and then how did you turn it around in the second ?
tell us about the racquet smack . it was quite epic .
this is the third time this year you 've dropped a first set again caroline and come back to win . after that first set , did you remind yourself of those occasions ?
after the match with simona you said you were really looking forward to playing her again . in case she is the one you 're facing in the final , how excited are you to get that opportunity so fast ?
you went to the mariah carey concert last night with caroline . what was it like to be with her last night and put the friendship aside and go out and play today ?
when she served the match point and then held for 6all , there was an epic point that she won . is that one of the points you 're going to remember for quite a while ?
yeah .
you mentioned she was doing something different on court against you . can you tell us what surprised you ? as you said , you started is it solve it . how did you solve it ?
she pretty much has gotten more aggressive overall though , do n't you think ?
this is the first time wta finals held in singapore . stacey gave it a 10 out of 10 this morning . just like to get your thoughts on how we 're doing .
you were down 14 in the tiebreak . did you feel a little lucky then ? you hit the net twice .
must be a terrific feeling winning a match like that , but could you help feeling a little sorry for caroline ?
you were down 45 and wozniacki was serving for the match in the third set . do you have a process when staging comebacks ? did you hit the reset button before you start hitting ball ?
yesterday was a pretty fun day for most of us watching how the scenarios were unplaying . we know sasha was at the match yesterday . he was tweeting . were ignoring everything that was going on or were you paying attention ?
you got to finish the year as no.1 , 12 years after the first time you did that , which is a record actually .
of all the records you have , how do you think that ranks and what does that mean to you ?
why do n't you like dramas ?
four matches into in tournament any drama with your knee ?
two questions : one , where would you say your serve is at the moment after today 's match ? and secondly , do you get nervous ?
do you get nervous in the match ?
if you end up playing radwanska in the final , how do you judge her as an opponent ? what are the keys to playing against her ?
they 're talking about making a movie out of li na 's life already . if they were going to make one out of your life , what genre would it be at least ?
could be a musical though .
tough end to the week , but still overall can you take positives from your experience here ?
simona told us that she used to struggle against you , felt like she mentally struggled against you . how would you say she 's changed over the past year ? you 've played here a couple times .
is it strange to kind of lose three matches in one tournament ? strange format , no ?
what was it about simona 's game today that perhaps you struggled a little bit against ?
the way the group wound up working out , you only got to the semifinals because you won second set against sharapova from 51 down . so is that more of a point of pride now than it was maybe right after that match ? that was what you needed to , save all the match points and do this ridiculous comeback .
you had a very long and tough match yesterday . you talked about ice baths . did you feel tired today on the court ?
obviously your season just ended . can you give some context of what you 're feeling like at the end of the year in terms your performances this year compared to the last couple years ?
offseason plans ?
right away ? will you go home ?
somewhere nearby here ?
congratulations . pretty straightforward win for you seemed like today . what was on the key to keeping everything going in your direction ?
it was your first wta finals semifinal , and so were you able to walk out on court without nerves and to play relaxed , or did it take some time to calm down ?
it must feel strange to beat serena , catch your breath from it , and then you have to go out and play her again .
do you think mentally it 's different to face serena in a round robin match and in a final ? will you prepare differently at all mentally ?
it 's fair to say that you surprised a few people at this tournament with your performances . are you surprised yourself at how well you 're doing ?
serena was probably favorite to win this tournament when it started . some people thought maybe because you had a chance to eliminate her from the tournament when you played ivanovic .
but some people thought that maybe there was reason for you to maybe do that , that it might logical to do that . did that ever cross your mind at that point ?
talk again about your thoughts about wanting give your full effort in that match .
a lot of people will be wondering how you could beat serena 6love , 62. what was the secret ? where do you think you had the advantage over her ?
so when you played serena , that was the first one of the year that you guys had ever played each other . what does that ...
second time in the same week , exactly . when it rains it pours . what does that match do for this match ? what did you learn from that match that you can take to this match ?
do you feel like besides the technical parts , like serve , return , serve , forehand , backhand , you still have to play a very good mind game against serena on the court .
i know you 're used to playing in regular tournaments all year , every day , but it 's never against top players throughout the whole week . is the intensity of this tournament , how are you handling to turnaround ? is there like adrenaline pushing you ? how are you doing it ?
considering you won 6love , 62 last time ...
i know . do you feel like the favorite tomorrow ?
this question is not about serena .
what have you been doing outside of the tennis court in singapore to just relax ? have you been able to stay away from all the shops ?
and then physically you 're feeling okay after everything ?
30 in the group . not bad . any sense that was coming when you got here ? you were the no.8 seed , so theoretically you were an underdog in every match .
did you have a little extra incentive that your friend needed you to win to get into the semis ?
you seemed really relaxed on court . is that a fair assessment ? how did you feel mentally on court ?
aga said she would take you shopping with her credit card .
we 're just about to see halep play a match , and she 's already qualified . what 's the mindset in that situation where you 're in a round robin , you 're already through ? anything feel different about the match ?
can you describe your last six months , how it 's been for you ?
six months ago did think you would be here in singapore playing the wta finals ?
just a note on your father coaching you . when i sit down with my daughter to coach her it ends up in tears . we always end up crying or fighting . how is it with your dad ? you seem to have a good relationship on court .
seems most likely opponent will be serena . how do you see that matchup going ? how do you think you matchup against her ?
just on the other two , you 're in the rare position you can play three different people next . halep or ivanovic . briefly each of them .
feel like you never missed a beat in terms of being in this elite level of the game ? because there was a stretch , i think cincinnati , you got a first top10 win in many months . there was a time when you were n't getting those wins regularly . now three in one week . does it feel like a change or does it feel like you never left ?
how would you describe your week so far ? how has it been for you ?
obviously your focus is just on the next match , but can you imagine yourself with the title ? would it help to imagine yourself with the trophy ?
since your ranking fell , is it maybe sweeter this time around than when you were here four years ago reaching the final ?
51 , second set , big transformation . how do you explain that ?
just wondering , stepping on the court , how aware are you of your qualification scenarios ? did you know when you won the match that you were n't through ?
maria , going through that second set , and as you kind of started to feel like maybe it might been slipping away or maybe the chances were coming and going , what was going through your mind ? was it a sense of panic ? dial down ? what 's happening mentally there ?
not angry though after the second set , so you 're saying what ? i want to go home now ? i need to play hard now ?
you want to talk the year now . were you very happy all year ? what were you thinking going out ?
speaking of the new team , with sven in particular , now that we 've had the full season , what is it exactly that he 's been able to add that 's been different from coaches in the past that has just contributed to you and to the team ?
looking forward next year , would say that getting the no.1 ranking is the top priority ?
in the shorter run , offseason plans , thoughts , anything you been longing for now that you get out of the hamster wheel for a bit ?
next year the coaches can have a tablet with the real time data to help in oncourt sessions . what do you think about that , and what do you think your coach thinks about that ?
three matches here . looking back on the those matches , what were you most disappointed with in your game ?
what will you take away from the tournament ?
just a quick one about the fans . you 're very , very popular here . a lot of fans on social media now are talking about the fact they 're disappointed you 're not going to play the weekend . and do you have a message for them ?
you mentioned going to tokyo , but are you planning on sticking around in singapore for a few days , having some fun ?
after a long season , is there ever a sense of relief that you can just put the racquet down and not look at it again for a few weeks ?
do we have a chance to see you maybe next week in paris for bnp paribas masters ?
did you know what the scenarios were for qualifying before the match ?
but in the second set , had maria won in straight sets , then that would 've obviously knocked you , i believe , out . did you know that ? and then did that kind of explain the fight back ?
if this was your last match of the year , does the way you fought back in that second set , even though you lost the match , make it an okay note to end on ?
if you do happen to make the semifinals , what do you think you would like to work on to be ready for that ?
your fate rests in the hands of your friend . did you give her an extra pep talk before she walked on the court ?
are you going to go out there and watch her ? there 's probably space left in her box . if she wins , you win , so might as well go out there .
if it was your last match of the year , how would you sum up your season ?
aga , obviously the round robin is specific to this tournament . i 'm wondering , especially with the white group there were so many different scenarios . how did you view that ? is it more exciting or nervewracking ? how do you view the situation that the group is in today .
in the event that this is the last time that we talk to you , i have to ask the question , what are you doing for vacation ?
aga , in the second set you were 51 down . what was going through your mind ? did something happen to inspire the comeback ?
in that second set that you hit that overhead ; you missed it badly . then after that , you completely relaxed and played as though , yeah , you had already checked out . was there a little bit of that ?
end of the season , compared to the previous few years , are you as tired year as you were last year , year before ? how would you compare how you feel physically at the end of this year compared to previous years ?
obviously disappointing week for you probably . what do you think just did n't work for you in the matches where you were n't able to get it your way ?
speaking of fed cup , why do you think that not everybody ends up playing it ? you 've always been one of the top players that commits to fed cup and plays it every year and seems to enjoy it . for whatever reason , nobody else does . why do you think that is ?
it 's been a long season . at this point in it , is there a bit of tiredness ?
how were the conditions for you this week overall ? you 've had a lot have success indoors in your career . was that different somehow ?
in the years past , you 've always had over the course of the season a struggling with health , like viruses or getting sick before tournaments . how was that for you this year ? was it better this year ?
so after fed cup , what are your offseason plans ? how are you going to relax ?
talk about the fed cup final . what do you expect from germany ? probably will be kerber and petkovic i 'm guessing as the singles players for them . how do you think that matchup will be ?
so i know your season has only been over for about an hour , but looking forward to 2015 , you said before that no.1 rankings do n't matter to you . it 's just about slams . as you look into a new season , what do you think of as goals ?
end your year with win . pretty good year for you even if you do n't advance . how do you feel at the end of all of it ?
talk about the second set . seemed like after the fight back in the first set that maybe you were physically or emotionally deflated . explain what happened in the second set .
when you were 25 down , i assume the whole scenario thing was in your head when you came roaring back .
i assume you knew of all the scenarios .
how does that change your attitude going into a match ?
incredible year overall . what are you most proud of that you did in 2014 ?
after the second set did you say to yourself , well , i 'm not going to get through to the is semis , i 'm just going to get through . it 's done for the night . or did you just push , push , push ?
you had a bit of a funny moment on court in the second set . parked yourself right on the chair after that dropshot . did that help just alleviate some of the stress and pressure during that time ?
i did n't say that was successful .
offseason plans ?
with the win , having won the match , you have an opportunity to finish top 5 at the end of the season .
it 's not in your hands . it depends on the rest of the results this week . but i 'm curious , looking back on the season , at what point during this year do you think you thought , wow , this type of season could happen ?
so next year are the slams the most important thing from now on ?
who do you think is going to win ? four players left .
you said over the last few years that it 's a process . you said it constantly . is it safe to say that it 's paid off ?
considering your coach only came and joined your team after wimbledon , during the offseason will you try some new approach with him to do the training to prepare for the next season ?
what do you think will be the biggest key to sustain this success into next year ?
looking at the offseason , i know you have n't thought about it at all , but in the past , even though the offseason is so short , does it feel like it 's a block of time that you can catch up on life , the life you have to ignore sometimes because of tennis ? if so , what are the things you prioritize that you want to catch up on ?
you slept ?
what was it like playing a match knowing you were already through ? did that change anything for you or feel like a normal match out there ?
stakes were probably higher for serena than you in this match . if you had lost in straight sets serena would 've been eliminated . did you hear anything from her or her team about that ?
it was a physical match against ana tonight , and probably very exhausting . now you have to turn around and play the semifinals tomorrow . at some point during the match did you start to think , i need to save some energy ?
how do you think your matchup against aga ?
is it hard to come back for another match after the huge , huge win you had over serena ?
how long did the feeling of beating serena last ? next day were you still smiling all the time or thinking back to it ? describe the last 48 hours .
you said i think last year that beating radwanska , in madrid or rome
that that was a big match for and that kicked off your entire last couple of years . i 'm wondering if that mental block against her , thinking that you were never good enough to beat her , is that gone ?
just wondering , after beating serena , did you receive any good messages from people back in romania ? are they happy for you for such a big win ?
can you give us some sense of how popular you are back home ? can you walk down the street without being recognized ?
so how do you go out to dinner or how do you go shopping back home ?
can you remember the first time someone screamed at you on the street ?
congratulations .
that was a very tough first set , and then eventually in the second you started to pull away . what were the differences that you were able to find at the key moments ?
is it mixed emotions , because you got a wonderful victory today , but liverpool got handsomely beaten by real madrid last night ; 3nil .
no , arsenal .
do i look pleased ? i 'm sorry .
we got extremely fortunate .
you 've just had a wonderful tennis victory so we 're both smiling . so that 's good .
such is life . thank you . there was a moment where she did hit one of those sublime shots and you kind of cracked a smile a little bit . is she one of those players that can just hit a shot that all you can do is just shake your head and walk away ?
what have you been most pleased with over the first two matches here ?
do you wish there was more of an indoor season ? you come to this tournament pretty much after playing asia outdoors and there is not much buildup to it .
would you like to see more big tournaments ? right now none of the mandatories or 5s are ?
you get petra next . thoughts on that ?
some really great momentum now for you moving forward . feel like you 're one of the favorites to win the tournament ?
the wta has announces that next year your dad could come out with a tablet that shows stats . do you think that your father would like having that access , and could you imagine what that would be like ?
the tablet ?
looked like it felt a lot better than yesterday . how different did it feel just one day to the next on court ?
your fate in this tournament rests now on the next match . what will you be doing ? will you watch it ? go to sleep and just forget about it ?
when you were talking to patrick , was it mostly a mental kind of discussion about getting everything kind of right upstairs , or were there tactical or technical or rhythm issues ? what was the thrust of the conversation ?
i 'm sure you want to win every point , every game out there , but how aware are you at this stage how important every game really is to you qualifying for the next round ?
what are you planning to do tomorrow ? practice even though you might not have another match ?
moments like these ever make you appreciate how straightforward tennis is most of the time ? a lot of the league sports teams are dependant on what other teams do and stuff and you have to keep watching the scoreboard . pretty much you always control your own destiny in tennis .
i 'm wondering why do you think that is , after everything you 've accomplished that you can still get so down on yourself ?
can i ask have you received an apology from mr. tarpischev ? has that weighed on your mind this week ?
did you speak to him or was it written ?
if this is the last we see you this year , because it 's possible , what might your offseason have in store for you ?
to florida ?
you 've been around long enough to know a lot of different ways the calendar has worked out . right now there is not really an indoor season . do you miss an indoor season on the calendar ?
what did you particular like about indoor ?
bunch of success in your last few matches against her , and today at times it was n't all that close . what went differently today ?
did you feel sharper in your first match than you did tonight ?
can you talk about whether things were on your mind during the match . obviously race for no.1 is a conversation point and advancing to the semifinals . any of that weighing in your head in those matches ?
there is n't much of an indoor season anymore . you 've been playing long enough on tour to know there was a fuller european leadup to the yearend finals . do you wish there was still more a part of year that was more dedicated to playing indoors ?
did you miss the cold or like chasing summer around the globe ?
she had n't beaten you since 2011. did she play aggressive ? was she better ? did it change a little bit ?
so is it slow out there ? in the middle ? fast ?
yeah .
it 's been a long and fruitful season for you . are you tired at all ?
it was a very close first set , and then seemingly she sort of pulled away near the end . she got ahead and stayed ahead . is that what you felt ? how did you feel the match went overall ?
how much different a player is she right now do you think since wimbledon ? so she 's had a lot of wins and seems to be more aggressive . you 've played her a lot , so how have you noticed the changes in her game ?
did you think the marathon helps with that ?
for yourself and for all players , when you reach this stage of the year , is there a longterm fatigue that sets in ? are you still finding it difficult to get up the enthusiasm and the physical power ?
you had some incredible shots during the match . when you play like that and still lose the match , what does it feel like ?
there are less and less indoor tournaments for you that you guys play . i think you played maybe one other this year in katowice and that was it .
do you wish there was more sort of an indoor season where you got a chance to get used to the conditions ?
do you wish some of the biggest tournaments though , like a premier mandatory or premier 5 that were indoor ?
given that caroline is physically strong as you mentioned , how mentally tough is it to lose the first set for you ?
maria next . thoughts on that matchup ?
you 've had some wins over her on some big occasions . miami final and the us open . when you have beaten her , what do you think is the key when you can win those matches ?
good to get a trophy after two matches . not bad .
you played much better today . how did it feel to beat maria for the first time in a few years ?
as ben said , it had been a while since you had beaten maria . did you need a win like this over her to help your confidence at all or turn the rivalry around ?
how much are you going to pay attention to the math coming up in this third match ? maybe you need a certain number of games to qualify for the semifinals .
how much do you like indoors ? do you wish there was more of an indoor season ? there is no real stretch of tournaments where you get to play indoors and get used to them .
your racquet looks a little different this week . can you talk about the decision to change and also the timing , to do to before this tournament .
is the racquet different other than the colors than the one you were using throughout the rest of the year ?
can i ask how many pairs of tennis shoes do you carry with you to a tournament ?
and for a grand slam ?
does all of this media stuff and all the stuff that you do to get that little trophy up there , does it tire you out ? does it exhaust you sometimes at the tournaments ?
it seems from our perspective that you 're much better with the media side of things now than maybe you were when you won wimbledon back in 2011. at what point did you become comfortable with it ? how did you kind of get used to the fact that everyone starts asking you questions every single day ?
overall not the week you wanted , but positives to take out of this experience at all , being here ?
now that the season is over , we can sit and assess the last 10 months . how would you kind of recap your season and really what did you learn this year ?
how much of your struggle this week would you put down to the limited preparation and the injury problems , and how much of it is just disappointment in the way you performed ?
your first time playing in this tournament . was there anything you felt you were not really prepared for ? i mean , the unique format of this event , was there anything you feel that you probably were not ready to cope with ?
the fire , you tweeted before that it felt like the hunger games .
luckily the stakes are a little lower in tennis .
so what are your offseason plans then ? looking forward to getting time away from the tour .
i think you 're playing the iptl , right ?
what was kind of the rationale in deciding to play it ? what were your thoughts on all that ?
this was a pretty spectacular first full lap on the tour for you this year . what does lap two look like , do you think ?
is that as easily said as done ? you 'll be a much higher seed at slams , points to defend at big events . those will all be new experiences for you .
how is the media side and the attention , the offcourt stuff been for you ? has that been 100 % enjoyable or have there been things that have been surprising or disappointing , whatever ?
obviously that did n't go anywhere close to how you wanted it to . what did you feel was not working for you out there today ?
did you have any inkling in the warmup or before the match that your game was maybe not at its best today ?
you played her before , but over a year ago , and she 's really made a big move this year . how different was she than what you expected or remembered from her ?
you looked obviously frustrated on court . you look a little bit emotional now . can you talk about why this is frustrating or why particularly you 're feeling the way you are ?
you did have those two chances to break back in the final game . do you think if you did that she might 've got a bit nervous and you could have turned the momentum back around ?
ton of unforced errors from you , which is unusual . did you try to change a little bit ? the forehand was n't usually working for you , which you usually dominate with .
unlike most tournaments , you lose here and you can keep going at this point . how did you reboot and shake this off ?
do you like that you getting to back out there in two days ? is that a positive ? negative ?
you mentioned your serve and your forehand , but also did you feel you were moving as well as you could have ? was there anything bothering you with your movement ?
you changed racquets more than usual . was something not feeling right on that front ?
so 100 % you feel okay ? are you moving well ? does the leg hurt ?
pretty comprehensive start to finish . seemed to be pretty much in control for that match . how did you feel out there ?
you were really consistent at the net today . how happy were you with that .
you said you wanted to enjoy and savor the tournament . are there certain moments during the match where you snap yourself out of playing the match and kind of , i do n't know , soak it all in , or is it just a matter of playing and focusing and enjoying it later ?
you 've been on the receiving end of some of the biggest ovations from the fans . are you surprised by kind of how you 've been welcomed here in singapore ?
historically you have a great result playing in this part of the world . amazing result in bali . do you think you can translate it here ? it 's not that far from here :
i 'm sure you 're still happy about tonight , but looking forward a little bit , serena and genie play tomorrow , but you play the day after . you 'll know exactly how many games , or you might know exactly how many games it takes to advance .
so when were you counting ? you were counting everyone 's games in the group ?
before tonight you have not beaten genie before . also at the australian open you were saying that her game was hard to read . how did you overcome that tonight and come out on top ?
have you watched the match of the serena and simona ?
ana , you mentioned that you might have changed a couple things after the last meeting with genie . can you talk a little bit about what those are ? did she not do some things tonight that she might have done in previous matches that also made the difference , in addition to your playing a really good match ?
back to australia . quarters ; you lost ; good match . did it take like a month , two months after that ? you could have won . would 've been a big win . semifinal again . were you thinking about it a lot ?
so you just saw serena two days ago , and then she loses easily today . a little bit of a shock losing so quickly knowing how good she is ?
i think before today you had lost 19 out of 20 matches again top5 ranked players . you beat her today . do you think now you have the game ...
that 's what i was going to ask : do you think now you have the confidence and the game to be able to beat those top players ?
you beat serena .
blame the wta .
i 'll ask you something not about statistics . novak .
just want to get your thoughts on that . you have known him since you guys were kids and now he 's got a kid . how did you find out about the news ?
i 'm guessing you 're going to be smiling the rest of the day ?
yeah . what do you think happened out there ?
how pleased were you with how you handled those break points ? you faced the more than one , especially in the second set , but always played them quite calmly .
beating serena williams 6love , 62 , could you ever even dream about that before doing it ?
before the tournament you said you were n't putting any pressure on yourself and you just want the experience . now that you 're 20 and have beaten serena , are you feeling more confident about actually going farther ?
you had never beaten a top 3 player before this . how aware were you of that ? and then to break through with such a big win over no.1 , does that make you feel like you can do anything now ?
so many different things you 've accomplished this year : no.2 , first premier title , slam final . where does this win rank among all of those things you 've done ?
serena said she 's never seen you play like that before . do you think like as an individual match that it 's best you 've played ?
next year the wta will launch stats for the coach , live stats . do you think it will change something in the game ?
you said you will be partying after this tournament .
how does simona halep party then ?
serena was saying she will go home and work hard and especially train for you . did you ever train for somebody before a match against some players ?
you started out 60 , 20 ; how surprised were you at that point ? what was going through your mind ?
when you are leading are you always calm ? there is no like , oh , my gosh , i am up 6love , 2love ?
from serena 's side , what surprised you the most ? what do you think failed her the most ? what were you expecting that did n't happen ?
yeah , for her game .
you have n't been broken through your first two matches . been holding serve fairly well and defending your break points . how surprised are you by that , and why do you think you 've been successful on your service games ?
genie , i heard you saying when nick was out there you felt like it was tough to feel like you were ready for this tournament . obviously it 's great to be here , but maybe not quite as prepped as you want to be . you feel it during the matches , i guess .
what do you think she did differently today ?
strange you had a much higher first serve percentage than her but you could n't convert that into winning points on your first serve . how do you account for that ?
where do you think the rust shows the most ? is it in the serve ? certainly velocity is not there . is it location ? you feel like the confidence takes the biggest hit to what part of your game ?
you talked throughout the year about trying to play your brand of tennis no matter what all the time . when things are n't working , do you feel like you have a plan b , or do you have to sort of keep trying your game until hopefully it starts working ?
on court , do you feel like this is still like an enjoyable experience ? i know it 's hard to play when you feel like you have one arm tied behind your back . has this been a good experience ? are there positives you can take out of the last two matches ?
serena next . i do n't know if you saw any of her match today , but she had a weird one . thoughts on what it may be like going in to play her , especially with her coming off that ?
you left lagardre this year . can you tell us if you have a new agent ?
how does it feel being free ?
this is the first time you 're playing in the wta finals . after two games , has it overwhelmed you in the sense ?
given the struggling to play at your best at the moment , back to back matches , are you 100 % sure you 'll be able to play tomorrow , or will you assess that at some point ?
with this win and also the win at the us open , wondering if you think that you have an edge if this match goes to three sets against her ? just physically and mentally seems you 've been able to outlast her in these tough , grueling matches .
in terms of the second set , the lights , seemed to be some be issues . she was talking a little bit about how they 've changed throughout the week . what was your issue with the lights there ? you seemed to stop a few times .
after that line call in the second set , have you ever gotten that angry on the court before ?
at the beginning of the third set your father gave you quite a big pep talk and had a big affect . what did he say and did it have an affect ?
and you paid heed to the advice ?
just back to the poor line call , how do you get back from such anger and disappointment over a point like that ? what did you tell yourself just to calm down ?
on the one hand , winning a match in this fashion could be perceived as draining . in a round robin format to overcome your opponent in this fashion , does that give you momentum going forward ?
you spoke a little bit in jest there about the marathon , the running training . if it does help you , is this something you would maybe do in future years ? would you recommend it to other players ?
do you remember 2009 , wta , playing vika . played almost three hours , all of that . just talk a little bit about that . what were you thinking at the time ? how good was it ? were you too young ? all that . so were you actually tired ? because you never get tired .
right .
after two very , very close first two sets , what do you think sort of got away from you in the third ?
nine double faults in the first set . is that just a product of rustiness coming into the first match of a tournament or something else ?
we are seeing you 're trying a lot of things you 're not using in your game , like dropshot or slice backhand . was it part of the plan ?
do you think that fitness had anything to do with ...
lots of issues with the lights today . do you think that fitness had any impact on this third set for you ?
speaking of the lights , how was it out there ? she seemed to be having a lot of problems or complaints about them in the second set . from what you could tell , how were they ?
just as a follow up on that , is it a glare issue or sight line with the lights ?
just generally , how frustrating of a loss is this for you ? is it frustrating ? is it not ? we do n't want to assume .
you 've always tended to kind of hit drive volleys instead of smashes . do you just dislike hitting smashes ?
or when a lob comes up or something .
the first couple sets were an epic battle and the crowd loved it . what are the biggest positives for you moving forward ? you 've got another match .
long match . over three hours . how do you feel recovery will be going into at least two more matches here ?
it happens very rarely that you lose two in a row to the same opponent . are you uncomfortable playing her kind of ?
as you say , you lost and you are frustrated . in the round robin format it 's different to lose in two sets or in three sets with two tiebreaks , because you could be always qualified even at the end .
is it easier to stomach a loss like this when you know you 're playing two more matches and you can put it right ?
caroline almost never gets tired still , every single time you play her these days , huh ? two hours , three hours whenever she 's out there . how tough is that ?
were you surprised at all by how well you were able to play today ? you had n't had a lot of success against her , and today 's match was pretty lopsided in your favor .
have you ever worn a dress with butterflies on it before ?
obviously we know you can win big tournaments , big titles , be in slam finals . at the yearend championships you 've struggled to play your best . why ? is it because it 's indoor , a surface you do n't like ? mentally at the end of the year ?
is there any mental component to it ? some players go to a tournament they have n't done well at and automatically think they 're not going to do well here . do you have any of that with respect to this tournament ?
the wait for your match to start was quite long . the match before you was three and a half hours . how did you stay focused and what were you doing ?
probably play caroline next . she won today . what 's that matchup like ?
seems like she 's been playing more aggressive since wimbledon maybe . had a lot of success on the u.s. hard courts and now here . you played her in cincinnati , too . did you notice a change in her game ?
you really dominated petra 's second serve today . was that a matter of you attacking it more or was she serving below her best ?
it was a convincing victory then . you mentioned still a long way to go . how good and how confident are you feeling moving forward ?
was that just a bad day at the office for you ?
long match before you guys , so did that wait have any affect on you ? what did you do to pass the time ?
you 've had a lot of success against her before . she seemed to be playing some of her best tennis . was there something different she was doing that threw you off than in past matches , do you think ?
you have n't had the chance to play many top10 players this year . is it difficult coming in first match at this tournament to go right up to that level ?
i think both you and maria were probably expected to win today by the rankings . with the underdogs winning both matches in the group today , does it change things going forward ? shake it up a bit for you ?
not yet , no .
before your match , the camera cut into kind of the player warmup area . do you know what i 'm about to ask you ?
does david normally bounce a ball off your head before matches , or just today ?
maybe not again ?
in the match before you the players complained a bit about the lights . do you feel that the lights have been weird during the week in practice or today ?
you 're probably going to play maria next . thoughts on that match ?
now that you 've played a match on this centre court , how would you rate the speed ? would you like it to be faster ? slower ? higher bouncing ? lower bouncing ?
have you ever played on an indoor or any sort of court that was too fast ? you played on it and thought that was too fast ?
prague ?
so you liked it ? you did n't think it was too fast for you ?
you came into the match having had some injury troubles . did you have any trepidation , any worries coming in here that you would be able to perform at your best ?
how did you feel out there on the knee and everything else ?
is it hard to summon that sort of intensity for the first set of a tournament ? it got ratcheted up pretty quickly from both of you .
ana said that one of the keys to the match was the serve . yours was a lot better than hers . what are your comments on that ?
the first matches can always be a little tricky . just curious , what were you most pleased with about your game today ?
can you remember the first time you decided to do the splits on the court ?
did you just randomly bust it out during the match ?
caroline was watching ringside tonight . will you be coming for her match tomorrow , and how do you see her chances against maria ?
going back to the match with ana , your serve was obviously pivotal . there were one or two moments were it was pretty delicately poised . do you put that down to your experience in this tournament ?
there were one or two moments where ana was more in the match , i suppose , and it seemed like your experience was showing through .
obviously opening night ; big ceremony . how did you enjoy the crowd and the lights and everything and the noise that the crowd was making throughout the match ?
back to the splits . you 've played against kim clijsters who used to do that a lot . is that something you worked at in practice or for flexibility , or is it something that came out of nowhere ? you did it a few times today especially .
when you walk onto the court and you 've got the lights flashing and the fireworks , a dark arena , do you have to watch the way you 're walking so you do n't get lost or trip ?
serena , you were joking on court that you 're going hoarse because you shouted so many , c'mons .
was that like an instinctual primal thing , or were you doing it more to get yourself into the match and intense ? was it like a reflex intensional ?
you had played ana many times this year , but your next two opponents you have n't played this year . have you seen much of them , and how will you prepare for these matches ?
does it still feel like you 're a defending champion even though it 's in a completely different city ?
related to that , i think that 's 16 straight wins at wta finals . are you aware of those streaks ? do they matter or do they just happen ?
very competitive match except when it really mattered at the end of each set .
just the atmosphere out there , playing on that arena for the first time , what was it like ? how were the conditions ?
how were the lights ? it seemed like both of you especially early on were having a lot of double fault issues , maybe toss into the lights or something ?
it was a tough service day for you . was that just an issue of nerves ? just a bad day ? do you have any explanation for it ?
is your takeway from this match one of , it was so close i had it ; i 'm disappointed ; or is it that despite all that , a bad service day , you still were able to create some chances ? is it a positive or negative experience ?
you had an incredible number of really good dropshots today . was that part of your strategy with her going in ? she 's had movement issue with the knee lately . or was that just normal tactics ?
is it more difficult to play serena in your first match of the tournament compared to usually three or four matches down the line ?
do you still think about your volley at 44 , 3040 in the first set ?
currently there are a couple girls born in the '90s playing right now . do you feel like a veteran ?
that seemed to go really well for you . did you expect it to go so well ?
you walked out on court with a bit of a smile .
how different does this tournament feel from anything else you 've ever done ?
can you tell us since wimbledon , the change between your matchup against genie , what do you think has changed with your game and her game since then ?
your first appearance at the wta finals . do you come here thinking this is just an opportunity for experience , or do you think you really have a chance to do something at this tournament ?
we do n't know who you play next . do you know ?
right , so serena .
you have n't played serena yet this year , so what is tat going to be like for you ? and it 's surprising , because you were 2 and 2 for a while .
how different will you feel about going into that match than last year when you played her ? you 've obviously won a lot since then .
were you happy with your movement today ?
was it better than you expected ?
has it been easy to forget about your recent results and injuries coming here ?
the buildup to this tournament seems bigger for the players in terms of all of the photos you have to do and all the press .
what was that like for you ? that 's a lot of stuff to do for the first time .
everything seemed to work fairly well out there , despite the shots that just come from nowhere ?
do you learn something each time you play her ?
i know every match is different , but seems like a few of the matches you 've played , cincinnati and the us open finals , takes you some time to find your range . is that sort of the rhythm of playing a player like serena , that it takes an hour to figure out what 's working and hit your own stride perfectly ?
i guess one of the keys against her was your serve and her serve . she 's obviously got one of the greatest of all time . it 's hard to break her . she puts pressure on you to hold consistently , which is n't easy either , no ?
are you the type of player you just finish a match and you want to go back out and play a bit more because you think you 're getting close ?
does it have any affect on your confidence so close to a grand slam ?
how would you grade your level this week ? i do n't mean confidence or mental , just technically . how do you really feel like you played from the beginning all the way through today ?
first tournament of the season . how are the joints ?
what are you expecting going into melbourne ? defending champion is a new experience for you . last year you seemed to handle it pretty well . what 's it 's like going back to that slam that 's obviously been good for you ?
are you a superstitious person ? do you try to do the same things heading to melbourne as you did last year and the year before ?
is she the one player on tour you pretty much can not afford any dips in level ? i mean serena . more than like a game or a few points ?
do you have one strongest memory from the australian open that stands out above the rest ?
do you expect to be meeting serena in the final of australian open ?
take any positives , or really just missed some chances there in the second set ?
serena talked about feeling like she got thrown into the deep end having to play a player of your caliber the first week of the season . do you feel that way ?
just talk about the serving in the second set . it 's hard it make her as much as you broke her during that set , but you also get broken a lot . was that first serve percentage on your part , too ? her 's was a little bit low . was it the great returning ?
what about is sven ? how is working with him ? is it going well ?
when you 're involved in all those intense points and you had a lot of them during the second set are all the thoughts of , oh , i only played a few matches since wimbledon out your head and you 're out there in a match again it and does n't matter what was happening beforehand ?
when you 're out there playing the super intense points against serena , are the thoughts of what you had to do to get to brisbane just gone ?
did you surprise yourself in anyway about your level in that second set tonight ?
after three matches coming back from an injury , it 's a pretty rapid rise .
will you take a lot of confidence out of your performance tonight moving into the australian open ?
with sven , you called him on court after three games in the second set . wondering about the timing of that . you had just broken her . always curious about when people decide to talk to coaches or not . why then ?
what did he talk about out there ?
shoulder give you any trouble tonight or this week ?
14 straight losses now to serena . does it feel different than a loss to another opponent ? so many at this point . is it numbing to lose to her or still the same as ...
is it a lesser kind of frustration i guess losing to a top player ?
you came out playing really unbelievably well the first set . do you think just that first game of the second set changed the momentum ?
as soon as that point happened and she guessed right , were we were thinking that may be a turning point .
yeah , what happened there ?
she 's no.2 in the world . is that a good indicator of where you are against the top girls ?
do you have another tournament to play before melbourne ?
you said probably . so you 're not sure ? you got a lot of matches in here .
i 'm not sure . i do n't know if you get a bye there yet .
so is marko going to be with you ?
how is it not having him here this week ?
who were you with ?
did you expect to have the crowd on her side playing her today ?
yeah . definitely .
you did n't notice that ?
we were talking about this last night , the satisfaction of the struggle . bit of a struggle today , but you played another good third set and took care of it at the end . about the match and your feelings .
you talked about that one point where you guessed right and she had a backhand that went right to you . do you feel like that changed the momentum of the match ? do you feel that one point , even though it was pretty early in the second set , felt things pretty suddenly going your way ?
what does that feel like when you win a point that feels that big ?
do you feel like you need to step up another level for the final ?
you made the final here in 2009 , and now you 're here in 2014. do you remember the excitement back then and what the feeling was like ?
why did you decide to come to brisbane again and not sydney ? is it because of the extra week ?
is this kind of what you guys want the first week of the year , two weeks before slam ? jelena or maria or serena , the world 's best ? we have the exact same semifinals in melbourne . is it too early for that , or is this the perfect preparation ?
much different matchups against serena or maria than jelena . talk about that . a little bit more offensive players than she is , no ?
roland garros semis .
what do you remember about the last time you played maria , that final in melbourne ? what do you remember about that match ?
what do you remember the emotion being like ?
you were saying you were in the zone . how often does that happen , say , annually when you 're in a match and you go into the zone and every ball is going in ?
you 're a good analyst . take a look at serena versus maria , which you may or may not see tonight .
will you watch ?
because why ? because you know them both so well it does n't really matter ?
you had two wins over serena last year . do you feel like you 'll be able to continue staying close to her in 2014 now ?
you knew it was going to a long match probably going in , huh ?
she plays a lot balls back and plays good . you outlasted her after the first set .
you talked about the light . you 've played three matches out there now with the covers . wonder what those are like to play with , because it 's pretty unusual to have them .
in general have you like getting shade under that ?
talk about the intensity level of playing azarenka . you played at the championships . this will be your tenth time playing her so you obviously know her well . you knew her when she was younger . you were on top of her then , and she got on top and now you 're back to sort of the same level almost , no ?
cincinnati .
you 're relatively quiet on court . i know you celebrate but do n't grunt that much . can you hear victoria when you 're playing ?
how was the offseason for you ?
was that the first time you were n't in florida at all during an offseason ?
you get the same level of competition with other players and people to practice with in dubai ?
just talk us through what happened at the end of that second set there . do you know ? are you able to pick out what was going on ? was it just one of those moments ?
is it good to have i guess a moment like that leading up to a slam just perhaps to bring that focus to your mind ?
what did you tell yourself when you were feeling frustrated when that match points were n't going your way ?
did you debrief with your team out there , sam ? was anything raised ?
have you had a similar experience as a junior or in the pros where you 've had that many match points , lost them , and come back and won the third set ?
that hold in the first game of the third set pretty important , no ?
looking forward to the semifinal clash with jelena tomorrow ?
couple things . you said about the changes in your team in the last two pressers . you made changes ; novak made changes ; federer . you had a pretty successful year , so why make any changes going into the new year ?
you think they can relate to you better as woman being women themselves ? is that part of it ?
you wish there were more women around the wta tour in terms of coaches ? very , very few women coaches on tour . would you like to see that change in later generations ?
comment on jelena . you played her a couple times last year : cincinnati , the championships . she 's experienced and tough . you have a good headtohead record , quick turnaround . could be a long one , no ?
the match against jelena and then if you make it to the final ...
i 'm just sort of saying in terms open preparation , you could n't ask for better sort of match practice , could you ?
what is your overall take on that match , and then talk specifically about the third set . seems you raised your level across the board .
compared to last year at this time when you were out with the shoulder injury , how does it feel to be having such a good year , winning the french open , fourth title , second in the ranking ?
your previous two matches you came out very aggressive , especially compared to this match where you came out a little flat . any reason you think it was harder to get momentum in the beginning of this match ?
considering what you achieved in the big tournaments this year , one grand slam , two mandatory premiere titles , also number one in the race for the championship , do you think you are the most consistent player this year on the tour ?
how did you feel ? how was your endurance at the end of the match ? it went pretty long . at times kvitova looked like she was faltering a little bit . how did you feel ?
yearend no.1 is now on the table for you . would you consider changing your schedule at all , playing other tournaments , or are you just going to head into the finals ?
what is the plan for the next 10 days ? you 'll be staying in china or travel back to the states ?
where ?
you are now ranked second on the road to singapore . the score between you and serena is less than 500 points . you have a good chance of winning your first yearend ranking no.1 at singapore . what do you think about it ? do you have a good chance ?
throughout this year , after coming back from the shoulder injury , was there ever a moment where you were more concerned about the shoulder than not ?
you 've been to singapore many times and there are a lot of fans in singapore waiting for you . this is actually the first time singapore holds the finals . i 'm sure there will be a lot of fans cheering for you . what is your impression of singapore ? do you have any plans to meet up with the fans in singapore ? are you going to sell the sugarpova in singapore ?
last week when you were in wuhan you did n't get a good result . how did you in such a short time adjust your form and win a title here in china ? in the last several matches you have done really well . how did you do that ?
did the fact that you 've played 10 matches in the last 13 days finally catch up with you out there ? how do you explain what happened in the third set specifically ?
what did she do today that really gave you problems ?
we know that singapore is coming in two weeks . is there anything you think you need to work on , small things , for you to get prepared for the wta finals ?
yesterday you said when you play against maria , it 's the little things . sometimes in the important points , she plays them better . do you think that 's what happened today ? if so , are there any specific points that stand out to you ?
over the course of the last two weeks , wuhan and here , what did you learn about yourself or your game ? what are you going to take with you as you leave china ?
if there 's going to be one thing you 're going to miss after you leave china , what do you think it 's going to be ?
you have signed img recently . do they have some special arrangement for you ?
do they have some special arrangement for you , some example , activities or news ?
are you going to take a rest before singapore or play some other tournaments ?
we know that you are close to the world no.1 . now your ranking is no.3 . next year before wimbledon , your ranking may improve further . you may be no.1 . what is your expectation on it and will it give you more pressure ?
a very fast start for you , very aggressive game . talk us through what your mentality was coming into this match and how you were able to close it out in the end after a very long service game .
in the last game , you had some doublefaults , as well . did you feel some pressure to get that game done with and get the match done with ? is that why so much trouble with the serve ?
speaking of the serving , nine aces over two sets is a pretty good clip for you . was that a tactical thing , and maybe that 's why the doublefaults were racking up as well ? that stat sticks out in your matches .
do you feel like the china open is on your bucket list because you have n't won this tournament before ? obviously this year is going to be a great chance . how about try to win it ?
against petra , she 's obviously a highly offensive player and players can get caught between wanting to be offensive or dropping back and forcing her to rack up errors . what is your mentality going into that match ?
what are your thoughts on your match as a whole ?
you called the doctor and trainer out . what was going on there ? also , how difficult was it to have that 30minute break while the roof closed ?
can you talk about how difficult it is to play two weeks in a row , make the finals both weeks , just to keep your energy levels up ?
you mentioned that you felt unwell . was that anything to do with the pollution , and in particular with the asthma which you suffer from ?
on that subject , it might interest you to know that the united states have a website which measures air quality . today 's air quality in beijing is called 'unhealthy ' and recommends that people with respiratory illnesses should n't exert themselves outside for more than 30 minutes .
if you win the title tomorrow , you will be ranked no.2 . have you ever thought about it ?
can you talk about either maria or ana who you will play in the final .
when you get into those matches against maria where it might be very tight , does her reputation as being a fighter , somebody who shouts , almost gets in your face across the net , does that play in your head ? is there an intimidation factor with her for you ?
can you compare your 2011 season and this season . you won the wta finals and wimbledon both . is it much better this season ?
you said you had some trouble sleeping last night . you look a little tired . do you know why ?
the past two weeks are so fantastic for you . you have played phenomenal tennis . how will you prepare for tomorrow 's match , because whoever the opponent will be it will be tough .
what was going through your mind after the last challenge ?
energywise , was it just a matter of the play catching up to you ? i saw some tape on your leg . what accounted for the flatness ?
you 're the second player to sit there and say they could n't sleep last night . petra was struggling with it as well . was there any particular reason ?
with already qualifying , are you planning to take the next couple weeks off and rest and be prepared for singapore or stay with the schedule you had ?
what kind of positive things do you think you can take away from the china open this week ?
how would you describe your rivalry with maria sharapova ?
how surprised were you with how well she was serving ? nine aces . looked like it had more pop than she 's had in the past . from your perspective , what were you seeing ?
you made it clear at the beginning of the year to go back to the top 10 and qualify for singapore are your goals . do you have any new goals for now or will you wait till the season finishes and go from there ?
it was a tough match last night . we noticed you had a bandaid on your left knee . will it influence your preparation for singapore ?
can you say when you started to feel the pain in the knee ? was it this week , earlier in the week ? how did it feel last night specifically ?
were you feeling it while you were in movement or just standing there ? was it throbbing ? can you describe the pain ?
are you going to go back to the states or to europe ? what is your plan at this point ?
this is the second tournament you 've had to retire early from . just explain the frustration about that .
are you feeling the grind of the tour a little bit more this year compared to years past , or is it always hard at the end of the year to remain healthy and keep the intensity level up ? can you compare this year to years previous ?
just to clarify , this feels a little bit worse than just typical endoftheseason fatigue for you ?
you 've always said that the grand slams are the big thing for you . you worked extremely hard to get back to world no.1 . do you feel pressure at all to keep world no.1 with what you do away from the slams , playing in other tournaments ?
venus also withdrew from her match yesterday . did she tell you anything about that ?
at the end of each season , a lot of players withdraw from matches due to various injuries . do you think health is the utmost factor to remain competitive when you want to wrap up the whole season ?
we all know you are a perfectionist . you always want to improve yourself . what is your motivation for everything ?
so the wta finals in singapore , at this point are you just going to wait and see ? is your participation in doubt at this point ?
as for your dress at the gala , it is very special . did you choose this dress for yourself ?
can you talk about the doctor in europe ? is he the permanent doctor for you ? what is his evaluation of your knee situation ? do you need to go back to europe to deal with your knee ?
you faced kuznetsova in wuhan . was that match on your mind at all today ?
last week you were saying you were still struggling with intournament consistency . i 'm wondering where you feel and how would you rate your tournament so far this week on that level ?
is there any difference when you play against players from russia and other countries ?
will you pay your attention to the previous match or just focus on your own game , just do some warming up ?
can you talk about your next matchup against ana , what you expect out of that , how you prepare for it differently this time ?
is the yearend no.1 on your mind at all ?
serena williams quit and halep quit . is it a pity for you or is it easier for you to get the title ?
have you talked to the russian federation whether you are going to play fed cup for next year ?
this time at the china open , your candy sold very well . what is your favorite in terms of this ?
will you give the fans the sugarpova for free or give them a discount if you win the next match ?
this is not your decision to give them discounts ?
petra , can you talk about the start of the match today . a bit of a slow start for you . was it something about her game that gives you problems ?
you won in wuhan last week . you 're two games away from winning here . what is it about china that you seem to enjoy playing here ?
you could have played both williams sisters in this tournament and you end up playing neither . first , can you comment on serena 's withdrawal . obviously she 's having some injury problems . how do you manage to keep fit at the end of the season when so many other players have problems with injuries ?
do you sense a different kind of energy in the locker room over the last couple weeks in this part of the season ? is there energy in the locker room ? are people kind of ready for the season to be over ? what is your sense ?
in the second set when you served for advantage , you called your coach to the court for guidance . after you won the first set against peng shuai , you called your coach to the court . how important is it for you to get guidance from your coach during the match ?
you are a nice player on the tour , very popular in china , like your friend li na . how do you deal with the relationship with other girls on and off court ?
last year when you came here you played a lot of threeset games . this year you have finished the match in two sets . does it mean you play more efficiently this year ?
speaking of david , when he comes down on court , he seems very calm , relaxed . has he ever gotten mad at you on court during a coaching period ?
does winning the inaugural wuhan open give you more confidence at the china open ? what is your expectation of the wta final in singapore ?
at li na 's retirement ceremony , your speech was very touching . you have won a lot of fans in china . i saw a lot of fans are cheering for you today . what do you want to say to the chinese fans ?
in the first set you were essentially dominant . it looked like it would be an easy match for you . halfway through the second set , suarez navarro came back . what do you think changed and brought you to that tiebreaker ?
you have good results on indoor courts . today with a closed roof , do you think it 's an advantage for you ?
you mentioned your loss to her in montral . did that affect your mindset going into this game ? anything you were looking to avoid that happened in montral ?
there are a lot of fans shouting , i love you . how does it affect your performance ?
it seemed as if your opponent was having trouble returning your serve today . how do you think you were able to be so effective with that ?
it must have felt good to be back indoors . i 'm wondering , when you see the roof is closed like that , you know you 're going to be playing an indoor match , does it change anything in your mind at all ?
is your confidence really high right now coming off of the win last week , coming here , having a very good first match ? describe your confidence level , if you could .
how did it come about that you became the player representative last night to give the speech for li na ? did you volunteer ? did they ask you ?
did you know you would cry during the speech ? li na cried because you cried in your speech .
you could play venus next . obviously that match at wimbledon , one of the best matches of the year . from what you said at wimbledon , it was the match that gave you the confidence to win that title . talk about that matchup and give us a preview .
does it boost your confidence to know you can stick with the no.2 player in the world ?
you won 52 % of halep 's second service points . what made you so successful returning her second serve ?
this year your performance is quite good . you won a lot of matches . you have participated in the china open . what are your feelings ?
can you talk about this match . you are in the top 200. you have played halep . are you surprised with this result ?
in ghangzou you said you are adjusting your serve . as for this match , your first service percentage is not very high .
you said that you want to be in the top 100. what is your plan ?
your answers are quite short and brief . are you talkative or not ?
as a professional tennis player , you should be an extrovert on court .

you 're now 144 in finals in your career . you 're 30 this year . you also sometimes lose fairly early in tournaments . so how do you explain that ? kind of is it just when you get to the end of the tournament you 're full of confidence ? is that just really the difference , do you think ?
you have never lost a set to genie , and she was saying yesterday that when you guys practiced together that you were winning most of the points . so what is it about the matchup against her that seems to suit you ?
congratulations . after she injured her finger , did it throw off your rhythm at all ? because after the injury timeout , you were making a few more errors than you were before and dropped serve when you were serving for the match . i just wondered how that affected you , if at all ?
i have two questions . the first one is we know that according to this big win , do you think that you have already find your optimum state , i mean , just like 2011 , the best year of your career until now ? and the second one is , your opinion , what 's your understanding about the shape and the design of the trophy ?

( through translation . ) you did pretty good on both your forehand and backhand today . so is anything to do with the training with your father and brother ? you did pretty well , both at the forehand ...

can you talk about what happened with the finger in the second set ? how did you hurt it ? did it really affect you the whole second set ?
did you have to take any pace off your shots after it happened , or were you hitting just as hard as you would ?
how much does the leftyness affect the matchup for you ? is it something that actually does affect you in terms of how you respond to it , or is it just , hey , she hits a big ball and it does n't matter whether she 's lefthanded or righthanded , it does n't matter ?
now i 'm one of the genie army . i 'm so nervous when you play and i also keep my fingers crossed . i wish you happy , but i want to say you really play well in the last two games . so i just want to know like will you come back to wuhan next year ? and , like , do you think you play well all the games in wuhan open ?

you have had a couple early losses since wimbledon : cincinnati , us open . do you think you 're starting to find some more consistency in your game ? how does that feel to get this far this week with that ?
( through translation . ) people said that you 're the first and you 're the winner , especially in your forehand , among the wta finals . so my question is : did you take some specific training about your strength , your balance of your body , and your flexibility for your whole body ?
many women players love manicure , and li na said if you come to wuhan she will take you to manicure . have you got your nails done yet in wuhan with li na ? are you superstitious about your color choice before big matches ?
( through translation . ) in the second set you encountered some problems because you took the lead 31 , but then your opponent came back strong and closed again , closed it by 33 , and then she lead by 54. so how did you adjust yourself and finally win the last set ?
( through translation . ) in the highlight of our newspaper today , the title is `` four beauties advancing to the semifinal . '' so tomorrow you may play against eugenie bouchard or caroline wozniacki . so between the two , who do you think is more beautiful ?
when is the last time that you arrived at a tournament believing you could win it ? not maybe , but that you truly believed that from the beginning of the tournament that you could win it .
yeah , like if your form was good or confidence or whatever it was , you arrived and you thought ...
could you talk about possible finals matchups against bouchard and wozniacki . and specifically bouchard , if you play her , do you think she 'll fare a little better or come out a little better than she did at wimbledon ?
is the genie army in town ? how did you get the bear ?
obviously a very good win today . best match you think you 've played since wimbledon ?
can you talk about what you learned from that loss against petra at wimbledon and going into tomorrow what you can do differently , based on that ?
( through translation . ) in the first set you seemed to have got an injury in the foot . will that influence tomorrow 's final ? and kvitova has said that she 's willing to win a title of wuhan open and send it to li na as a gift for retirement . do you have any comments ?
obviously a wimbledon final rematch . the courts seem to be playing pretty quick . that 's what everybody has been kind of saying . i 'm just curious to see if that 's how you feel .
petra said you two actually practiced before the tournament . first question on that is how did that come about ? like who asked who ? was it a full practice or just like a light hit ?
congratulations . talk about that match and how you were able to pull it out . especially the second set it got very , very tight and going into the tiebreak .
what are you more proud of , the fact that you got a win like that over a top10 player or making your first premier semifinal ?
congratulations and welcome to wuhan . since this is your first time here , i want to know , what 's your expectation of your performance before coming here ? and do you have any targets for the wuhan open here ?

what is it about the conditions here in wuhan that seem to be suiting your game ?
when you go to a new tournament , a tournament you have never been to before , are you nervous or are you excited ?
your game style is one that , you know , when you 're playing well it does n't really matter what the other person is doing . so at this point , now that you 've gone through the first few rounds and you are playing well , do you start to think about tactics and things like that with respect to your next opponents , or are you kind of like , you know , if i do what i have to do , it 's not an issue ?
you had a good performance this year . which parts do you improve the most this year , the serve , forehand , or mentally , physically ?
( through translation . ) garcia may be like black horse in this event . what do you think about garcia ? and have you got any understanding of her before the next round ?

( through translation . ) we know that li na and you are close friends , like sisters . now li na has retired , and you have been playing matches in wuhan open during the past several days . have you ever considered like winning a championship and sending it to li na as a gift for retirement ?
you seemed to be cruising in the second set , 52 , and then were you surprised by the level of resistance that you faced after that ?
at 5all in the second set , you came out and you played a pretty incredible return game , breaker at love . what were you telling yourself after kind of squandering that 52 lead that got you to be able to play that sort of return game ?
is nick going to be joining you at any time in asia or europe or are you flying solo ? what 's the story ?
then next up you have n't played either caroline or timea before . how heavily do you rely on scouting reports in that sort of situation , or do you kind of go in on feel ?
( through translation . ) after the match you have also pointed out that you want to win the wuhan open . compared with other seed player just like kerber or wozniacki , what do you think that your advantage is ? and do you have confidence to win them ?
( through translation . ) hello , sweetheart . first i 'd like to congratulate your advance to the quarterfinal . tomorrow you will meet your opponent , timea . what do you think of her performance , and how do you evaluate her ?
at this point you 're kind of winning on a regular basis , easy clip getting into the quarterfinals and stuff . can you compare your mentality now and kind of almost maybe the expectation to win compared to maybe earlier in the season where there may be a few more doubts , i would assume ? but maybe i 'm wrong .
so you have been obviously coming to china and playing in china for quite a few years now , and i 'm wondering , have you noticed any changes whatsoever with respect to kind of how tennis is in china at this point and how it , you know , perceives wta tennis , what the fans are like , those sorts of things ?
i saw you getting to talk to li na when she came onsite for the visit . how is it kind of catching up with her and what did you guys talk about ?
( through translation . ) first i 'd like to extend my congratulations for advance to the quarterfinals . since we all know that you entered the semifinal both in the us open and tokyo , did you have more confidence in advancing to get the semifinal in wuhan open ?
first of all , congratulations . i have two questions . one is that we know that you 're still fighting for qualification for the wta final in singapore . to you , how important the wuhan is ? and the second one is , as close friends , we know that you and serena , i mean , she does the retire from her first match . so what 's your opinion ?
( through translation . ) we all have seen that you have a great determination before the match , that you want to win the match . however , it seems that you have a little problem in approaching the net and serve . so how do you feel about this match ?
were you surprised by how well seemed to be defending ? was that her strength , she was doing it well , or did you feel you were n't getting pace or placement on your shots and it allowed her to do that ?
( through translation . ) we can see that during the match you have asked your coach to give some advices , so we wonder what the advices is for you .
( through translation . ) from the audience today we can see that actually there is a lot of fans in wuhan that love your match . we can all see that you have put your best in this match . after the court , many fans even cried because they are reluctant to let you go . so we wonder , is there anything you want to say to fans in wuhan ? will you come next year ?
results aside , just levelwise , how would you characterize your summer , the hard court season over the last couple of months ?
your clay court season has been better than hard court . how did that happen ?
do you feel like other players are less intimidated by you as a very high ranked , very top player on hard court right now because they think you have more solid results on clay for the last couple of years , so they are free to play their best and they want to beat you like with more determination ?
( through translation . ) during the two matches that you have played in wuhan open , i stand near the coach side , and i always heard that the coach will say that , come on , maria . we wonder whether you have heard these kind of words and did you find encouragement from those words ?
( through translation . ) now three out of four top seeds have n't got through the third round . do you feel there is anything special for you to , it 's hard to get used to in wuhan like the surface , the court , the venue or the player service or something like that ?
( through translation . ) today you played with your compatriot , and you know a lot about each other . you have similar ways of playing . so what do you think is the advantage , and why the victory here ?
this is the first year that wuhan hold this kind of tournament . also , a shining star like you , like maria , like serena , but you know a lot of players , famous players , they do n't need to play 100 % in this tournament because they already have the qualification to the wta final in singapore . but , you know , they have a lot of ambitions to beat big tournaments , so do you think it 's kind of conflict ?
it 's a very long season every year . can be too much for everybody . a lot of players retired from this tournament due to physical problems . just wondering , are you physically okay after two matches ?
also , you mentioned singapore . i 'm sure you will be there . so it 's going to be the first year for the asianpacific region to hold wta finals . so what kind of experience you expect to see and try to get involved ?
( through translation . ) if we set the score as 10 , how would you score your performance today ? is there anything that you can improve ?
( through translation . ) for all the unexpected results the seeds experienced in previous matches , how do you feel about the performance of those seeds ?
( through translation . ) first i 'd like to extend my congratulations for you to advancing to top 10 of wuhan open . so i wonder if you are still confident and you have the confidence to win the championship of the wuhan open .
( through translation . ) after the match you seemed to be very excited . how do you evaluate your performance today ?
( through translation . ) your form is getting better and better . so how did you adjust yourself ? how did you maintain the good momentum ?
you 're talking about how it was just a tennis match no matter what , and i think probably a lot of people in this room do n't know why that is your perspective just coming back and almost retiring and now first top 5 win . can you talk a little bit about that , just the journey from making that decision to come back and now a top 5 .
you have to ask the translator , actually .
( through translation . ) not long ago you had another match with maria , but at that time you lost . so what happened during these several months that made the difference ? what was the difference between the two matches ?
( through translation . ) do you think today 's match maybe like marks a new starting point in your life ? and do you have any plans for your future ?
( through translation . ) in the first set you were a little bit out of form but you adjusted quickly . so i wonder , how did you adjust yourself after the first set ?
( through translation . ) aga and halep were eliminated from their matches , and so how do you feel about these eliminations of these seeds from the match ?
( through translation . ) are you accustomed or used to the court here in wuhan , the matches ? because in some matches some players eliminated and withdrew from the match because of some injury . so how do you get used to the court ?
obviously you 're now a very highranked player , and you won international level tournament this year , but do you think it 's important for you to win big tournaments to try to tell people that you deserve to be here and that you deserve to be no.6 in the world ?
after the us open you also went to visit some fashion shows during fashion week . what kind of experience was that ?
caroline was getting advice from anna wintour to get her hair cut a little bit . did you get any similar advice from her , as well ?

( through translation . ) love and relationship .
you missed the players ' party because of a night session match . what would you wear if you were at the party ? what kind of dress ?
from this week , your competition is now back on track competing for yearend no.1 . it 's either between you , serena , and simona . is that something you put in your mind other than just competing and trying to win the match ?
you seemed to be playing quite well in the first set . just explain what happened in the second and third sets . it was a very hard battle . just explain what happened after that .

( through translation . ) you got some chances in the match , but of course you waste a few opportunities . what do you think the most trouble your opponent make to you during the match ?

anything . the weather and venus williams .
wuhan open , how much do you know wuhan ?
how do you find the speed of the court ? how do you compare it to any other court ? fast , slow ?
normal ?
that was more competitive than the score , was n't it ?
it was a great week for you .
how difficult is it to beat the williams sisters back to back within 24 hours ? you never really had time to enjoy beating serena .
you seemed quite emotional in the first set , like between the games . we could see on the monitor that you looked really emotional . what was going through your mind ?
nevertheless , you must be hugely encouraged by your performance this week , and even in the final tonight you matched venus shot for shot for long periods .
a lot of players love this tournament . what have you enjoyed about it ?
you have played two of the strongest players of this era . do you think players like you , your age , you think you are there to have the limelight in the next few years ?
how tough was that out there with the ball coming at you like rockets ?
is there anything else you could have done ?
closer than the score indicates . did you feel that way ?
looking at the week as a whole , you still made the semis . are you happy with where your game is at ? and what kind of things do you want to work on ?
how does it feel to beat the top player in the world ?
how difficult was it to close the match out against such a great player ?
did think you would win in two groups ?
two sets .
you looked right from the start as if you believed you could win . you looked very confident and positive .
you made semis in paris . now a final here . have you been doing anything differently ?
there was a screaming contest there , the second set ?
thoughts on venus williams ?
a lot of players can have a problem with such a big win coming back the next day .
how do you think you 're going to combat that ?
does it please you she was here . she was impressed with your performance tonight .
serena .
does it please you ?
a lot of players have a big win and have trouble following it up . how are you going to avoid having a letdown after this ?
it does n't get a lot better than that , does it ?
the way you played her today you lost to her two or three times . you have had tough matches against her . why was it so different this time ?
you spent a lot of time here obviously the past month or going back to the new year . how big of an advantage is it to know this is kind of like a home tournament and you have won here in the past ?
what do you like about dubai and this tournament ?
and your thoughts against venus ?
i think the last time you played each other was 2008 , so a lot has changed since then . how do you think you have improved since then ?
is he going to give you extra advice for tomorrow ?
can you remember watching them at home when you were a kid ?
the beads ?
just in terms of power or in any other things ?
are they part of the crowd , or are they a little bit separate ?
to win the tournament , you might have to go through venus and then serena . does that excite you , that sort of challenge , being put up against two modernday greats like that ?
how close would you say you are to winning a grand slam in the scheme of things ? i know you dropped out in the third round in australia . do you think that was n't a fair reflection of where your game is at the moment ?
if you would just like to give us your reaction to the result today . obviously very disappointing .
was the turnaround difficult ? obviously playing in the evening , going into the afternoon in a short space of time .
just a reflection on your tournament . obviously you beat errani , a seeded player . you played very well yesterday . how do you think your game is generally ?
you 're in a good place for the hard court season in america , a nice buildup block to move on ?
what do you like about this tournament ?
that was n't easy , was it ?
were the conditions difficult out there ?
do you feel that having had two tough matches gives you a bit of momentum somehow for the tournament ?
you enjoy that ?
i understand you changed your racquet brand at the start of the year from yonex to babolat . what was the thinking behind that ? how different a racquet do you have now with babolat than you did with yonex , would you say ? it 's a technical question , but ...
have the dimensions of the racquet changed ? have you changed like to a different strength or size of it ? is it longer ? like federer , for example , has a big racquet . is it in any way different to the yonex one ?
did you consult rory about it ? obviously he changed his ...
you mentioned yesterday how happy you are off the court . you could tell that yesterday . how does that translate and how important is it for you playing on the court ?
there were some unfortunate stories and rumors that went around a few weeks ago about you and rory . did that in any way affect your relationship with the media ? does n't seem to have done . you have always been more open than most players about the relationship and we appreciate that . but did that experience damage the relationship in any way ?
the rumors that you split up .
are you able to dismiss that kind of thing quite easily or does it hurt ?
ana said you 're playing pretty much as well as you ever have done in your career . what do you feel about that ?
how do you feel you 're playing ?
why smarter ? i mean , you 've always been a smarter player . where did your mind go ? took a vacation ?
you 're serving very consistently , and you came to the net quite a lot .
obviously every match is different , but this is very , very different from your match last month against her .
is there no longer an issue in backing up matches ? if you get a good win , you 're able to do it again the following day ?
are you feeling healthwise better or have you learned how to deal with making yourself feel better under the circumstances ?
presumably you have to try and preserve energy a little . why are you playing doubles ? why did you play doubles this week ?
is that the danger in making those decisions ? you do n't know how it 's going to really play out ?
can you just say what you learned from the match in auckland against ana ? you said you learned a lot .
do you nevertheless feel that your emotions , your sense of optimism , is quite a lot greater now than it was at that time back in january ?
do you sense a lot of people want you to get back ?
you guys have to expect that you 're going to play nights in premier spots , matches . ca n't be a surprise though , right ? you know people come out to see serena and venus .
what went wrong after the four games to one ?
are the conditions different to when you won here a couple of years ago ?
was the heat a bit of a problem ? it 's very hot out there today .
how difficult is it as a seeded player to come in cold against a good player like flavia who has had to come through qualifying and play four matches ? was that sort of the difference , that she 's used to the surroundings and you are maybe not so much ?
an eventful day . if we can start off with your singles opponent , knocking out radwanska , how do you feel about that ?
how much would you say that the fact that you have to qualify and you played four games whereas aga is coming in cold as a seeded player , did that help that you 're climatized to the conditions ?
when you have a long losing streak against someone , i mean , did you do anything differently today or do you go out uninhibited ?
radwanska mentioned the conditions out there . what did you make of the conditions ? she was saying it was blustery ?
venus next ?
your thoughts on that ? she dismissed ana ivanovic .
just a few words on your doubles today . obviously with sam , winning that .
is this potentially a longterm partnership with sam ?
what are your thoughts on that ?
is there extra pressure in trying to defend a title ?
is it a little bit sort of slower and cooler playing late at night ?
you spent quite a lot of time out there . so are you physically feeling well ? because that was one of the things you wanted to ...
physically you 're feeling fine ?
congratulations . can you just talk about the match .
you get to play serena now .
how confident are you heading into this match ? and it 's going to be on center court . you played your first two matches ...
your match with her the end of last year was a very close one .
how do you feel your game is shaping up after the first two rounds ?
must be nice to be drawn against serena , because presumably you 'll be playing in the evening .
you 're someone who had a lot of early success and did well and then had a little bit of an inbetween patch . when you look at somebody like sloane stephens who last year , you know , was a semifinalist at the australian and now genie bouchard this year was a semifinalist , inevitably it does n't stay on that high and they kind of have this kind of thing ( indicating up and down ) , what kind of advice would you offer them from your experiences ?
so do you ladies sit in the locker room giving each other tips on the newcomers ?
did you watch serena 's match last night , or were you at the player party ?
i do n't suppose you especially need to watch her match to know where you 're going to face her ?
can you just talk about the match ? what do you think was n't working for you today ?
how much did last night 's match take out of you mentally ? is it difficult to go through such a mentally tough match and then ...
how difficult is it to play someone who hits the ball so hard ?
when you 've got backtoback matches , as you have done , how difficult is it to , having won such a good match yesterday , and then refocus against such a big player today ?
did you sense much difference between her today and the match you guys had in the beginning of the year ?
how close to the venus of old would you say this venus is ? how close do you think she is ?
you mentioned yesterday that one of the things you really want to work on is to be able to follow up a big win like yesterday with more . so in the bigger sense of everything , is this a big disappointment ?
you said yesterday that serbs are combative personalities and you yourself are quite emotional on the court . i mean , do you get too angry with yourself when things are n't going right , or contrastingly are you too nice a person ?
you had to fight pretty hard to come back for that , did n't you ?
it was important to win a match like that , was n't it ?
do you notice any of the martina hingis influence in her play ? has it changed at all ?
you had to do lots of different things to turn that around . would you have been able to do that three , four years ago ?
yes , in that way .
staring down the barrel of last year 's wimbledon runnerup , to be able to come out to dominate the remaining two sets as you did must give you a lot of confidence for your next match , which will either be stosur or beck .
what is it that makes you so mentally tough in every match ?
i have got two daughters , and if i kept coming right up to them and telling them what to do , i know what the answer would be . were you a really wellbehaved child ?
i 'm just asking , because i know what would happen if i kept telling my daughters serving for a match ...
have you been anywhere cold this year ?
sometime you 're going to have to face the challenge of getting gloves on over your huge ring .
you faced the challenge ?
do you play with that on ?
can you tell us how many carats , or you do n't want to ?
when your dad comes onto the court , does he reassert stuff which you feel you already know , or does he tell you new things which you can take on board ?
do you have wedding plans ? you do n't have to tell us what they are , but ...
can you give us an idea of when ? you do n't have to give us a date . this year ?
might be good to get married just after wimbledon .
are you able to compare where your game is at now as opposed to when you lifted the trophy here three years ago ?
are you a better golfer or is rory a better tennis player ?
must be very disappointing to be so close to winning that match .
you played a good match , though . you must be pleased with that .
is it difficult , having played in the doha final sunday , and 48 hours later you are playing a really good player ? normally these early matches are a little bit easier . is that difficult to adjust ?
you played a good match against a very good player . was there anything you could have done differently , do you think ?
what are your targets for this year ?
is there anything about being a top player that surprised you over the last year or so ?
do you feel you should get more recognition for being a top player ? you 're very kind of low profile .
german players in the last few years , i guess , have perhaps had to operate with expectations based on past great players . women players and men players have been compared with graf and becker and so on . has that in any way affected you in the kind of profile that you 're getting ?
do you know if the german public has forgotten the past and is now trying to look to the future more ?
why do you think there was kind of a lull after steffi , anke , and for 10 years there was nobody and suddenly there are five or six very , very good german players .
do you the get the feeling perhaps you 're even stronger than the last group ? apart from steffi and anke there was porwik , singer , bunge , pfaff , plenty of players . do you think you 're actually a stronger group now ?
you had to work hard for that , did n't you ?
you are one of the few world no.1s we have here this week . how far do you think you are from reaching your top level ?
you have been coming here probably more years than you care to think about . what do you like about dubai ?
how much time do you actually are you like roger ? you use this as your training base ?
is it a long way away from here ? because i saw you in the hotel this morning .
your place .
sorry , i thought you have a residence .
but you used to have ...
given that you do have a special affinity with dubai , obviously there 's a lot of water to go under the bridge , but what would it mean if you were to able to lift the trophy here on saturday night ?
on to more pressing matters , i think you have lucie safarova next up . how do you see that matchup ?
it was very close .
how did you manage to get through that ?
why was it so close ?
how difficult is it to close out a match like that mentally ?
you get to play venus next . you played her earlier in the year . can you talk about that ? it does n't get that much easier for you .
the way you have been playing this year , you must think the sky 's the limit . you 're really going to get back to the top again .
is it difficult to focus on one match to the next and keep the same intensity ?
how much confidence did you get from the match against serena in the australian open when you were in a tight thirdset sort of scenario against a competitive player ? does an experience like that help when you 're in a match like tonight ?
( indiscernible . )
your serbian team , support team , how important are they to your newfound approach this year , would you say ?
how bad is the ankle ?
so this was not the achilles ?
so it was not the ankle ?
you did well to get through then last week , given the way it is today ?
were you afraid you might have to stop last week ?
did you at any point feel like maybe i should n't even come to dubai after last week ?
what exactly troubles you most in the matches with your achilles ? what was the pain exactly ?
so is the aim just to have a bit of rest and still play in a couple of weeks , or do you feel like perhaps you might need a bit longer off the court to recover properly ?
do you welcome the rest that you 're going to have ? you 've played a lot of matches .
can you still train with the injury ?
can you do other things ?
it 's inflammation ?
you have had such a great start to the year . do you feel this could perhaps derail your season the rest of this year in terms of slams , etcetera ?
but are you fearful at all this achilles will be a niggling injury that will stay with you till perhaps the end of the year to perhaps hinder those goals ?
do you plan on playing serbia in fed cup ?
what surface will it be ?
what do you like ?
the way you talked about the rollercoaster ride this year , sydney first round and then australian open , then first round in paris , do you hope to change that in the coming days ?
what do you think about serbian team ?
ana and jovanovski .
i 'm guessing .
good win today , was n't it , against someone you have n't got a good record against ?
what were you pleased most with ?
is it also encouraging both to beat someone you have not beaten before but also to get the matches that you need ?
do you feel if you get the matches that a lot of other things are in place , adequate fitness and your game is still there ? do you feel it 's just the matches you need now ?
at this sort of slightly unusual stage of your career , is there more enjoyment from being out there in the sense that you realize that it wo n't always be there ?
what do you expect of yourself ?
why is it easier said than done ?
coming back to where you have done well before and won the tournament , what does that do for you ? you have done it in lots of places , but ...
and you plan to come irrespective of what serena does , whether she decided to come or not ?
would you have played qualifying ?
have you spoken with alisa ?
about your experiences ?
how is the wrist doing ?
like what percentage better , would you say , 100 % , 80 , 60 ?
you have n't had that much success coming to doha and dubai . can you just talk about why do you think that is ? is it jet lag ? is it just playing somewhere very different than where you spend most of the year ?
can you talk about the match today ? it looked in the second set that i think you broke her toward the end . just talk about mentally how it was for you and what made the difference in the end .
what went into the choice of paul ? is he here with you ?
are you still working with him ?
what made you go on to him ? what do you think he could offer you ?
to this point , what 's been the better tips he has given you ? not necessarily of your game but just in general .
is there a little part of you that wished that maybe last year , not that you did n't do as well as you did , but did n't make such a splash , that you could have gone under the radar a little more ?
no , at the beginning , your whole last year with the australian open semis and everything , maybe not making such a splash in like the news and everything , more under the radar ?
what do you feel you learned ?
how do you compare your mindset now to a year ago when there was this huge media attention and everything after australia , and now that you 've been consistently doing well in grand slams , do you feel that mentally you 're stronger and different now compared to a year ago ?
genie is following a similar path that you did last year here . has she talked to you at all about it or anything ?
there are n't that many players in the top that are as young as you are , so do you feel this generation gap makes you a bit detached than everyone around you , or is it lonely at all on the tour for you ?
without paul here , and you said everybody sticks to themselves a bit , so after a day like today , how would you just make yourself feel better or put the things into perspective ?
what 's next ? indian wells ?
would you stick around here for a day or two to hit with players , or are you leaving right away ?
you repeated the title in stuttgart , but madrid was like a new place to win .
simona was very complementary on the way you played . for me it was much more important to see how relieved you were at the end . even though you almost achieved everything in your life , it was very important for you to win this tournament , and not only this tournament but so many others . what is this love that you have for tennis ?
we also saw you giving nice words to dinara safina . let 's saw health is the most important thing .
i just want to know about your relation with sven , who seems to be a very competitive person as well .
do you think this relation will last many more years as it can be ?
do you measure the success of cooperation with them ...
... on your titles , or how do you measure that ?
how are you going to celebrate tonight ?
we saw some of your matches with not so many people . we know the tickets are sold , but what would you say to madrid 's public ? only nadal , or it 's okay in any case ?
is it special for to you win a title on clay ?
after winning two titles , will you try to change the preparations before roland garros ? will you try to play as much as you can in rome ?
sometimes it 's hard to see you smile , but in madrid you are happy . you are having in a good time in general apart from winning ?
congratulations anyway for being in the finals . did you have time to analyze what happened ? do you have any regrets or are you happy with your week anyway ?
what do you think was the difference ?
congratulations for the tournament . your relation with virginia ruzici , it 's still there ?
after today 's match do you feel like it 's a learning experience to understand how to compete with fellow top players , and most importantly , how to manage to win those kind of matches on big occasions ?
do you ave any expectations for roland garros or match by match or what ?
congratulations on your great tournament . after winning the first set , did you get nervous , or was it just the game of maria that made the comeback ?
i understand the season still has a long way to go , but what is more important for you : to try to win your first grand slam or try to qualify for the yearend championships in singapore ?
first of all , congratulations for your win . i want to ask you , you started very impressive today . you e went up 61 , 30 very quickly and then lost four games in a row . you called your coach and then things turned around .
won the last two games of the match . what happened there ? what did he say ? how are you feeling at that moment ? what did you change ?
you had the same tactics i think against her in stuttgart . you cut down her angles and stopped her from playing her game . what plans have you got for halep ? she 's a whole different ballgame .
what do you think about halep , your rival , her game ?
you won your first title of the year in stuttgart a couple weeks ago . you been playing really well on the clay court in the last few years . can we say that you 're feeling as good on clay as on hard court ?
congratulations .
today simona was running after every ball and she was playing two hours and a half ; yesterday you had a long match as well and today you played . i want to ask you how you feel physically , because we see that in madrid it 's very hot ? how do you feel ? what you expect from tomorrow 's match ?
she run after every , every ball .
i would like to ask you about love . you are in relationship with grigor dimitrov one year and a half almost . how is possible to keep ...
congratulations for that . i 'm from bulgaria , and i 'm very happy because i think you both are a great couple .
but you never replied . so my question is : does love help to professional careers ?
very , very well done . great comeback by you . tell us a little bit about how you 're feeling about the final tomorrow .
congratulations again . which were your expectations when you came here ?
you told us in stuttgart you are not ready to win a grand slam . are you changing your mind ?
have you had a chance to watch the match going on now ? do you watch before your next match to see your opponents and see how they play ?
you have been working with new coach after australian open . just wanted to know how is the relation with him and how is the cooperation between you two ?
i think you mentioned in indian wells that serve is something you would like to work on with the new coach . after two months from that time , do you think that your serve is improving right now , especially on the clay courts with these matches you have played ?
congratulations on the win .
it was a tough match . just wondering , which are those big events in your life that provided you with that mental toughness to go through those matches ?
you play with li na a couple times on clay . why do you think you have this mental edge against her on those few occasions ? you were down in the points and she was leading ; she seemed to almost have this match , but you fought back and won .
you said you did n't play so well in the first set . do you think the way you came back , particularly in the third set and your form in recent weeks and your form in stuttgart , that you 're approaching your best form ?
on a wider aspect , are you in favor of oncourt coaching ? do you think for you particularly that it works ?
you may play against caroline garcia . can you tell a little bit on her ?
max a trying to organize a few exhibition matches between you and li na in china after the singapore championships . what are your thoughts about this idea ? do you think it 's a good thing for the chinese fans to experience , to see two great players playing tennis in front of them ?
do you have some doubt about your flight to rome ? you 're okay with your leg ? everything is okay ?
congratulations .
can you make an evaluation of the match and of the spanish player , the best spanish player ?
serena , do you consider clay is now your new favorite court to play considering you always have these very comfortable wins with such good performances ? all the time .
you played with a spanish player , so did you feel good with spanish public in the stadium ?
you played today against a player expert on clay , but you were impressive , especially in the last few games match . how did you see your level today ?
congratulations .
how do you face the next one for the quarters ?
i think we do n't know yet .
bouchard , kuznetsova , and vinci and you 're in the quarterfinals . it 's one of the toughest draws you have ever played ?
yeah .
how do it feel to play in that court outside ? there was some noise . do you prefer to play there or in manolo santana ?
do you prefer to avoid any contender on your way to the final or it does n't matter who you face ?
do you think you 're more confident now after yesterday 's win against kuznetsova ?
congratulations on your win .
it was a very strong win , and you were playing very well here and in stuttgart . how do you rate your chances for here , rome , and more importantly , roland garros ?
you 've been working on your consistency . you 've been very consistent all through the tournament . it 's been seven years since you made the roland garros final , and six since you won it . how do you see how you 've matured in those years ?
the game that you have , do you think it 's possible that you can beat serena ? sharapova can not . you could do it hitting hard ?
you were talking about the quality of the women 's players now . which are those qualities that a tennis player should have to play on clay ?
can you tell what did you do to get the frustration out of you after losing to sharapova in stuttgart and come back strong here in madrid ? rest or traveling or having dinner with family ? something ?
you played very well today . do you think it 's time to win in madrid ?
you feel people in madrid love you ?
also , would you share some thoughts about the retirement of dinara safina , whom you beat in the final of roland garros six years ago .
good result today . how is your leg looking , feeling ?
is that because the conditions are a bit cooler today , a bit craggy ?
how are you feeling sort of about your chances going forward ? you 're playing very well at the moment .
do you think the match was as easy as the score shows ? how do you think your opponent played today ?
strange to have two days off in a nonslam event ? how does that help your preparation ?
the fact that you did n't win the first grand slam of the year , is it going to affect the way you prepare for the second slam , which is french open ?
congratulations .
it was really a difficult match with kuznetsova , a thriller , really .
shoulder watch . looks okay . no strapping . it was quite a heavy day . how are you feeling in yourself now ?
congratulations for your winning .
i would like to know if your back hurt you . i noticed you were holding your back after every hit .
svetlana is one of those players that has historically dominated you . what 's the feeling after this victory ?
you 're going to face roberta vinci next . what do you expect from this match ?
you have saved three match points today . in any moment you thought you were out of the tournament ?
after a quick exit in stuttgart , you 're playing very well here . tell us about today 's match .
she played very well in the second set . she picked up her game . did you have to adjust your game plan today ?
and you might face your countrywoman begu or lisicki next . thoughts about either ?
madrid last year was the turning point of the year and of your career . what changed ? because after this tournament started getting amazing results .
i want to ask you why is madrid so special to you . we have been seeing your personal blog and you look really comfortable here .
talk about the second set .
you beat christina mchale here last year in the second round . did you expect a match so complicated this time ?
the work with sven is bringing you new things ? you feel more secure ? the objective is to beat serena or just to be better by yourself ?
in what way is it helpful for you to be able to have the coach on your side during the match compared to the times where that was n't so ? does it really help you ?
well , the coaches were n't always allowed to come and see you .
yes .
yesterday we saw all the tennis family out there on the court . did you know elena ?
you are playing sam or garbine next . obviously you have played sam a lot , and also you played garbine i believe in rome last year .
what do you expect from both ?
congratulations on a good week . can you talk about the match and how you feel what was working for you and what was n't working for you today .
what kind of difficulties does a player face when they 're playing someone like simona who there is a lot of variation in her game ? can you talk about that ?
she plays very fast . does that make it tougher that she seems to always be rushing her opponents ?
you had a great week here . you are the only one who did n't lose a set . you 're going to dubai . are you feeling confident ?
we did n't get a chance to talk about it yesterday , but you played almost like the best point of the whole tournament . did you get to watch it again ?
speaking of dubai , we mentioned this before , but now that this tournament is over , you get to play ana . can you talk about that , and is it a bit weird to face someone ranked so high in the first round ?
did you expect first to finish this stage of doha tournament ? my second question is since steffi graf , there is no german highcaliber tennis for ladies . are you working towards that end ?
did you expect to be in the final of this tournament before coming here ?
if you could just talk about the game , how did you leave it inside the central court , and what happened ?
can you say that you came back in the second set ? you were fighting ? you were aggressive ?
you had a little bit of success when you came to the net a couple of times . did you think about doing that , or was there anything else you could have done differently ?
what 's your sort of emotional reaction to that ? do you feel disappointed or do you feel that when an opponent plays as well as that it 's inevitable ? how good do you think she is ?
would you go away and think about playing her differently next time ? is that something you 'll do ?
well done , angelique . that match completely changed character in the second set , did n't it ? was that a bit difficult or disconcerting when she came back at you that way ?
were you playing better than you played in brisbane ?
you were playing aggressively in the important moments ?
can you comment on that last point at the net cord ?
did you speak to her about that ?
you put on such a strong performance tonight . how do you feel about your game going into the finals tomorrow ?
i know you were training in qatar in the offseason . why did you decide to spend your offseason here in qatar ?
going back to the match , in the sixth and seventh game , 3all and 43 , it seemed like very crucial games and you saved breakpoints and went back and there were so many deuces . can you just talk about what 's going through your mind to manage to come out of these two games and just keep fighting ?
you 're into a final here , but already the draw is out for dubai . did you look at the draw ? do you know who you 're playing ? can you just talk about that ? you have a very tough first round . also , is it difficult to stay focused in this tournament when you already know who you 're going to play in the first round next week ?
raul , the football player , was watching your match . i 'm wondering if you ever met him .
could you talk a little bit about the way you will play tomorrow , if it 's either against radwanska or halep ?
you have already played so many matches this season and we 're barely in the middle of february . just how fresh are you feeling ? do you think this is going to catch up with you at some point soon , or you 're feeling good ?
is that what makes it a little difficult when you plan a schedule , because you do n't know you 're going to go so deep every week ? and i guess , in a way , that 's a new thing for you ?
congratulations . you 're one step closer to your first title here . you played very aggressive tonight . will you play the same way tomorrow ?
we saw your coach taking down notes yesterday during the quarterfinals . did that come down to that ? he was taking notes from radwanska 's match . did it come down to that ? did that help ?
you play kerber tomorrow . can you talk about this matchup and what you maybe would do differently or how you 're approaching it ?
you 're obviously a top10 player and everything , but we tend to always think about serena or something like that . do you kind of like being a top10 player but not somebody who gets like all the publicity and attention ? or would you like more attention ?
how is the achilles ?
how do you think your standard is now compared with your standard when you finished last year ? it looks higher . do you feel that ?
when you played finals before , did it feel different from any other match , or were you able to keep it with your mind focused ?
can you talk a little bit about next week , playing in dubai ? the draw is already out .
i heard you asking the crowd to come back . so did the crowd help you ? does it feel like playing home ? because many people were cheering there for you .
if we take the four semifinalists from the australian open , you are the one , the only one which reach semifinal here . is there maybe an explanation ?
cibulkova was eliminated in the first round . bouchard was eliminated in the first round . li na was defeated . and you are the fourth semifinalist .
until now you had an easy tournament . you have won easily your game . is it a problem before the semifinals or not ?
can you just look at your semifinal matchup and talk about her ?
your intensity did n't seem to be as high as it was in the last two matches . did the long matches in the last two rounds take their toll on you a little bit ?
physically were you struggling from anything or just fatigue ?
how does a big champion like you come back from a loss like you had today or the one that you had in australia ? how do you digest it ? how do you come back from it ?
before coming here you were sick , and now you had three good matches . are you going to dubai feeling that you have had enough matches and enough confidence going there ?
on a slightly happier note , today is valentine 's day . do you celebrate this day , or is it of any significance to you ?
well played . sometimes you can play well and get to the later stages of the tournament but be too tired to do yourself justice , say , in a final . so winning a match like this so quickly , is it doubly helpful ?
do you feel good because your preparation is good , or do the conditions , which were a little slow perhaps , help you or what is it ?
in this match when you got on top , was focus important to keep , stay on top and not let her have a chance ?
you play petra or jelena next . can you talk about each match separately since they are playing right now ?
does it worry you a little bit that you were n't really tested in the past three matches because you spent very little time on court ? after a match like today , will you go maybe and practice some more maybe ?
do you start the year with specific goals in mind of what you want or you just play it by ear ? if you do start it , what were your plans for this year or hopes ?
can we speak about the surprise ?
i mean your win today , this afternoon . can we speak about the surprise ?
congratulations . can you talk a little bit about the game and how do you feel right now ?
did it perhaps go a bit faster than you expected going into the match ?
and the last game , she kind of came up with shots that she was n't able to do throughout the whole two sets , right ?
can you talk about the semifinal against angelique . you have never been to the final here . how do you feel about your chances , and how do you feel about that matchup ?
i wanted to ask you a question about being coached by your brother . what are the advantages and disadvantages of being coached by your brother ?
you said a few words to the camera . i think it was for your mother ?
congratulations . that seemed like a very strong win for you . how did you feel about your performance ?
can we say that you took your revenge from her ?
can you talk a bit about the game of tomorrow ?
can you talk a little bit about the injury and where you feel it 's at or how much it 's injuring you ?
you turned that match around quite well from what looked like a difficult position in the second set , and then at the end it slipped away . did you get tired , or what happened ?
there is still a bit of wind . does that make it difficult for a player of your style ?
were you pleased with your game when you were i think 2all or something in the second set , you took seven games in a row and took charge of the match . were you pleased with that phase of the match and why did it not continue ?
you will use that information ?
you had a 31 lead in that third set . was it something she did , or was it something you did n't do that you were n't able to hold on and win the match ?
you have played her before . she had to qualify to get in here . today she looked pretty confident and secure . any thoughts on why she 's like only 133 in the world and had to qualify on her game ? any thoughts about her ?
if you had to change something in the way you played yesterday and today , what did you learn from this week here in doha ? what would you change ?
took you until the third set to really break away from her . talk a little bit about the match .
did you feel you served well ? i think you had like 15 aces .
just talk a little bit about your quarterfinal .
quite a match . i think she had a 31 lead in the third set and you came back . you just really kept after her . talk about how you feel .
was it something you did or something that she did or a combination ?
i believe it 's only the second time you have ever beaten a top 3 player . radwanska was the other one . she 's the reigning australian open champion . that must give you a lot of confidence for where you are at the beginning of the season .
congratulations for this wonderful win . how do you feel after this big surprise of beating li na , no.2 in the world , and qualifying to the next round ?
how do you keep yourself calm ? because it 's a great win , but then there is tomorrow . you have to come back and play . a lot of players , after a big win , have trouble keeping themselves calm and in the moment .
did you feel that li na tired during that match ?
yesterday li na had difficulties to win her first game . for you it was very possible today to win ?
talk a little bit about that third set , kind of a tough one . you had three opportunities to be 51. how did it kind of get away ?
it 's been a while since you have come to play in the middle east . i just wanted to know what was your thought behind coming here and dubai , also . you have n't been there since you won it . just talk about that , please .
do you feel fit now , venus ?
if you keep getting in the right positions and get the luck that you need with health and other things , what can you still do ?
do you still enjoy it , or are you doing it for other reasons ?
it was a strange game at the beginning where you were flying , and after it was very difficult . can you explain that ?
how did it feel to get back out there ? it 's been a while .
how have you been celebrating your australian open win ?
well done . it must have been difficult also because of the wind . did you decide not to compromise and just play your way even though it was windy ?
you have always been a positive player , but you started very aggressively and played a lot of the match very aggressively . is this a new emphasis as your career progresses to be that way ?
having had the success you have had , does that make you more calm , as well ?
i do n't know if you heard about the national sports day yesterday here in qatar . how do you see the fact that one country reserve all one day to push people and to encourage them to practice sport ?
can you talk a little bit about winning australia ? do you think that it makes it more important for you and your legacy that you now have two slams as opposed to just one ?
i heard that your autobiography is out in english now . so can you tell us , have you heard any feedback from englishspeaking people ? what can people look forward to read ? which parts of your life are you revealing in the autobiography ?
a couple of bignamed players pulled out just before the tournament , including azarenka and serena . does that change how you approach a tournament , how you think , how you play , how you approach each match in the tournament ?
there is a lot of players we see their mothers or fathers come around . has your mother ever gone to watch you play in any of these events ?
she just does n't want to or scared to watch ?
not interested ?
petra , you faced three break points that would have given her a 51 lead in the third set . how did you climb back into it ?
you two have played before . since she 's been sick and stuff like that , how much better was she tonight than in previous , more recent matches ?
congratulations . obviously it 's not the way anyone wants to win a match , but you must be pleased to get your first singles victory of the year .
can you tell us a little about how you feel physically at the moment ? do you feel your body is at its best , the best it 's ever been ? is it over the treatment and stuff that you received about a year ago ?
gamewise , can you tell us where you are , how far you are from , you know , the top20 player that you were before you stopped ?
well , it was an abbreviated evening . talk about how you felt you were playing for as much as you got to play .
like you said , most of the players came from fed cup , and this is a tournament that 's fairly off the beaten path , you know , not next door . how tough is that commute and stuff ?
like you talked on the court , you 're having a great start to the year . are you feeling this momentum coming into this tournament ? how do you feel ?
talk a little bit more about that confidence . is it in the coach , or are you feeling more settled in yourself or less nervous ?
to go back to the match , was it hard to play with these weather conditions , like cold , the wind ?
welcome back . you must have been pleased with most of the things that you did in difficult conditions today .
you served pretty well and you hit the ball pretty well . what else pleased you about the performance ?
i also like the outfit . is that your design ?
the name ?
fiore . when you come back to somewhere where you have done well , you won wta championships here , i think , does that help ? is that in your head when you come ?
could i ask you a mandela legacy question ? i know serena was considering applying the truth and reconciliation idea to your terrible experience in indian wells . do you have any sort of thoughts or feelings about that that you could share about whether it 's ever likely that you 'd go back and whether you 'd apply his legacy to that ?
would you think about it at any time , do you think ?
where do you find the motivation to go on and go on ?
is serena an inspiration for you ? because she came back after illness .
if you could talk about the game ?
was it easy to play in the weather conditions with the wind and a bit chilly ?
coming out of qualifying , how much did that help with your preparation for today ? familiar with the surface , getting used to the conditions leading into today 's match ?
getting used to playing out of qualifying obviously did well earlier this year in sydney .
how much has that helped with your confidence for the rest of the year ?
obviously you 've played through qualifying for a few tournaments . with that comes an improved ranking . are you looking forward to not having to play qualifying for events upcoming ?
you served really well in the first set . in the second set you took a lot of pace off the first serve . was that a conscious decision to put more first serves in ?
what do you think made the difference today ?
how did it feel today going into the match physically ?
are you saying you 're tired because of the illness ?
considering how well you 've done this week , you 're back in the top 20 , have you set yourself some goals between now and the end of the season ?
what did you enjoy the most during this amazing week in montral ?
why did you wait so long ?
is it possible that you might be back later on this year to play in qubec ?
you talked earlier this week about enjoying the time you have , a new philosophy for enjoying the game . based on the success you 're having , does that philosophy shift to becoming more competitive , not so much the enjoyment of the game , but the enjoyment of the results ?
prize money has come up a few times . stacey allaster talked about the difference in prize money between the men and women in canada . you 're somebody who has lobbied for that in the past . what do you think should be done in bringing about total equality in prize money ?
it is . in general , what do you think can be done to bring about that kind of equality ?
first win over serena in over five years . how does it feel ?
serena said she felt you were serving better today in spite of all those aces . did you feel that ?
you said on the court that it felt like the final today . how do you get as excited for tomorrow 's match ?
how has the emotional charge from playing serena changed from match 1 through 25 ?
you 've spent a lot of time on court over the last three days . do you feel it at all right now ?
what about the dancing ? are you going to go again tonight ?
last year after repeated victories novak djokovic entertained the crowd by doing a crazy victory dance . is there a particular song you would groove to ?
what would it mean to you to win this tournament ?
how much more do you appreciate playing serena now that the frequency is n't how it used to be ?
how big of a deal is it for you to knock off the world 's no.1 player ?
your level of play has been consistently high lately . almost like you 've gone into a time machine a little bit . i 'm wondering if that 's because you almost had to reset , and have you learned to put it together in a new way , manage the illness , manage the time ? is this a result of relearning with a new factor to how to be a professional tennis player ?
nobody knows serena 's game better than you do . how far do you think she is from getting to her top level again ?
did you just play the match of your life then ?
i 'm ignorant about your illness . how do you feel better ? sometimes you feel better , sometimes you do n't ? do you have to manage it with some sort of pharmaceuticals ?
hopefully nothing illegal .
the regimen , is that drugs you 're managing it with ?
do you feel more pressure to win tournaments when you knock your sister out ?
you only played serena once in the past five years . did you think at all today it could be your last one ?
do you have any preferences for who you play of your two possible opponents tomorrow ?
does it lessen the sting at all to lose to your sister ?
huge number of aces , but some doublefaults . was the strategy all in for the power on that first serve ? is that why those numbers reflect that ?
at times you seemed frustrated with your play , your backstroke . was it troublesome today , your mechanics ?
can you talk a bit about your comeback in the first set . seemed like you dug deep . you were down 31 .
did you actually hang out with your sister last night ?
if you analyze the game , what do you think she was doing better than you today ?
you 've been saying all week how proud you are of your sister . she had tough matches all week long and showed mental strength . how do you feel about that ?
were you happy with what you worked on this week , today aside , the state of your game , where you 're trying to get it to ?
you played a great game . after a match like that , do you look at the stats and work it out with your coach and look at the doublefaults , the number of aces , adjust your strategy for the next game ?
you 've had a singles grand slam win in nine of the last 12 years . how important is it for you to make this 10 in 13 ?
venus moves back into the top 20 now . how high can she climb again , do you think ?
we 've seen you have some pretty big comebacks in your career against a lot of players . if it 's your sister on the other side of the net , is it difficult to get it up to that level of intensity ?
you were saying you were just looking forward to next year . there 's a little tournament in new york in a couple weeks . are you overlooking the us open or just figuring that you have to lower your standards to get through the rest of the year ?
you only played once in the past five years . sometimes you say this could be the last time . did you think about this at all today ?
against venus .
the crowd from montral was very happy to see you again after 14 years . what were your feelings about that ? can we hope to see you again two years from now ?
what made the difference today ?
it was a very tight match . what do you think was the difference in the end ?
is it frustrating to play against a player like her who has an answer to every shot you throw at her ?
how satisfied are you with your week overall despite the loss today ?
you came out in the first set , served well , your backhand was on fire , then the match got closer . small margins decided that match . what made the difference out there ?
as one of the young stars on the circuit , how do you view serena when you go to play her ? not only is she an older player , older star , but she 's been having an inconsistent year , especially at the bigger tournaments . which serena do you think will be there when you play her ?
you were young when serena and venus started to play . you 're 10 years younger than them . how do you think they 've changed tennis over the years , the style of play , the scheduling , the impact they had ?
i 'm not sure how much time you spend with serena off the court . how do you think she deals with the ups and downs of her tennis as a person ?
you 're her friend . you might know .
in the second set did you feel a bit the nerves ? was that a reason or not ?
it 's a tough life that you live , traveling , playing at that level . what do you do with your downtime ?
any other sports ?
today was not such an easy match . how did you manage to pull it through ?
not an easy match . it was a difficult match .
did you notice she was getting tired and played accordingly ?
yes .
what are you most happy about this whole week ?
what is it about your game that you 're happy about ? what is working well for you this week that you find is making the difference ?
you played well today , have a great allaround game . what is your favorite surface ?
your favorite surface .
tomorrow you might play azarenka . can you tell us a bit about her , what the key would be to beating her ?
can you tell us a bit about radwanska , what kind of player she is .
how much of a comfort is it for you to have your mother around ?
another compelling performance . how can you rate your match today ?
your next opponent is either serena williams or lucie safarova . what can you tell us about both of them ?
you talked earlier in the week about the work you 've done on your serve and return game . what specifically have you done to improve those areas this season ?
last couple of weeks you 've made a huge change in your game , suddenly gone up . what do you put it down to ? confidence , a change in what you 've done ?
how would you compare the state of your game now and when you were no.1 ?
serena has kicked into another gear . she was having a tough time the first half of the year . when this happens are you like , wow , or do you say , this is serena , this is what she does ?
outside of serena , who do you see your biggest challenger here in montral ?
what is your mindset after this difficult match ?
are you able to pinpoint what seems to be the problem with your serve right now ?
it seemed you could n't get any rhythm with it , and many breaks allowed today . seemed to be the same yesterday .
the unforced errors , was that a case of trying to go for big shots ?
would it have been better if there had n't been that second rain delay ? did that throw you off at all ?
difficult conditions , two rain delays . considering you do n't have as many matches under your belt as you probably would like at this stage of the season , do you think it affected you more than it affected her ?
do you think the two rain delays affected you more than her because you do n't have as many matches ?
do you think of this whole hard court season as a process , that you want to keep getting better and better towards the us open and peak at that right moment ? do the players consider that overall ?
are we going to see you again in montral ?
the crowd seemed to be rallying to your cause . at the end a huge standing ovation . almost got the sense it was as much a thank you for coming as appreciative of the efforts of your opponent . did you feel the love of the fans today ?
you said you have areas to work on between now and the us open . what areas do you see yourself working on to improve for the next tournament and ultimately the us open ?
what made the difference today ?
how good is it for your confidence for the next match ?
how does it rank for you as a victory to win over such an impressive player ?
how were you able to manage and keep your focus and control during the rain delays ?
tomorrow you play either jankovic or vandeweghe . do you have thoughts on them ?
you were in the semifinal in washington . it seems to be going really well . have you made some changes or ...
how do you change from french to wimbledon , then wimbledon to hard courts ? which do you find more difficult ?
you 've been on a roll for a couple of weeks . how do you explain your recent success ?
do you feel that you have the support of the crowd here ?
do you have a chance to go around the city ? what do you do here ?
what are your goals for the rest of the season ?
do you feel you 're still far from that no.1 that you held a couple years ago ?
i do n't want to be rude or anything , but do you feel that your head is free now that everything is over with all those stories about your splitup ? do you feel you see clearer and your head is free ?
your next rival is shelby rogers , who beat eugenie bouchard yesterday . you 've never played her . do you know a little about her ? how do you approach that match ?
is it a good thing that you do n't have to face eugenie bouchard or not ?
i know in the recent weeks we 've noticed several changes in your game . how much do they help you to achieve whatever you wish to achieve ?
not having to face eugenie in the next match , do you feel it will be an advantage for you to have the crowd on your side instead of having it against you ?
would you pinpoint something that 's different from your success recently ? did you change something specific that you would say ?
yesterday were you concerned at all with everything that went on here with the power failure ? was there something funny that happened to you ?
it was your first game back for a while now . how did you feel out there ?
you switched from grass to hard court . does it take you a little while to get your game going on hard court ?
your next rival is carla suarez navarro . how are you going to approach that match ?
did the power failure affect you in any way ?
what were you happy about today ? what do you need to tweak a bit more ?
what has it been like without the power ?
are there candles ?
so how did it go ?
you could be facing eugenie bouchard in the third round . you 've never played her ?
( question regarding longevity on tour . )
you 'll be running the new york marathon in a couple of months . are you bored with tennis ? is that something you 've been wanting to do ?
are you going to train in a different way ?
do you have a time you would like to achieve ?
any particular reason you 're doing it this year ?
are there any other options for charity or was it always going to be a marathon ?
serena approaching 18 grand slam titles , talk about her achieving that .
whose idea was it to do the miami thing ?
we felt left out . you 've never come before .
is serena practicing her french with you ?
how did the first win in montral feel for you ?
do you think you can take out that no.1 seed ?
given your condition , do you have weeks that are better than other ?
how long do you feel you can still play ?
how long has it been since you went old school on the scoreboard with the power going out ?
we see a lot of players from the '90s , martina hingis , kimiko date . how do you beat father time , keep the energy going against girls much younger ?
what has impressed you about eugenie bouchard ?
what can you say about your next opponent ?
in terms of eugenie bouchard , in terms of her popularity , what does that do for the wta brand do you think going forward ?
can you describe the type of game you had today ? are you satisfied with the way you played ?
would you say you 're playing your best tennis right now in your career ?
has there been anything special you 've been doing for the rise in your level ?
obviously you 're going to play eugenie bouchard next . what is your feeling on playing the hometown favorite ?
you 've played against her before , but it was in 2011. do you remember anything about that ?
when you see her now , do you see a player your age or a top 10 player you have to really fear ?
what 's the key to beating her ?
could you tell us what it 's like to play against a girl who has little experience and against a crowd like this one tonight in montral .
the second set was pretty difficult for you . last week you lost in the first round in stanford . how is the adaptation going for the hard courts ?
can you talk about her game a little bit .
your next rival is heather watson . you played her this year . what can you say about her game and how you 're going to approach that match coming up ?
what is the feeling for you right now , pride to have taken the second set against a top 10 player or disappointment to have lost ?
at what point did you feel that homecourt advantage , that the crowd was really rallying to your cause , especially in that second set ?
at the end of the match , your former coach was here . what did he mean to you in your career ?
what coming out of a match like that do you feel is the number one thing that you 'd like to improve on ?
one gets calmer the more they do it . did you feel in moments that would be something that comes in the future , that will help ? it 's new being on center court with the whole nation watching , things like that .
it was fun to watch your emotions , fist pumps . but there were moments of frustration , too , that we could read in your body language . do you believe in just kind of letting your emotions out in the moment or are you trying to work more towards an even keel ?
what was going through your mind when you had the fourth ball hit the net and drop in ?
what did you learn tonight ? did you see what you needed to do to reach that higher level ?
how was the crowd ?
what do you have to improve ?
of course , some injuries have set you back . did you set some goals for this year ?
what did she tell you when you were at the net ?
what positive lessons can you draw from this for the future ?
what did jeanclaude tell you ?
were you expecting that kind of match and did you think you would be able to win a set ?
after the match , there was long minutes with the towel over your head . i 'd like to know what your feelings , your thoughts at that moment . were you also crying ?
congratulations on a fantastic tournament . can you tell us a little bit about , you know , how different it is for a player walking into their first grand slam final , and how does a player manage these emotions ?
how tough was it to adjust your pace of play ? she appeared to be very slow . were you surprised that it nearly twoandahalf hours before she got a warning for time from the umpire ?
simona , 44 in the third set . you had a moment yeah , this is the moment . what happened between the umpire and you ? i thought there was like you was about to serve and he turns and tells you something .
technically speaking , what do you think the difference was in the match ? what did she do better than you maybe thought she would ? what did you do either worse or better ?
it did look a little hopeless in the tiebreaker for you . can you just talk about where your mind was when you were down so far in the tiebreaker .
and you fought so very hard ; so did she . it was a very tough mental battle out there . talk about her mental toughness , her ability to fight . she seemed to come back again and again when you were trying to ...
it was a great final . the public obviously loved it . now , besides lacking grand slam experience , an hour and a half later , what do you wish you could do better in this match ? for instance , did you come to the net enough or maybe you were lacking some confidence in your smash ? what did you think you could have done better to improve your game ?
what have you learned about yourself over these past two weeks ?
on a happier note , i know how much you love shopping . do you have any plans ? this is a nice check you 're going to walk away with here .
it seems that not only the romanians that were here but french people , the public , they were also beside you , a lot of them . how did you feel this ?
second set , down a break , your serve was troubling you . how do you find the result ? how do you work in those situations ?
the last three matches you played here were all like thriller matches high tensions , critical moments , comebacks . can we say that in a way this was maybe even better to build yourself confidence maybe even more so than winning easier matches ?
what did you feel was the difference between the first set and the two sets that you won ? did you make any adjustments after the first set that you think made a difference ?
you came through a lot today ; you came through a lot the in past three matches ; you have come through a lot in your career . just talk about your toughness . where do you think it comes from ? is that something you 've worked on ? is that something you 're really proud of ? could you talk about that ?
you played her twice about this time last year . obviously we all know she 's a better player . in what ways did you sense she 's an improved player now ?
how do you know that she throws herself into her shots ? were you studying her or did you notice that today ?
you found your serve back in the third set . what happened at that point in the match ? was it just a timing issue ?
is it a different kind of intensity at all for you when you 're playing a player who is a young player still trying to establish herself and maybe has a different sort of hunger than someone who is closer to your generation , especially in this sort of match where it could really transform her career to win it ?
what do you think the next step is for her to get closer on par ?
you 're a great fighter . i would like to know that if you think to be a slow starter is something you 're not used to or that you 're becoming this now , or if is just a coincidence ? or you think that you have tension because maybe you 're thinking you 're the favorite of the tournament ? i do n't know . there is any reason , in your opinion , that for three times in a row , more or less ...
you have used a lot of energy and probably adrenaline to get to this point , so i want to sort of check in to see where your energy is and how you 're feeling physically . where does this rank in terms of the grand slam finals you 've reached in terms of difficulty ?
where does this rank as far as the difficulty of getting to another grand slam final in terms of your career ?
do you think your movement is actually improving with age ?
yeah ?
yes .
how do you feel right now ? what was difficult today against simona , the most difficult for you ?
is there a point or a game that right now in this moment you 're still kind of replaying in your head or you 're thinking about , one shot ?
does this seem something foreign to you out there , or did it feel like another match ?
when you played her in nuremberg last year , the final , did you have any sense that she was going to be able to get to this level this quickly ?
back to you as the imaginary journalist . if you were writing the story of your 2014 french open , what would be your lead ? how would you start the story ?
and the one or two things you 'd like to most like to work on ?
do you take the time to celebrate this result ? is it something you can do that for ?
is it weird to kind of have this , you know , great result , great two weeks , and a really great clay season bookended by charleston , and now here and you now have to move to grass ?
the crowd was very much with you today , but how had you envisioned the match beforehand ? what went for you as expected or what went wrong ? what went different from your plans from last night ?
you seemed to tire in the third set somewhat . was it mental , physical , or am i wrong about that ?
i think you had two games where you had i think 40love and ended up losing the games . do you remember anything about those or not ?
last year when you played her it was second round , kind of a damp day , and the place was n't full . can you compare the experience of that to playing her this year with a packed house and people kind of going nuts ?
what did you feel was the difference between the first set you played and the last one ? how did you feel the experience was a bit different from your first semifinal in australia at the beginning of the year ?
what are your feelings on this ultimately ending with a loss today ? seems like the whole way you had a belief could and almost should in your mind be able to win today . overall , is it disappointment , or something that you feel like you 're still moving forward ?
despite the loss today you have been on an incredible upward trend . in a word or two , what do you consider your greatest strengths and what 's the one thing you want to work on most ?
do you think you can do at wimbledon what you 've done here and at melbourne ?
this is the third time you have played her . she 's a huge character in women 's tennis . is there any difference in her presence across the net from you now ?
even though you lost today , it was really a close match and you could have won the match . you reached the semis two grand slams in a row . so now do you feel you belong to top 5 or maybe you deserve more than your ranking ?
what is the biggest problem on clay against sharapova ?
at the end of the second set , perhaps beginning of the third set , would you say it 's because you did n't have enough experience that you went down a little ?
at the beginning of the year , were you convinced as well that you could be that strong a player , even on clay ? what 's your best surface ? if you have to play the match of your life , which is the surface you 're going to choose , please ?
will you go to birmingham first or will you have a short rest because you have played many matches recently ? will you take one or two days off to visit paris or something else ?
it 's your second semis in a row , so it 's a very convincing beginning of a season . how would you appraise this first beginning ? how would you judge , appraise , evaluate your performance so far ? that is , to have two semifinals in a row in a grand slam .
must be a great satisfaction . what was going through your mind when you were down 20 at the beginning ? were you worried or tense or what ?
her serve was helping you quite a bit . her serve was very weak today , more than usual . do you think that ? and you were always attacking since the beginning .
at the end , trying to close out that match , and as it looked like , you know , scoreboardwise , you were in a really good position to win , what was going through your head ? what were the nerves ? what was that experience like ?
what 's your feeling after the match point when her ball goes out ?
you talked about your coach . that 's eric . can you tell us what you worked on for the past few months and what it 's like ?
to your credit , you 're so open , so emotional . when you had all your setbacks , what was the worst moment , the worst time when you had the greatest doubt ? likewise , now that you have had this incredible achievement , what could you say to yourself ? what is your feeling ?
you said after your previous match that you lost your love for tennis last year and considered other careers , such as journalism . you have written for various media . how would you write about your comeback from the injuries and your performance here ?
you had some tough matches . last three against players ranked much lower than errani . are you at all surprised that you were able to come out and win 62 , 62 over a top player like that ? or did you sort of feel it coming together even though the matches might not have shown it ?
you seem more relaxed today than a few years ago .
you mentioned the other day nietzsche , camus , and other philosophers . how would freud , for instance , analyze that ? do you think it has anything to do with you stopping the petko dance ?
you did n't do any more the petko dance , even if everybody always hopes that you do it because it 's fun , but are you superstitious ? because we saw you kissing your racquet . i 'd like to know if when you kiss your racquet you want next match to start with the same racquet or you do n't think about it or it will be different if it was the racquet winning a grand slam ?
in charleston , you 're you were hopping on a plane to go to fed cup , and you said that that trip to australia might derail your entire clay court season . for a while it looked like that might be the case ; not great results coming up into here . so did you think that this was possible before the tournament started ?
the amount of press that tennis players have to do after a match , talking to so many different people , often being asked the same question over and over again , how difficult is that ? do you sometimes think tennis players have to do so much more than other sports stars ?
in the deeper of yourself , do you really think it 's a surprise to see you this level of the tournament , or you believe is the level you have to have , this is your place ?
if you , inside yourself , think finally you arrive where you deserve to be .
it 's very difficult to play against halep . what was the difficult point to play ?
there was one point in the second set where you applauded one of her shots . she seemed to wrong foot you or catch you off balance a few times with her game . do you think the timing of her strokes is very good ?
in the first set at 42 , there was a point where you stretched to the backhand side and your foot slipped . is that where you hurt your leg , or was that something that came up later in the match ?
you think that the rain delay affected your game today ?
do you think she can win the tournament ?
i mean , from what you have seen in the semifinal , do you think she 's good enough to beat bouchard or sorry , petkovic ?
how do you feel about just , you know , back in the quarterfinals of a slam ? just your progress , your clay season has been ...
did you feel in the match like today from the very beginning you were just going to be off ? could you feel that from the start ?
the injury was thigh ? hamstring ?
it went smoothly today . how do you feel on court ?
it seems to me that the more matches you win , the more people find out about the operation you had about five years ago . does that make you uncomfortable , or do you think it can actually help young girls in a similar difficult situation ?
how did you feel about this atmosphere ? most of the audience are behind you and they are cheering for you .
after the australian open quarterfinal you were not as happy as you are today . i think you described it as not a very good match . so did you look back on that match at all ?
and prepare for the nerves this time ?
can you just talk a little bit about your next opponent , andrea petkovic ?
the other players in the semifinals are taller , and they also seem to hit the ball a bit harder than you do . do you actually practice hitting the ball harder and becoming stronger the way justine henin used to ?
the timing of your shots seems to be perhaps one of your strong points . you seem to time it very well . the few times you wrong footed svetlana on the court . is that to do with your relaxation ? how do you get the timing so good on your shots ?
( in romanian . ) wrong footing ?
no one talks about tactics as good as you do .
no one . no other female player does it .
i 'm very glad too . do you watch a lot of tennis ?
and you do n't watch videos of your opponents or anything ?
you just have your game plan and you execute ?
speaking of tactics and strategies , are you kind of a player who prepares different kind of tactics depending on your opponent , or ...
your coach always praises your footwork . he even said you have footballer 's legs . could that be a compliment ?
do you think you can become the second romanian woman to win a grand slam in paris ?
obviously a tough match for you out there today . what was she doing out there differently from madrid that made it tough for you to get a hold in the match ?
why do you think you lacked the power and the energy ?
you have been playing doubles . obviously you play doubles and singles at the grand slams . does that make it harder to keep up your energy if you go deep in both ?
i have heard you have had some problems with the media after doubles and you wrote a letter about it . has that contributed to your sort of fatigue or energy on court ?
you did it again . but what did you think after that first set loss ?
it can look different from the outside than how you guys are playing it , but where did that match turn for you ? where do you think ?
when we look to your matches against stosur or muguruza , especially in second sets , at difficult moments you seem so , like trying to dig the best out of you . like what keeps you going ? is it your desire to win the tournament here or simply the refusal to lose a tennis match ?
5all in the second she goes up 30love , and then you reel off two unreturnables and a winner to break there . it seemed like things really , really turned there . were you aware of that being a particularly important point in the match ? what was going on ?
asking you about genie bouchard , she 's come through quite a battle today and she a very ambitious player . do you recognize anything of yourself in her and the fighting attitude she seems to have ?
thinking about the evolution of your game on this surface , how much do you think that 2008 shoulder surgery maybe contributed to forcing you to work on things that in the end helped you inadvertently or not on this surface ?
in terms of movement , in terms of not relying on your serve as much .
when garbine beat serena , she did it quickly ; i think in a little over an hour . match started off quickly for you losing the first set . what were you doing to slow it down and change the pace where you could get a foothold and stop her momentum ? how much of that is actually slowing down the match and taking more time between the points to gather yourself ?
somebody tweeted a photo of you looking young teenager with a very small bouchard . what is your first memory of when you first crossed her path ?
did you think she was a prospect then ?
were you surprised by the way garbine has been playing whole tournament ? you said about the ambition of the young players , how do you face it ? how do you prepare it ?
judy murray just tweeted sharapova is like a tea bag ...
judy murray . andy 's mom .
i will quote : sharapova is like a tea bag . put her into hot water , and you 'll find out how strong she is . people usually call you a fighter . how about being a tea bag ?
you do n't drink tea ?
put the bag in hot water ...
hot water . in hot water . water gets ...
how about it ? fighter and tea bag ? you ca n't relate ...
about genie bouchard , do you know her well on the tour ? nike sponsor ? not really ?
and then when serena was out of the tournament earlier , did you feel or out of the four semifinalists you 're the favorite . do you feel that pressure ?
can you remember the last time you lost a match because you came up a little bit short in the nerves department or because you just did n't go for it ?
four consecutive semifinals here . how do you assess that ?
did you feel more tired on clay than other surfaces in the earlier part of your career after matches ?
seemed to be a big experience for you . you were very , very close . in your own words , what happened ?
how difficult is it to play her ? because , you know , she likes to play slow ; she takes time between her two serves . is it difficult to deal with the level of intensity she brings to the court ?
in the third set it was a very long game . was that the turnaround ? how did you feel physically in the third set ? was it after losing that long game mentally a letdown ?
5all , second set , you 're right in there , one game away from it , 30love , and she comes back and wins that game . do you remember that as a particularly important point ?
you had a great open here . now do you also get your cell phone back from your coach now ?
that was the question .
how would you assess your whole tournament ?
you are one of the most standout players this year in french open . maria sharapova said is sort of a breakthrough tournament for you . i want to know , what do you think yourself and where you can go from here ?
maria sharapova said it 's sort of a breakthrough tournament for you this year , french open . i want to know what you think yourself and where you can go from here .
it seems you have some kind of inner belief in yourself . i mean , beating serena , you know , on a big court , easy ; today , going out there , winning the first set 61 to maria sharapova . is that something you have from yourself , that belief to win against the top players ?
you said after beating serena that you went out there thinking you had nothing to lose against the no.1 . how did you feel going out against maria today ?
you said clay is maybe your least favorite surface . you like grass . so now the wimbledon is coming up . how do you feel about going to your favorite surface ?
you started really well . your first set was almost perfect . what happened after the first set ? can you tell us why you 've changed your game and your style ?
would you say it 's the most painful defeat for you in your life ? because this match , during this match , you were so close .
you said that the details really counted for the turnaround in this match . could you give us examples of these details ?
well , i have the impression that you 're almost crying . is that true ?
you were up 54 ; then what happened to you ? it was something totally new : against sharapova on the central court ?
in the first set you played really well , but i also had the impression that there was like no opponent on the court . had someone just watched the first set , we would have thought you would win so easily . how come ? why were you that nervous afterwards ? it 's not usually you .
you 're not going to leave us now . there 's doubles . i think you met carla this morning . unfortunately she lost , as well . she was defeated .
you have said that you need to have more experience , experience of these grand slams and these types of matches , so that you can be more solid mentally .
52 down in the first set , 41 down in the third set . aside from the victory itself , what must be really pleasing is the way you managed to fight back in this match twice .
did you surprise even yourself with the comeback in the third ? and do you think the fact that the crowd cheered for you a lot , did it help ?
did you show that you were human when you doublefaulted on one of the match points ?
a lot of people this year have referred to you as the next maria sharapova . what are the positives and negatives for you of that title ?
regarding sharapova , how are your relations with her on the tour ? and also , you said that you started playing tennis when you saw her winning at wimbledon , but is that everything in the past obviously since last year ? because now you 're at that place and you can win slams . like is there still that childhood memory that you have to not think because now it 's different ?
can you recall the very first time you met maria , whether it was off court or on court ?
were you there as a fan then , or was that a tennis event ?
you looked quite emotional when you won the match . maybe more emotional than when you made the semis in australia . is that because the match was that close , or is any other explanation ?
your mental strength is clearly one of your big assets . same for maria . i just wonder when you watched her , was that one of the things you took from the way that she played ?
you seem to take suarez navarro 's serve very , very early . you were hitting the ball extremely early at some points . i was wondering if that was a strategy to unsettle her . and were you surprised by fabrice santoro 's selfie request ?
you 're the first canadian in semis in melbourne , first in semis as a canadian here in paris . how much does that mean ? is it important for you because you represent canada ?
tactically did you play too often on her backhand and not enough on her forehand , which was weaker for her ?
now , next round you 're going to play against maria sharapova , and people compare you quite often to her .
the crowd was here to support you during the match . would you say that during sharapova they will do the same ? that is , you have conquered the public against sharapova , who is very popular here ?
what are the weaknesses and strengths of sharapova , according to you ?
you have clear memories of the moment when you were seven or eight ? i think you said that in english . could you tell us more about this with maria ?
now you 've reached semis of a grand slam after australia . it 's a different surface . it 's clay . what would you say about this ?
you played a pretty tough , gritty competitor who has been on a run lately . how tough was it ?
what most disappointed about your performance today ?
overall a positive week for you , would you say , or no ?
do you feel like compared to some of the other top players you have run into in slams azarenka a couple times , serena that she was a little bit less daunting because she has less experience than the other ones ? how does that work ?
it 's very hard to read you . you do n't seem to go up or down . there is not much emotion showing one way or the other . are you feeling that way inside , too , or is just that you masking it well ?
is she underestimated , or underrated , for lack of a better word , by the general public ? she 's not a wellknown name . she does n't have a lot of glamor , aura , or anything else .
not in the rankings . she 's not very wellknown .
she 's risen quite a bit in the last couple years . how has her game changed and improved ?
looking ahead to wimbledon , what would you consider a successful wimbledon for you ?
this is the fourth time in the last sixth slams you 're the last american left , man or woman . pretty impressive . is that something you take pride in ?
no consolation at all ?
what do you see as your next step ? do you need like the real big win on a real big stage ? do you need to win a major ? in terms of your own rate of improvement , what are you looking for as doable but challenging ?
i do n't want you to say anything . just wondering what you 're thinking . do you feel like you 're ready and everything is falling in place and you could win a major , or is that still a little bit down the road ?
what a tough match .
what a shout in the end . you were so happy ?
so much of your tennis in the last two or three years has been trying to get back to where you were .
does this feel like you 've achieved that ?
still , you must be pretty happy ?
have you ever thought if an opponent wanted to stalk you on youtube and saw you dancing ?
you mentioned on the court philosophy and literature . obviously you 're in a country famous for philosophers . two questions : which philosopher has made the biggest impression on you ? and also the second one , which writer ? which author ?
you talked about the dancing .
so much of it on youtube . are you a different player in the way you celebrate your wins these days compared to a few years ago ? used to be quite a carnival at the end of your matches . are you a little bit more grown up about it now ?
kiki seemed to have a bit of a mental breakdown after the first set . seems to happen a lot in female tennis . can you understand why ?
not only , but it seems to happen a bit more ...
i read some article which said when you are out of the tour you are thinking about retirement . so i was wondering how close you are quitting or giving up your career ?
that was a great answer , by the way .
thank you , very nice . this may seem a dumb question after that answer , but do you actually think you 're equipped to win a slam ? here we are in a very , very open women 's championship this year . do you think you are able at this stage to contemplate actually winning a slam ?
you have played four players now who were ranked i think 70 and worse . do you think it will be at all easier in the next round ? jankovic , errani . you get to finally feel a little bit more nothing to loseish ?
exactly .
when you were coming up as a player , how did you handle the financial challenges on the tour ? how much does it cost just to travel each year ? when do you break even ?
you 're clearly a very thoughtful person , many interests outside of tennis . going back to what you said about philosophy . could you , for example , after tennis imagine yourself being a teacher or something like that , teaching philosophy ?
what 's been the most gratifying or satisfying aspect of this journey for you back the last two , three years ?
so are you patient with yourself , even if you 're not patient with other things in general ?
you 're such a good storyteller . from the old days when you were traveling from village to village and by yourself , can you think of any tale or story that would be fun of hotels without electricity or misconnections .
when you were thinking of other things that you might do , what were some of those things ?
obviously you like philosophy and keeping the world in perspective and all that goes into that . why do you think at the same time it 's hard for you to keep winning and losing sometimes in perspective and why it still affects you so deeply so often ?
congratulations for your victory . i want to ask you about the next opponent . what do you think about halep ?
in the last match you win with halep . do you think that now will be different match ?
what represent roland garros for you ?
just about the match in general , especially that first set was so close and a long first set .
is this a disappointment to you or what 's your take away from this year ?
obviously you know that sara has been doing very well lately . can you say like what is to play against her on clay ? what makes her so successful on this surface ? she beat you twice in a row now . how you felt on court ?
there are a few players left in this tournament who are the only players from their own country in the tournament . how do you feel about representing romania in this tournament ?
she 's a tough opponent . you lost to her a couple of times . tell me about the match today and what you felt like you did better than in the past .
you have won a lot of matches in the last year . talk about how that process has helped you at these bigger tournaments . you won a lot of smaller tournaments , a lot of matches all over the place .
you say you love clay . why is it ? is it because it 's more tactical than the other surfaces ?
what prompted you to take off the visor ?
what prompted that ?
you and sloane were ranked pretty close together , but you have made a jump up since then . what advice would you give to her ?
what advice would you give to sloane for her career ?
do you feel ready to win this tournament ?
could you just talk about the match , especially that first set ? it was very close . then you seemed to really just grind her down in the second set .
the fact that jankovic had a muscle problem and also the fact that she had like a big crowd cheering for her during the match , especially the first tough set , does sometimes make it hard to concentrate ?
looked like you got a little frustrated in the second set when you threw the racquet . what were your thoughts at the time ?
what do you think was the difference in the third set when you came back ?
this is not about the match , but writing about coming up and financial burdens and challenges . how much does it cost to play on the tour , and how do you meet those challenges ?
is that basically the dividing line , top 100 ?
sam , what you do you take from a match like that today going forward ?
what had you done in the leadup knowing you had that record against her to get yourself to that level where you were taking it to her ?
was it something you thought that changed on your end or she was upping her level drastically ?
obviously a great player , especially on this surface . when you say you 're doing well , what 's it feel like when at she starts doing four , five , up to eight games in a row for her and you ca n't stop it ?
given how much carnage there was in this draw , you have to be a little frustrated you were in a section where the top seed still held up with maria .
in a few weeks ' time you 'll look on this more as an opportunity lost , given the draw ands everything , or will you take the positives , the fact that you were able to sort of regain some of your best form ?
anything concrete as to what clicked in your form ? just a case of getting your confidence back or something like that ?
of all the times that you 've played her , has she ever been as antsy as she was in the match today with the amount that she screamed , putting aside the grunting and getting vocally aggressive and all that ?
just looking ahead to the grass , how do you feel about approaching that ? obviously some good stuff to build on from last year at wimbledon .
plans ? eastbourne again ?
when she 's , you know , screaming and pumping both fists after winning a point , when you 're standing there , what goes through your mind ? obviously you just lost the point , but in terms of the reaction , because it 's unusual .
looking at wimbledon , obviously you make changes for the grass . is there stuff that you can take that you have had off the court here that translates well going there , the stuff that you 've been talking about , you know , everything clicking , being able to execute what you do well ? is it as simple as just transporting that over to the uk ?
can you tell us about the match ? was it a nightmare ? you lost nine points in a row . what happened in your mind ? how did you come back ?
can you say that it was a good week ? can you be positive ?
are you sick ?
you were saying that you did n't have a lot of dynamism . is it true ?
can you tell us about this match ? i mean , you were on center court . what were your feelings playing on the center court ?
how do you manage such a day ? there are long matches . you do n't know exactly what will be the outcome of the other matches . you did n't know whether you would step on court .
what about light ? there was not a lot of light .
your run at roland garros , is it going to change things for the next weeks ?
what are you going to do next ?
do you think that your run here will prevent you from going through the quallies ?
any image , any moment that you will bear in mind at this french open ?
congratulations . how do you feel about all this ? just kind of a whirlwind , unexpected week and a half for you into the quarterfinals .
do you feel like you 're playing almost with nothing to lose for the rest of this tournament ? you 've already achieved a great result and everything like that . what 's your mentality now ?
do you have much interaction with sharapova at all ? i think you 're both img , sponsored by them . have you ever interacted with her at all ?
how much have you seen her play ?
match seemed to be not so hard for you , not so tough for you .
what were your feelings about this crowd ? it was the first time when you played against such a big crowd ?
so what are your thoughts about your nextround match against maria ? have you thought about it at all ? what do you think ?
what impresses you the most about her , her game , when you 've watched her play ? what stands out to you ?
obviously we are at roland garros . i 'm really interested in your thoughts about grass season . for sure it 's not the best surface for spain , for spanish people .
do you think you can this year improve also on grass ?
did the crowd 's behavior upset you in your play ?
for your next match , whose side the crowd is going to be on , you think ?
sharapova , during her press conference , said that people had started hearing about you , that maybe this was the tournament of your life , and that you defeated serena .
what happened inside your head when you defeated serena ? things started going very quickly .
i do n't know if players start looking at you in a different way already . maybe they respect you more . have you noticed anything ?
the first day you talked about martina hingis , and you said she was your idol . what do you think of sharapova ? did she inspire anything for you ?
you 're already in quarterfinals . is this going to add something to your career ? are you going to go to singapore ?
it was a straightforward match . what do you think makes it so tough to play eugenie ?
do you think genie could have a shot at the title ? i mean , now the women 's draw is so open .
what do you think you could have done maybe a little bit better ? physically , were you 100 % and fine ? was there any issues there also ?
it 's a big occasion on center court a little bit early though . do you have any idea before you come out that you 're not feeling that you 're a little bit out of it , or is it just something that all of a sudden the match starts and you realize , well , my legs are n't there and i 'm just not here and what can i do to change it ?
did you have a plane to catch today ?
how can you explain such a great start ?
when was the last time you felt your level of play was as good as today ?
talking about your next match , can you say something about the two players that you might be up against , suarez navarro and the croatian player ?
tennis is a very international sport . talk about yourself . you are canadian by flag . but how much you are canadian by tennis . which sort of tennis do you think do you have inside yourself ? is american ? is whatever ?
you know going in that her second serve is something that you can attack and it 's also something that you 're very good at doing . i was wondering if you focused on that at all in practice before this match . if you go out there with an idea that you 're just going to go for it hard and if it does n't work , scale it back a bit . do you have a plan for that particular part of the match ?
the last two matches you started very poorly . do you think it was more respect for her today that helped you start so well ?
you said obviously you played suarez navarro before and you just said sometimes you have to adapt to your opponent . what is it about her game that might be difficult for you and you might have to adapt to in particular ?
when the match is finished , do you ask about which result , raonic or which person , which other player in the tournament ? which is your best friend on tour ? and if you can pick this friend to go around in paris today , now , what you would like to go ?
i asked about raonic and the result when you finish .
maybe you have an idea where you would like to go after today in paris . we are in paris , remember .
you wanted to improve some things in your game today . but beating a top 10 player , 1 and 2 , do you feel you played almost perfectly ? is that as good as ...
you 're not going to sightsee , but you ca n't avoid not eating . this is a pretty good city to eat in . is there anything special you 've been taking advantage of ?
if you do play suarez , you have played a lot of matches since then , but do you remember anything specific about the match at wimbledon that you can learn from ? you certainly were n't as aggressive in that one , as i recall , as you are now just on a regular basis .
what are your impressions of the genie army ? how many troops are there ? are you in contact ? are you going to order them around ?
is owen wilson now part of the genie army ? noticed that picture yesterday .
you saw the first three seeds going out . was that something that surprised you , or how did you react to that from the inside ? because people from the outside think it 's a big shock to see the top three go out . how do you view it as a player ?
you mentioned owen wilson . did you see `` midnight in paris '' ?
we feel you are very comfortable both physically and mentally since the beginning of this tournament . do you have good feelings ?
since your semifinal in the australian open , has your life changed a bit ? do you feel that people look at you differently ?
you 're saying your life changed . not long ago you were still playing in juniors . you were successful moving from junior to senior , which is not very easy . and it seems that you 're very focused on your goal , which is to become no.1 in the world . nothing will make you change your mind ?
but you seem more mature than you should be given your age .
30 is fine .
no.1 sport in canada is ice hockey . does that mean that for a tennis player there is less pressure on you ? look at djokovic and ivanovic in serbia , they are huge stars , but in canada , maybe people do n't talk about tennis that much . is it good for you not to have too much pressure or do you think tennis should be more popular ?
six straight times second week of a slam . most of anybody on the women 's tour , active streak . not bad . you must be pretty happy to keep it going ?
why do you think this keeps happening for you ? it 's a good thing , obviously .
throw us a bone . there is a little bit of disparity between your play in the slams and some of the regular tour . so anything , something . what 's going on ( laughter ) ?
do you feel like a different person when you get to these big tournaments ?
do you buy the notion there can be like they are clay court specialists and indoor specialists . could you be a slam specialist ?
how about this ? they say stefan edberg , he had a fire in his belly , he had real desire , passion . so do you have that more at grand slams than the other tournaments ?
you have a lot of experience playing late in grand slams . simona , you are playing next , does not . how do you think that experience is going to help you in the next match ?
obviously for the men slams are different , best of five . so women , not really . but what feels different about a slam match ? i 'm trying here .
what do you remember about your last meeting with her in australia ? how do you think her game has changed since then ?
do you feel like some of the things you have been working on with paul are starting to click in at this tournament , or can you talk about , you know , what you have been working on ? do you feel like those things are starting to be incorporated in your game more easily ?
you 're one of the players , maybe the highest ranked player that has n't won a title . would it be nice to start
would it be nice to start here ?
of course back to our favorite topic of the day , what if the fabulous , marvelous grand slam sloane stephens would play a match against the ordinary , not so great , regular circuit sloane stephens ? what would the score be ?
to that point , do you think your first title will come at a slam ?
totally different silly question .
how many of those head bands do you have ? how many colors ? is it like a mood ring ?
greatly color coordinated , but do you feel it in the morning ?
about what to wear and
simona described you as much younger than she is . do you feel much younger ?
one year .
do you look at her as being much older ?
great match . how do you feel after this great victory for you , second time in the fourth round here in paris ?
how did you feel in your tennis today ? everything was going good for you ?
from the beginning of the match , you were in your match until the end . it was okay for you . even if you lost one match point at 52 .
you have a love story with paris . you played very well in coubertin ? do you remember ?
next round ? svetlana kuznetsova ? how do you feel about that ?
first time in the second week of a slam since 2011. how does it feel ?
how did you feel physically ? because the doctor went . how do you feel ?
what was bothering you ?
obviously you 're feeling terrible . do you feel more pride surviving , given those circumstances ?
is that why your celebration was a little bit muted in the end ? it was n't big . was it because you were n't feeling great ? are you good friends ?
you said at one point you said to yourself , oh , just shut up . tennis players are out there for hours just with themselves . must have an incredible inner dialogue just going on . talk about your own inner dialogue . sometimes does it get way out of hand where there are some funny moments with that ?
is it because you had so many injuries that you said , okay , that 's not your problem today for me ?
you get kiki bertens next as a qualifier . being in the second week obviously is a big opportunity . i know every player who has gotten there is playing well . but probably as a seed against a qualifier you feel more pressure .
despite your physical condition , obviously you have been coming back , having some better and better results . is this kind of a confirmation to get this far at a major tournament like this that you are really back ?
this is a place of highs and lows for you .
well , i suppose it 's not easy . you were defeated 64 during the third set . how did you feel during the match and how do you feel now , please ?
physically was there something that hurt at the bottom part of your back , which was the case last time you played a match ?
what would you say is the most frustrating thing now that you 're leaving the courts ? you 're disappointed , of course . is it because you could n't show what you wanted to show on the courts , or because you could n't open up or something like this ?
offhand , you 're disappointed , that 's true , we can see this . but then this roland garros is a very good roland garros for you . i suppose that you will certainly build on this experience , this roland garros , this year , this tournament , this competition ? in a way , it 's a renewal , a new start ?
well , what about your development , then ? even though you 're not satisfied , you 've done so many things with the balls , things that perhaps you did n't do in the past or less often , like these chopped balls . and you kicked your serves . is this something you 're going to work on ? this is a change in your game , i 'd say .
it was a huge fight for you out there , serving twice for the match . then the injury . how did you go through all of those stages of the match ?
you had an injury in that match , a problem apparently with your right leg . can you tell us exactly what it is and when did you start feeling it during the match ?
obviously it was a close match . you both had your chances . she has n't really done a lot for a few years . what do you think of her level in general ? is she capable of winning this tournament ?
are you ready to get back on the grass where you have also had a lot of success ?
is the disappointment bigger because serena lost , li na lost , and maybe there was a lost opportunity for you here ?
so what is it with you and these long threeset matches at majors ? you seem to get stuck in them all the time .
did you feel going into today 's match that you were due for a big win ? you have come so close the last few weeks of getting that big win over a big player , radwanska or other players . did you feel almost like you were due ?
the top three seeds are out of this tournament , and the draw looks pretty open . does this victory give you the confidence to believe that you could be one of the contenders for the title ?
was it difficult to stay focused after the medical timeout ? how did you handle that ? because it was quite long .
what were you thinking on the first match point when petra hit the line with that volley ?
as you said , you ran a lot and your defense today was incredible . you must be particularly proud of that . physically are you feeling good after a match like this ?
what is the mentality when you play petra ? i mean , she 's such a big hitter of the ball , she can a lot of times take the racquet out of your hand . so mentally how did you go into this match ?
you have such a good record here . every time you come to paris , do you feel like you 're capable of winning the whole thing ?
i believe you get to play another lefty in your next match , lucie safarova . i guess at least you got a good practice against a lefty .
coming into this french open , compared to the last two or three , mentally do you feel fresher this year ? no , yes ?
i 'm asking you .
this is a bit silly , but i do n't know if you 've realized that you had five years between your first two slams and now it 's five years .
have you realized that ?
sometimes with players who achieve success at such a young age and you 're a very talented player , pure talent
that 's where i 'm going . so you 're a very talented player . you won early . when you look back on your career , do you think that there were ever decisions that you made about your career after that that maybe you regret , almost like , oh , i won a slam . was there work ethic issues after that ? were you always a hard worker , always focused , professional ? when you look back on your career , were there ever decisions that you regretted ?
no , i 'm asking . some players think they were .
it 's been five years since you won the french open the last time . the player you played against on the final of a french open is dinara . recently she retired . so of course she has n't been on the tour for a couple of years . but still , what are your thoughts on her retirement ?
you seem exhausted , but the match was really quick for you . you 're in second week . it was great today for you ?
the paris crowd seemed to engulf you as you left the stadium for autographs . but in the last game there were some boos when you were toweling off . what was the thing there ?
do you appreciate your popularity in paris ? is it as much as you wish ? would you want it to be more ? is it mixed ?
you 're going to face errani again next in the next round . that was a tough match for you in rome . what do you think you need to make different ?
when you look back , obviously you made the final at the us open , made semis a few times here , is this a slam , given that you 're great on clay , that you think has kind of slipped through your fingers , that maybe you 're almost surprised you have n't won yet ?
do you think you have had more chances to win this one than the u.s. or more to win the u.s. than the french ?
serena , li na and radwanska have lost . you 're no.6 . do you think that you 're now one of the main favorites ?
i keep reading about your dress . this dress you wore today , is that the one you wore in the first match ?
but you do your own line , as well , though ? but it 's not tennis clothes ? is that right ?
you have to sit in front of us and answer questions all the time , and i 'm just curious , if we were interviewing marko about you , what would he say about what it 's like to coach you or be your brother , anything ?
what went wrong today with your game , your feelings on the court ?
you had lost your four last matches to her and now a fifth one . does it play in your head when you go in knowing you have that record against her ?
when you have an off day like today , what do you feel you need to do to have a chance to get into the match ?
with four of the top five seeds losing , did you feel you lost a really opportunity to go deep here ? because you had been playing well up until today .
now that you 're out of the tournament , what will you do ? will you take some time to maybe enjoy the city and visit the city ?
you talked with your coaches after the match ? what do you think of your season right now ? your best performance was in australia . wimbledon is arriving soon . how do you feel about that ?
now that you 're out of the tournament and many seeds are out of the tournament , the press is talking a lot about sharapova 's way being cleared . who do you think can make a hard , difficult match against sharapova ? do you have other candidates that you can think of ?
are you surprised that your matches are going so easy for you and that you 're playing well ? you seem to be enjoying it . how come . how do you feel about that ?
how does it feel to go this far at this french open ?
it 's still first week of roland garros , a grand slam , but at this point you are the highestranking player remaining in this tournament . how do you feel about that ? how do you think it happens ?
you just mentioned sloane . what is tough about her game for you ? what do you think are her strengths ?
is virginia still a part of your team ?
can you tell us what can you learn from such a player ? she 's the only grand slam player from romania , right ?
so she helps you with the more mental aspects of the game ?
you talk a lot about your inner confidence . you 're still young . your career went very quick . but where do you get your inner confidence from ? is it in the genes ? is it in the family ?
virginia speaks french . i think your coach speaks french , too .
do you speak a little bit french ?
you just said that you 're not that young , but relatively , you 're younger than the other top players , of course . before this tournament , we were talking about how like women 's tennis get older , like age 22 and 23 can dominate in this level . but now like you and genie and muguruza , this kind of younger generation came up and may be knocking on the door . do you feel like this is the tournament or moment that you guys , younger generation , can make a new achievement ?
romania has a tradition of being a great tennis country in nastase , tiriac . how is the support back home ? are they following you now more than before ?
is there a lot of interest in you ?
what is the best part of your country ? what 's the coolest thing about romania ?
the best part ...
when you travel the circuit , what is your favorite tournament and what is your favorite city ?
as you have had more success , you have had to work on your english a lot , too , off the court . can you talk about that ? because it certainly has improved in the last year .
yes .
sloane , for whatever reason , really seems to elevate her game at the slams . you 're a little more consistent . how do you approach entering each tournament no matter where it is ?
sloane does very well in grand slams .
how do you approach every tournament no matter whether it 's a major or a lesser tournament ?
what is the book you 're reading in english ?
you 're obviously the highest seed left in the draw . i was wondering if you care at all which courts you play on . does it matter at all ? the fans seem to focus on but most players do n't .
how would you reflect on your week in paris ?
could you talk about just over the past months , over the past year or so , how your game has improved . you seem to have really stepped up .
if you could say the one thing mentally that you had learned , what would that be ?
first grand slam main draw of your life . sum it up for us . most fun you 've ever had ? give us something about it .
was embracing those moments , as you mentioned , was the objective you said before coming here ? or was there some other objective like reaching third round , for example ?
you played a very good claycourt player today and she played very well for the first four or five games . what were you thinking ? i mean , because you 're so new to it all . she 's kind of blitzing you . were you panicking or feeling pressure ? what were you telling yourself ?
even some of the french fans were chanting your name . did you hear that ? what do you think about that ? what 's it like being on a bigger stage like that ?
you mentioned a few times this week about how you learned to believe in yourself and your talents and whatever . had you gone through a period where you were doubting that a little bit or wondering whether you turned pro too soon ? you seem very into that point .
second set was 21 , you had a break point to go to 31 and you hit a forehand , hooked it a little bit wide . how big was that point or do you think maybe the whole match was too much today in terms of how she was playing ?
tennis is a game with a lot of pressure early in people 's career , mid career , late career . you 've obviously had an incredible breakout here . the question is sort of , is she for real ? what is your feeling ? are you sort of , do you , in your gut , do you feel that you 're ready to make a real run here and that you 'll get far ? talk about that and your future , please .
you may well be in the running for a wildcard at wimbledon , i imagine , after this . how big a deal would that be for you if you were to receive one ? and if not , what are your hopes for qualifying and everything ?
i 'm pretty sure you noticed it , but there is some kind of increasing media attention around you . i bet it 's kind of new for you , as well . how do you cope with all that ?
a lot of times we see juniors who do really well and are successful , and then it does n't translate when they come here . your class , you were the no.1 junior , and then genie bouchard was right behind you and she won wimbledon the year that you won a couple there . did you see it , and why do you think you and genie have been able to come through ? any thoughts on that ?
your style is so refreshing and risky . do you think you 'll be able to keep that up or will you become just another power tennis player if you want to succeed ?
can you tell us something about your background ? what tennis means for you in your life ? how difficult maybe was it to get to this level where you are now and how good it is to be here now ?
you mentioned the expenses . just how expensive is it coming up from through the junior ranks ? what 's it like when you actually begin to make money to help pay off that ?
can you summarize your feelings about that one ?
the fact that serena and li na are gone already , was there a feeling in the locker room did you pick up that there is a chance here to knock these top girls off ?
how do you , after having a great win the last round , did you let yourself celebrate for a couple of hours and then it was back focusing , or how is your time frame ?
do you think that helped you follow it up then , because you were cool ?
for those of us who do n't know too much about you , how do you come to speak english so well ?
where was your family in the u.s. ?
with serena , li na , and now radwanska out , do you think it 's time for a new generation like you , muguruza , townsend to be at the top for this tournament ?
yeah .
you seem to be a little bit nervous during this press conference . is it your first press conference in such a big main room ?
this tournament seems like cinderella story for you .
she 's one of the most clever and crafty players out there . how did you deal with that and what was your thinking going in ? how did it roll out according to your expectations ?
i do n't know much about you . how did you get the opportunity to come to florida and train in chrissie evert academy ?
i read a q & a you did recently and it said chrissie is like your second mom .
did you speak to her going into this match ?
so she did n't give you any specific tips or anything for this ?
she 's very big on the mental game and on things like showing your body language and just being tough at the right times . is that the kind of thing you talk about with her ?
maybe you know who is next for you ?
so last year , you shot up the rankings . you 're on the rise . what do you think is really working for you as you 're moving up ?
when you 're about to serve out for the match , what was going on in your mind ? were you nervous , or how did you just keep cool in that moment ?
david taylor meant so much . can you talk a little bit about what he might have changed or told you ?
your next match is either navarro or taylor . could you talk about each opponent separately ?
it 's been a while between fourth rounds at slams . how pleasing is that ?
in some ways is it good to have that test ? the first two matches were pretty routine , to have more of a challenge this time and know you can get out of it ?
talking about hypotheticals at the moment , but if you do play maria in the next round , i guess it 's an opposite situation today where head to head you 're in the wrong end of that . how do approach that if that 's the case ?
do you feel you 're playing as well on the clay this week as you were in the year you had the run to the final ?
what do you think is the most important thing that 's clicking for you here at the moment ?
with all the seeds falling , radwanska today , as well , obviously can you focus on your next match ? but is it hard not to get a little excited and see it as a big opportunity maybe ?
have the matches against maria followed a particular pattern ? is there something you sort of trace through all those losses and a couple of recent wins that you can take out of that looking forward ?
there 's a little girl running around at the futures championship from your home state hoping to do the same thing you 're doing . do you think she has a bright future ? i hear you have had time with her in the past .
we have questions from fans to players . we do this every year . we have a question for you . fans found out that you 're particularly fond of french wine and ptisseries . the question is : does that not get to be a little problem when you 're in paris competing for a sporting event ?
but is it true that you 're ...
what is your preferred wine ?
could you say that you were saved by the rain ? because before the little shower , you made three double faults in the same game , and after that you ...
you get sam stosur next . that 's been a good match for you most of the time . you have both been playing well this tournament . what are your thoughts facing her relatively early in the tournament here ?
after the first three seeds are out of the tournament , do you see yourself as a possible candidate to the title of next sunday ?
i do n't know if you heard what ernests gulbis said this morning about his sisters . he was asked if his sisters , who play tennis , were going to be as good as him , and he answered , i do n't want my sisters to be tennis players , because , he said
yeah , you heard that .
i was wondering what you were thinking about it .
the previous question , asking you if you thought you were a favorite , i will ask a different one . famous italian broadcaster ends his broadcast asking the person , ask a question to yourself which you would like to answer and give me the answer . can you do that ?
yes , you ask . one question you would like to ask yourself .
this is questions from fans . it 's regarding your commercial that you did with novak a few years ago when you 're aiming for a can of balls on his head and you end up not hitting the can of balls but other balls . so the question is : is that special effects or is that real ?
tough luck today . can you talk about your feelings out there on the court ? what do you feel was n't really working for you today ?
did you know much about her going in and what in particular is difficult about her game , do you think ?
you have n't had a lot of success here like you have in , say , wimbledon . how do you feel about this tournament ? did you think you had an opportunity to go far this year , considering everything else that had happened ?
but in a different way , when the top two seeds come out , does that affect your serves at all or anything in like a negative way rather than thinking , i 'm going to win ? does it play in your head at all ?
a great moment , great emotions , the greatest moment in your career ?
can you tell us more about the match ?
can you tell us , you know , with the crowd , the public , i mean , it was like a davis cup atmosphere at the end of the match . did you use this as well ? that is , the public .
what about the medical timeout during the match ? did you think that this would change the match or did you manage to not think about it ?
do you think that your opponents will look at you differently from now on ?
today are you not more aware of your strengths ?
so you said , oh , shit ; i play like hell . that 's what you said . but when it was 54 , you laughed and you said , that 's good . maybe i was wrong .
you never had this distance to look at your match ?
there is a player probably you know of who got a wildcard ?
alexia .
each time you have lost the first set and you managed to come back , so it 's even more crazy , i 'd say . what 's missing ? what do you miss ? is it because it 's difficult for you to step in on the courts and to be in the match immediately ?
kristina , when she beat li na , she said the match after is a little bit tough . how tough was it for you to get back on the court after beating serena williams ?
what made it difficult mentally ? like when you say it was difficult mentally , what does that mean ?
do you think that you 're still handling it , or are you now settled for the rest of your tournament ? because you have a nice opportunity here to make a good run .
can you talk about kind of what your life has been like over the last 48 hours since beating serena ? take this match aside , but phone calls , interviews ? i mean , how much has life changed for you ?
have you heard about gulbis ' comments today about professional tennis players ? he said he hopes his two sisters wo n't become professional tennis players because women need to think about having kids and enjoy life . what is your opinion about these comments ?
what 's the sort of tennis background in your family ? am i right in thinking your brother played a little bit on the tour ?
did your parents play ?
your brothers ' names ?
is there a feeling in the locker room that the young girl is ready to take over the older players who have won a lot ? is there a feeling , okay , our time is coming finally ?
so do you get your mobile phone back , or does your coach keep it for the rest of the tournament ? what 's the deal ?
can you just talk about potentially your next match . i do n't think we know your opponent yet . mentally going into that match , what do you think ?
congratulations on your match . there is no doubt that the results are up to what you have achieved in australia . from australia to the french open , have you made great strides ? are you more powerful ?
on the court , you like dictating play , but outside the court , do you dictate play or not ?
in life , how are you in life ?
if you get a good result with suarez in the doubles , will this have an impact on your decision for the fed cup ?
an englishman asked you a question about your mobile phone . but have you heard about this situation in venezuela following your success ?
are you prepared to win the tournament ? because you are one of the favorites now .
the president of the tennis venezuelan federation has said to the government that the government should speed up things so that you continue along these lines . i mean , two countries are vying to get you .
so following the win against serena , is it true that you have n't read the newspapers , that you have n't watched the news ?
you 're going to play against mona barthel or pauline parmentier . which players you do n't want to play against ?
you are a player who might be one of the favorites for this tournament . do you have some pressure ?
how much better do you think you 're playing now than when you started this tournament ?
you played bouchard last year at the us open . what do you remember about that ? what about now ?
would you rather play her on clay or hard ?
there was a controversial situation in the middle of the second set where you seemed to be very quiet through the whole thing . how did you see that situation ?
hantuchova seemed to appeal to you to say that the point was stopped on your side of the court . did you think for a second that you should join in that discussion ?
did you sense that the audience shifted their preference of player afterwards ?
match seemed to be quite similar like the one against daniela in fed cup in bratislava . did you see to the same way ?
are you still looking at it as a good week , or too disappointed to look at it that way ?
you won a lot of matches over the last month . big step up in class today . did you really feel that early on in the match , that you 're playing someone at a different level ?
related to that , do you think the women 's tournament is wide open ? do you think she can win this event , and would it make you feel better if she did ?
just looking ahead , because we wo n't speak to you again after this , with laura kind of injured , whatever , you 're going to be the british no.1 going into the grass court season . without her , i guess there will be more focus on you probably . is that something that daunts you , or do your recent performances send you into the grass period believing you 'll be able to handle all that ?
are the mistakes today the result of the philosophy of attacking when you can , and are you going to continue in that vein ?
you said you did n't think there was a great deal of difference today . that must really encourage you when you see she 's no.4 in the world and you were right there with her .
you 've obviously done very well the last few months climbing back up the rankings . when you look at what halep has done in the last year she was no.57 in the world coming into this tournament does that give encouragement to you that anything is possible , in the women 's game in particular ?
you 've won a wta title and put together a lot of long winning streaks already in your career . is sort of taking down a really big name the next thing that you aspire to do ?
last year obviously in the grass season you were just coming back and you were n't fully fit . how much are you looking forward to having a chance to go into this in good form and fully fit ?
so you think second week of wimbledon could be a possibility for you ?
where do you go next ? nottingham ?
then birmingham , eastbourne ...
another very solid match for you here . things feel like they are coming together this week ? do you feel that you 're still moving forward ?
what is it about this place you like ? a lot of americans over the past recent generations have not always loved it here .
is there anything that 's different about the majors ? is it just the atmosphere ? does it pump you up more ? any sort of effect on you as opposed to the lesser tournaments ?
what 's feeling like at the moment in the changing rooms with the top two seeds gone , do the people who perhaps came here feeling they did n't have a chance feel they really now have a chance ? is it time to make a name ?
but do you think there is more pressure now because everyone , with the top two gone , there is more of a chance because logically it 's always going to be about serena , perhaps li na , but with them gone everyone really it 's open season for people who are left ?
on the tour and maybe in fed cup the results earlier this year were not the greatest , but things are sort of clicking here . what are your thoughts about that in terms of american tennis ?
american performance here at this tournament .
in general . yes , the general american performance at the french open this year .
do you talk to some of the other players , or do you just focus solely on your own path ?
you were at wimbledon last year when the draw sort of broke apart and things got crazy . did that sort of change your mindset at all when you were one of those last eight players and you knew that you were maybe one of the higherranked players left , even though your ranking was n't as high as normal , yet you were one of the higherranked ones left in the quarterfinals ? does it sort of all heighten things , that one experience , when you look back ?
when you talk about extra things happening with girls ?
paul had tweeted you might have a tougher practice after discussing his technological deficiencies . did he follow through on that ?
so you guys made up , that 's good .
a lot of players have routines at a tournament . do you have a place where you eat for dinner ? do you stick to the same thing ?
which is ?
do you get out much here and if so what things do you enjoy doing ?
long day for you , eh ?
how if any , being now the topranked american in the tournament now , have any effect on you , if any ?
how did you wind up playing doubles with lucicbaroni ?
you were n't planning on playing doubles here ?
just helping a sister out ?
was n't always straightforward today , but you got through .
must be pretty excited to still be in the tournament .
how much do you look at the draw ?
have you prepared for that atmosphere ? you 'll be on chatrier probably with 13,000 french people wanting you to fail .
how did you manage the interruption and the fact that you had to go back on court this morning ?
you showed that you were able to manage yourself emotionally .
you 're a very sensitive girl , and you 've been through some things for the last year . are you thinking now , let 's go for it and just relax ?
so you are trying to take things easily . do you want to make loc happy ?
small tournaments , 25,000 tournaments . it 's difficult . but maybe that helped you grow stronger , because you played many different matches .
with kristina mladenovic , two northern players qualified for the next round . how do you feel ?
what about leadership in the final draw ?
a lot of players have had problems in the past after they have a big win they sort of have a letdown the next match . how were you able to keep it going today ?
what is that feeling like you 're describing during today 's match ? were you thinking back to the li na match actually or thinking you 're already happy with the tournament ?
today .
yeah , what were you thinking about ?
how do you see the tournament now for you ? do you see it as an opportunity or do you see it as , well , i got two big wins and everything going forward is just bonus ? how do you see the tournament for you ?
is it difficult ? because , yes , you had the win against li na , you have this win , you 're in the third round of a slam , to stop yourself from saying , oh , you know , like i have done something , i have accomplished something , and to refocus for your next match ?
how pleased are you or surprised are you that you 've been able to perform so well at home ? because not everybody can do that . not just in france , but australia and , you know , the australians . are you surprised ?
how did you experience this match after this huge win against li na ? and then you had a physical problem during the second set . what was on your mind ?
you said nothing serious , but was it your back ? was it your thigh ?
confirming this victory , is this going to help you play petkovic ? will you think you have nothing to lose ?
the two last french girls are pauline and yourself from the north of france . what do you think about it ?
this is probably a stupid question , but why would you play much better this week than the last few weeks ? is it because you found this structure yannick has around you ?
you won in two sets . are you pleased ? because we know in the past you 've played a lot of threesetters . it was a bit easier this time today ?
what do you think about the conditions ? do you prefer playing in quick conditions when it 's sunny , or do you feel okay and you can adapt to those slow conditions like today ?
do you feel the draw now is more open since serena and li na are eliminated from the main draw ?
maybe a friend of yours , wozniacki , she 's having a hard time . she was out in the first round . do you sympathize with her situation ?
are you happy to go through after seeing the top two seeds out of the tournament ?
do you feel like you 're more mature today and maybe , i do n't know , a few years ago you might have lost the first set or you would 've needed three sets to go through ?
your next match is safarova . can you look ahead to that ? what are your thoughts on that ?
you 're still a young player , but when you see the new generation of players coming up , like garbine muguruza or taylor townsend , does it make you feel old a bit ?
svitolina is obviously one of the young ones who has been rocketing up the rankings . what do you think of her potential now that you 've played her a couple times ?
we were talking to petkovic earlier , and she was saying everyone is telling her li na is out of your section and you should advance to the semis , you know . in your case , a lot of people are saying now ana is one of the favorites . are people telling you these things and is it easy to block this ?
novak , we asked him to pick favorites , and obviously he said he 's rooting for you and jelena . he said maybe you have an edge because you won here before . do you feel this kind of confidence coming from the fact that you won here before ?
you 've pulled off two big upsets this year , both in australia with serena and then maria in rome . what 's the toughest part about the match after that match ?
just wanted to check with you , first of all , physically you must be doing well , because you played your first two matches very well , but i know you had that withdrawal in rome . are you 100 % ?
with the way the draw is , a lot of people see you as a favorite here , title contender . does that make you feel different about the tournament ? more pressure ?
do you feel like a lot of people see you as a favorite to contend for the title ? how does it feel to be in that position ?
changing the subject a little bit , i was curious to get your thoughts . when you score a big upset , like last year with radwanska or jelena jankovic or some of those big wins you got last year , and then you had to go play your next match , how hard is it to kind of approach the match after you scored a big upset ? what 's the hardest thing about it ?
camila , how you feel after today 's match ? i think you played very well , but how do you think ?
she played much better than you ?
if someone had said to you a week or so ago that in your first slam you 're going to last longer than no.1 serena or venus , what would you say ?
really challenging atmosphere out there on the court . you said you did a lot of visualizing . could you talk about that ?
just to follow up on that , where were you , they 're chanting her name and the wave and sort of drizzling ? you know , you got tentative . you had some big leads , you blew a bunch of match points . there was a lot of adversity you had to overcome . just talk about all of that .
can you tell us about your notebook ? you did a lot of reading today . what 's in it and how does it help you ?
a generalization .
what does this win means to you ? you know , you were no.1 in the world junior , lots of expectations . is it a relief that , okay , i can put it out , i 'm proving i can do it ?
there were a lot of nervous moments , at least on the scoreboard . up 41 , losing five straight games , and up 51 and pushing all the way to 54 , before closing it out . how did you keep sort of relatively calm enough to hang on as it was slipping away at the end there ?
zina is one of the people you work with . could you talk about what it 's like working with her ? is she more a tennis coach or a life guide ?
andy murray tweeted out today asking how good is taylor townsend . could you answer that question for andy , please ?
as someone once said , could you answer the question ?
how did it feel winning on the same court where just hours earlier serena had lost ?
seriously , you did n't know ?
obviously you made the decision that you wanted to go pro and take that opportunity when it was presented , but as the daughter of two people involved in education , i 'm wondering where are you standing with your high school ?
the daughter of a principal has to have a diploma ?
what was the little dance move there at the end ?
next match ? you 're still moving on here . suarez navarro , clay court lover . she gets a lot of balls back .
can you just talk a little bit about the wildcard that you got and how you got it by the agreement with the french and working towards it in the tournaments in the states as opposed to coming over here and obviously playing qualifying ?
that looked pretty clinical out there . everything go pretty much according to plan ?
cibulkova next . you 've got weapons that work well against her and have a very good record . does that fill you with confidence , or is there a danger that she 's now going to be out to get you sort of thing ?
this is probably a little bit bigger picture , but with serena going out your section of the draw that has blown a little bit further open . how do you feel about that ?
you looked really sharp and focused in the first set there . tell us about your mindset at the moment and how you feel about the week in general .
you mentioned cibulkova . i think you last played her a few weeks ago on clay courts . does that give you some sort of little mental boost , a mental edge ?
and how is the leg ? healing well ? no problems ?
you were talking to the umpire midway through the second set . you looked at him and , is that my warning or what ? what was that about ?
and you still do n't know ?
the conditions were n't easy today . tough first set and little by little you find the range ?
li na lost . serena lost too . what are your thoughts on the big surprises and consequences for the draw and everything ?
talking about a new generation . we have garbine upset serena and kristina ousted li na and we had townsend ousted cornet . well , are they really coming , the young girls , or just for the moment ?
more challenge or motivation of the new girls coming for you ?
you said you were in the middle , but you had been around for a long time .
i do n't mean that disrespectfully .
do any of the younger women coming through come to you to say , how did you cope when you came on the scene and you got a big win and then had to deal with a lot of pressure , a lot of expectation on you ? did they come and ask you , maria , how do i go about maximizing my potential ?
wawrinka and li say at some point the pressure was too big on them and they could n't handle it anymore . you have done this since a long time now . what 's your own way to deal with the expectations from outside ?
hi . are you disappointed to lose so early in the tournament ?
you 've had a good season , but it did n't click today . any explanation ?
congrats . what 's your feeling right now ?
what did serena say to you at the end of the match ?
how does it feel to be able to pull off this sort of win on what is , as i understand it , is not your best surface ?
was there a moment in the match where you suddenly realized you have a great chance here ?
some of the other younger players who have beaten serena this year have said when they stepped on the court , no , they did n't believe they could do it , and then they eventually did it . did you believe when you stepped on the court today ?
i do n't know if you checked that next opponent , but there will be another young up on the coming player you are going to be playing in the next round . do you feel like this tournament or this year is the time for you guys , your younger generation , to make a big achievement ?
the media guide says serena is your favorite player . is that true ? how do you prepare to play your favorite , the player you looked up to growing up ?
tennis is very strange . i saw you losing to kimiko date , leading 76 in the third , an incredible match . today you beat serena williams . how that can happen in your opinion ? how many people are courting you now to play for venezuela , for spain , they still talking about this ? have you decided ? have you taken a decision about it ?
depends on money , depends on ...
you said that you knew this time around against serena you just had to come out and do what you had to do . what was that ? what was your game plan tactically ?
did you ever surprise yourself how well you were playing and how well the match went ?
the big win at the australian open over caroline and before that you had the big win in hobart . i mean , talk about how much maybe the start of your season . did that kind of help reset and set your expectations and goals for this season ?
when and where did you begin tennis ? the other question is what other great achievements before today ?
who are the best venezuelan players that you remember ? do you remember jorge andrew ? nicols pereira , of course .
have you ever met them ?
when you were a kid , where were you looking on tv ? who was your idol ?
yes , before serena .
very different .
congratulations . obviously it 's a big victory . how can you go to sleep at night , this evening ?
to beat the player you so admired on center court in roland garros , you 're so young , is this a bit of a dream for you ?
not only did you beat serena , but you beat serena fast . i mean , this match barely took over an hour , 62 , 62. did you ever think at some point it was going to change and she might have , start a comeback , or were you just hoping you could keep your momentum going until the finish ?
can you just update on what your training situation is these days ? where do you train and base yourself ? is it still in spain or florida ?
you said clay is one of your favorite surface , but i think once you said you prefer like hard court or like a fast surface . so now do you think that clay is your favorite surface or it could be hard ?
you would be even more popular since today but where are you more popular right now , spain or venezuela ? i 'd like to know . and what do people ask you when they stop you ? do you have to sign autographs ? do you go free in some discotheque ?
not at all ?
you could play venus williams in the next round . you could . are you happy you wo n't play against her ?
you are happy you wo n't play against venus ? how well do you know schmiedlova ?
is schmiedlova a better opponent for you ?
where was your father born ?
was it the village of eibar ? because there are many villages in that province . more seriously , can you tell us what you 're feeling right now ?
so you were calm because you knew exactly what you had to do . what changed between australia and now ? what changed for yourself ?
the other day you said the key was to forget about the respect you have for serena .
what did you feel when serena said , keep up playing like this and you might win the tournament ?
you had excellent results this season , but in the past you were not that regular . why is that ?
serena had won 288 matches in grand slam . and you 're the first one defeating her . that must help you build your confidence .
you analyzed serena 's game before you walked on the court . did you know exactly how to play against her ? had you worked out a tactic , a strategy ?
is this your most beautiful day as a professional tennis player ? and second question , after this victory , do you think you will have a lot of pressure on your shoulders ? and do you know if you 'll play for spain or venezuela ?
you 're talking about october/november to make a decision ?
good evening . what about your feelings ? is there something you would like to talk about after the match ?
i think you were saying in strasbourg that you 're not yet used to playing these types of players at that level . but you 're getting close to them , i think .
what did you miss then on the court ? what is it that you did n't do that you should have done ?
can you tell us more about your practice . you practice with benoit gacon ?
( off microphone . )
during the first round , you said it took you time before you could gain confidence , it 's not natural . is that what you work on with makis .
what are you going to do next ?
it was a very unpredictable match , especially the last two sets . what are your thoughts on all the momentum changes ? obviously you had to think the way things were going that you still had a chance up until the end .
what is it that makes her game special , in your eyes ?
that was the worst situation playing a girl who plays extremely well . do you find you managed to play your tennis ?
this game at 54 , return on your forehand , you 'll have nightmares , i guess ?
what were you missing in your game ? your serve ?
so is everything collapsing ? are you frustrated ? are you sad ?
in terms of behavior , you were extremely calm . is this the positive thing for you about this match ?
is this a future great player ?
what changed after the first set ? you were like two different players almost .
were you worried after the first set ? and at the start of the second , was it already that you said , okay , i 'm going to be able to win this set , or it took a few games ?
did she surprise you a little bit in the beginning , especially that serve wide in the ad court ? were you expecting that ? obviously you seemed to get on to it after a while . at the beginning seemed pretty good for her .
when you say you were n't in the right mental frame of mind , what exactly does that mean ?
did you really have to go to the bathroom ?
you just reach the third round , and schmiedlova , she won against venus or center court today . muguruza is leading serena now . do you feel like the younger generation , it 's time for your generation to make some big achievement in this tournament ?
how would you characterize a game like this , 1 out of 10 in terms of your level of play ? obviously like a player has sometimes really , really good days and days where they 're struggling a little bit .
do you know what that big break at the beginning of the match was all about ? did anyone tell you anything ?
do you normally look ahead in the draw ? do you know what 's coming in the next round and a few rounds past that ?
can you maybe tell us one or two examples of how your popularity has changed in canada since australia ?
is it true you and your sister were named after prince andrew and sarah ferguson 's children ?
is there any connection with england or britain in your family ?
has your sister gained in popularity because of your success , your twin sister ?
did you follow the game between montral and new york yesterday ?
did you look at the results ?
i imagine you 're feeling much better . it 's like sunshine in a very difficult year . how did you experience this today ?
do you think that 's what made the difference , is you were aggressive and combative ?
the fact that kim was there in the corner , was that meaningful ?
did you talk to her before the match ? did she give you any advice , tips ?
you remember the last time that you had so much fun on the court ?
can you say something about your next opponent ? do you know who you 're going to play ?
she 's just played in the final in strasbourg . she 's spanish , so you think she 's a claycourt player ?
who do you play with in the doubles ?
she 's the one who defeated silvia solerespinosa . maybe she can help you .
a few days ago you expressed a few doubts regarding your selfconfidence . we did n't see any of that today . you seem to be very confident .
caroline has been no.1 ; you played her today . do you feel that in some compartments of her game she 's not as strong as she was when she was no.1 ? how would you tell ? is there anything the opponent can take advantage of in her game ?
everybody has personal problems . she had personal problems . it was tough for her . did you think about that before the match , that she was suffering ? is there anything you would like to say to her ?
well done . first slam main draw win since you were ill last year . does what mean something to you , or is that just a detail ?
obviously not .
have you ever done that before in a professional match ?
you still won the point .
you said the other day it 's fun playing more aggressively . did it feel that way today with the pressure going up with each match , grand slam first round ?
apart from the funny moment , you had a big smile on your face the whole time .
you held your concentration throughout , including when it could have been 41 ; turned out 32 when you were called for the net touch . were you aware of that at all ?
ever grand slam has a particularly different atmosphere . when you 're on a court like that , do you hear the saxophone and the accordion being played outside the court ?
obviously you 've had to play at a low level to get your ranking back up . are you surprised just how many matches you 've won this year ? it 's remarkable . you 're on a huge streak at the moment .
your next opponent is clearly one of the inform players at the moment . have you seen much of her ? and the way she 's played , what do you think of her progress this year especially ?
was she quite a tricky opponent today in the sense that she quite emotional ? she had the time violation . do you have to kind of be careful not get sucked into the drama on the far side ?
the british no.1 ranking is getting closer to you with every win . does that mean much to you , being the top brit ?
i guess you might play on chatrier or lenglen possibly , which you have n't done before . that would be exciting , i presume . you 've played on the big courts at the other slams .
will you continue with that same style , that same aggressive style that 's kept you going all the way through , or will you change that at all for the next round ?
pretty solid start here . big smile afterwards on court . you seemed pretty happy with that compared especially to the last few matches i 've seen you play . this looked better on all fronts .
just in the second set it was tight there ; did n't serve it out at 65 and the breaker was back and forth . you had a bunch of match points . what 's going through your head ?
how were the conditions out there to you ? a lot of players are saying because of the rain it 's kind of slow and sticky .
something click for you when you get to slam ? you 've talk about this before , but you 've had tough losses here and coming into other slams , too . you have n't lost in the first week of a slam in quite a while . how does that sort of switch happen ?
just talk in general about your feeling about clay court play . i mean , obviously the americans are n't noted for usually loving it .
how is the transition going for paul from coaching men to coaching a woman ?
does he ever say he has to change how he communicates with you ?
you guys were sharing a place at indian wells ? i ca n't remember now .
yeah .
right .
they often say that obviously the americans do n't do that well here on the clay . first round showing we have six women with three still to play , and i think i about four guys with one left . you see any reason for why it 's picking up for us or any surprise on your part on that ?
do you ever say to yourself , hey , it 's pretty cool having the same coach as sampras and federer ?
talk about your mom and what kind of degree did she get ? what did that mean to you ?
you look pretty proud .
take a minute and talk about the carson training center . have you worked there much at all in l.a. ?
talk about the dynamic there . is it a strong place to develop your game ? just reflect on that for a minute .
we 're doing a piece on it , that 's why .
yeah . but did it help your game ? i guess it helped your game . you enjoyed working there .
good having other americans around ?
paul was saying you 're such a perfectionist that one of the things he emphasized to you is putting struggle or bad shots behind you and moving on . that 's a key point or thing for you to adjust to . how would you talk about that .
there were so many expectations last year after the australian open . what do you think of those expectations in general , and how do you think things have gone for you ?
i wanted to go back to paul and his wifi issues . is it just that he 's not tech savvy ?
he 's old .
congratulations for your victory here . in the court you were mentally stronger than na li the third set . what is your opinion in general ?
any more expectations or sometimes you beat a great player and next round is normal or this is going to be a turning point ?
what was the atmosphere like for you on the court today with the crowd and everything ?
you were pretty emotional after the match . what does the victory mean to you personally and for your career ?
you have said this in english , i think , but could you give us more details . tell us why this victory was even more important now after the beginning of the season . what does it mean to beat na li today ?
in your career , where would you say this victory is ? would you say it 's one of the best matches you 've ever played or not ?
you were talking about points and rankings . now , how come ? there is such a big gap between your ranking and the way you play , your level .
you are now working with yannick hesse . this is a new cooperation . will he become your coach ? what 's going to happen ?
you started saying we have started working together a few weeks ago , a few months ago , but it was made public only 10 days ago , so when did it really start ?
back to this match . you have managed to save two set points during the first set . would it have been tougher had you lost the first set ?
according to you , what are the most important elements thanks to which you could defeat li na or you managed to do this today ?
during the match everybody saw that you were very dynamic , you had lots of confidence , and 30 minutes ago during li na 's press conference she said she did n't really feel good during the match with you . she did n't really know what was happening . in her heart , she was saying , i think it was a bit odd for her . did you feel this , as well , during the match ?
how did you manage to get ready for this tournament in terms of food and diet ? what are your best restaurants in paris , if you have any ?
did you underestimate her ?
does she have the best dropshot in the world ?
with you back in the top 10 and ana ivanovic now knocking on the door , is that motivating to see how well she 's doing ?
do you have memories of the 2008 semifinal against her and playing against her ? i think you did a photo shoot with the serbian flag in front of the eiffel tower .
you are going to play kurumi in the next round ; it 's going to be three slams in a row .
how did you see that matchup ?
last two times you played on hard court against her , and this time it 's going to be
yes . so how do you think it affects the match and the game plan ?
two things : first thing is what were the people doing in the corner of the court last night that was getting you so aggravated ? you went over to yell at them . what were they doing ?
the second question is do you think because the weather and the circumstances that you were never going to get to reveal your new dress that had been talked about since indian wells ?
finally you did , yeah .
what happened at 3all ? seemed the match ended very quickly . it was so close and then ...
that was a potentially tricky match that you were able to get through very , very easily , it looked like . talk about your performance today and what it feels like to come in here as kind of a favorite , i guess .
and then was there an issue with your shoulder at all or anything ? i saw you walk up and ask the umpire about something .
yesterday wawrinka lost and said , you know , it 's a new world to him . maybe you can relate a little bit . maybe you can explain what goes through your head the first time you come back to a grand slam as a grand slam champion and a big favorite and how the pressure changes like this .
how long did it take you to get accustomed to this new situation , to be a star and ...
being a former champion here , do you feel under more pressure when you come to roland garros than the other slams ?
how much confidence does that match you played against serena just last week , the other week , give you for this tournament ?
talking about your early success , when you go to a slam now and you start talking about match by match working your way through the draw , how are you mentally approaching slams differently than maybe you did , you know , six years ago ?
novak yesterday said that the court was not , center court , was not in the very best condition because of the heavy rain of the last days . how was it for you ? did you feel it was great again ?
do you pay attention at all to upsets , what upsets happen ? obviously this morning li na went out . we have seen upsets on the guys ' side as well . but generally does it have any effect on your tournament at all ? is it easy to ignore ?
is it a different feeling for you to be on chatrier to start the tournament as the no.4 seed ? it 's much different than maybe a year , even a year and a half ago ?
and very close to 6love , 6love . did you think you were going to do it ?
you 're playing britain 's heather watson next . i know you played her at the us open last year . what are your memories of that match ? i know you were n't massively happy with it .
how did you experience this match ? you seemed very nervous and very tense .
how did you feel right from the beginning when she won so many games ?
so concretely on the court you did n't feel anything ?
you were crying when you walked out of the court with a towel on your face . have you ever felt that bad on a court ?
at the end of the first set you went back inside , you came back on the court with a jacket on . were you trying to start from scratch ?
what 's the difference between the two first sets against sharapova two years ago and this match today ? is it because you had nothing to lose ?
you talked about pressure . how does it build up ? was everyone talking to you about roland garros ?
so everything was a bit mixed up ?
a few months ago you said roland garros is just a tournament like any tournament . maybe today you are aware it 's not the same thing ?
quick question : in the second set there was a game at 21 where you made a few errors and went down 31. there was another one at 43 and you went down 53. you stayed very mentally tough and came back quickly and won the second set . in the third set she had a letdown in the beginning . would you characterize this match as a match of two players of equal level , but one was mentally tougher than the other and therefore she won ?
found yourself down pretty quickly in the first set . talk about the comeback , and also what it was like to just play in your grand slam debut .
how do you feel about your progress just the last few weeks , last couple months ?
as far as milestones go , what does your first grand slam win mean , where does it rank ?
how nervous is nervous ? you said you were nervous at this beginning . give us a sense of what you felt like before you went out there , when you first got out there , in the warmup .
talk a little bit about working with zina and what she brings to the table for you , what the difference is , what you think that she 's given you .
a lot of tennis players talk about working on the mental side and improving mentally . when we think about tennis , you can do drills to improve a backhand , a forehand . what do you do get better mentally ?
pump up jam today , what were you listening to walking out there ? got ta know .
you talked about bonding and community . talk a little bit more about that . explain in a little bit more depth , what you went through or what that means to you specifically .
and when you tweeted out a little while ago , i think from florida , thank god i did n't go southside on that girl . what was that about ?
you get alize cornet next , the no.1 french woman , so on a big court here . what are your thoughts on that , playing a main draw match on one of these big stadiums ? what that 's going to be like ?
talk to any family yet ? mom ? anyone ? telephone ?
how did you settle on zina ? did she come to you or you to her ? obviously there is lots of coaches out there and you were down in florida at that point in time .
is there anything that 's unsettling about sometimes being in washington and sometimes in chicago , or you feel like both are home base enough ?
everything went according to plan or minor glitches ?
i would like to hear your feelings about the match . it was like pretty quick , but i would like to know how you felt on court and everything , please .
you had many free points on your serve today . i think after your first surgery you had to change your motion on the serve . did you change anything after this injury last year ?
some of men 's players have been talking about the debate that 's happening , playing best of three or best of five at slams . they said best of five is what makes it special at grand slams , it 's different . obviously women play best of three everywhere . what is it that makes it special here ? it 's probably an obvious answer .
each time you are in paris , you enjoy eating macarons .
when you win , how many of them do you allow yourself to eat ? and when you lose do you get to eat more as a consolation prize or is it the other way , do you punish yourself and have a bit less ?
looking for an eventual quarterfinals match against serena , have you given any thoughts about i know your next match is your only concern , but ...
because it will be a really blockbuster match . well , have you given any thoughts about that match ?
you have been around long enough through ups and downs and injuries . so when you see someone like venus still out there competing , considering her condition , is that something that you look to for inspiration or bewilderment ? she 's certainly earned the right to retire .
a few weeks ago tennis came together to mourn the passing of bally due to liver cancer . some said that it may have been associated that she was born near chernobyl . could you talk about the aftereffects of the incident at chernobyl ? is there still impact in terms of ill health in terms of cancer and so forth ? could you reflect on that , please .
how , if at all , does it feel different for when you come to a grand slam tournament when you had won the year before , coming back as a defending champion ? is there any different feeling you have in a positive or a negative way coming back ? and can you remember specifically back to the first time you went back to wimbledon , having won it the year before ?
going back a couple of months , what was it like being one of the final torch bearers at the opening ceremonies ? what do you think the image of sochi was after the olympics ?
tennis is played on obviously several different surfaces . how would you rank the surfaces you 're best on ? what are your best surfaces ?
you have had a lot of incredible comebacks and triumphs , but it is your work on clay , does that give you some of the most pride you have in your career ?
you looked pretty good today , obviously . what were you happy with about your game and what , if anything , was something you were unhappy about ?
this is apart from tennis you are also a businesswoman . why did you decide to invest your money in something like sweets , sugarpova and so on . it 's difficult to find someplace to invest your money or it 's a good idea to make a sweet ?
last week in strasbourg , alize cornet said she was extremely upset about being booed by the french fans . have you had experience with that ?
she said she was upset about being booed by the fans at her firstround loss . i wondered whether you had had experiences of that in the past by the french fans ?
do you think that sometimes the french fans get behind the male players like tsonga and monfils more than , say , the leading french female players ?
do you feel that the public , the french fans , they sometimes get behind the players like tsonga and monfils , the top male players , say , than the top female players ?
back to today 's match , the first set was very close between the two of you ; the second set was more difficult . can you explain the fact that the second set was more difficult for you ?
what was your injury exactly ?
the second set , in the end she neutralized you , as you say . was that also due to the fact that you were lacking physical condition . you were not in very good shape ?
how did you hurt your rib ? during a match ?
roland garros , you do n't have that many roland garros tournaments to play . are you going to try to enjoy every minute ?
yes , but when you walk on court here ...
i just wanted to ask you , how have you found it throughout your career dealing with the crowd at roland garros ?
have you ever found in the past that the crowd has been against you and has that been difficult to deal with ?
not today but in the past .
what about a french crowd ? because , for example , last week alize cornet was competing in strasbourg and the french crowd started to boo her . have you ever had a situation like that at all ?
a general question . could you make the difference of one set , 31 for vinci and then after the second set and then the match for you , you know , the two parts , if you see what i mean ?
finally , with the first stop and the rain and when you were back on the courts after the rain , you were more aggressive , you came more to the net . was that a change even though it was not the main turnaround ?
is it a special win ? because this year i think you have not won any matches on the wta tour . it 's the third top20 player that you 've defeated in your career . what about this ?
and by the way , could you tell us exactly what you 've changed in your tactics apart from moving more into the courts ? it 's too simple ?
first match here . always difficult against an opponent you do n't know . how did you feel on the court ?
good first set , 61. after that , a little down .
happy to take five games and finish ?
that refocus , is that something that you feel like martina has helped you with as you have worked with her more and more , or what has she brought to your game specifically ?
along those same lines , would you say that martina is a tough coach or is she hard on you or is she nice and friendly after the match is over ?
i 'm curious , for somebody who obviously likes grass as much as you do , how do you feel about red clay , especially wet red clay ?
next round is against someone you know , mona barthel . how do you feel about that ?
what did martina say about your match today ?
i just spoke to marina before , and she said you played her in cincinnati i think recently and had a very tough threeset match . really looking forward to playing her again . can you give me your thoughts on her , looking forward to that game . and congratulations on your win .
you had some success on the clay here at roland garros , semifinalist . clearly you still prefer the hard courts and obviously the grass .
are you happy with your preparation , the way you 're playing at the moment ? happy with your performance today ?
first grand slam ; first press conference . how did you feel on the court ? in the second set you were leading 41 ; is you played better . you did n't have the best possible draw .
you were not scared of losing the match at 4love , 61 ?
clearly , yes , it was your serve that was not good enough today .
unbelievable experience , this first roland garros with the grown ups . are you going to learn something ? how did it go in the draw when you found out who you were going to play ? how did you feel before the match ?
you do n't talk about match , you talk about fight . is that because you 're a warrior ?
because during the whole match you encourage yourself , you would hit your thigh and you did n't give up . maybe some other players would 've given up . you never gave up .
do you have any regrets ?
the fact that you did n't win the second set , do you have any regrets about that ?
you 're not as shy as you used to be during press conferences .
i 'd like to ask you about the relationship between the french players and the french crowd . i know it can be quite variable at times , sometimes it can be difficult . do you feel they are maybe more demanding of the french players than foreign players ?
they expect so , so much .
do you feel that the crowd sometimes tend to get behind the french male players a little bit more than the female players ?
when , for example , like last week in strasbourg the crowd being not quite so nice , how do you deal with that ?
how do you feel after this first victory as french no.1 here in paris ?
how does it feel winning in 58 minutes ?
but it 's also very important for the rest , because your objective is week 2 , so you want to save energy . do you have this in mind when you walk on the court ?
i just wanted to know what you thought about this dancing battle between monfils and lokoli , who won . and why did n't you take part in that battle ?
laurent overdid it . he was dancing , making the show , gave a press conference before his match today . you were successful when you were young . what do you think about it ? is n't it dangerous ?
the first set was difficult because virginie played well , and she served at 45. what was your feeling at this time , especially ?
how was the turnaround from playing in nuremberg just a couple of days ago ?
was there much of an adjustment to make for here ? obviously with the weather today , maybe you could n't tell .
what is your confidence level right now ?
everybody remembers you in montreal for obviously the big run you had in australia . and do you expect to have such another good run at this tournament ?
looking back , do you think a lot about what happened in australia or for you it 's like the past and you do n't really revisit that too much ?
you have played a lot on the clay with portugal and last week , in addition to the two big ones . how much do you think you have learnt in those four weeks of how to play on european clay and how much more confident do you feel on it now ?
i can not ignore the hello kitty stuffed animal . could you talk about the story behind that ? and what is next to the hello kitty stuffed animal ?
did you get that one from genie army ?
you 're always critical of yourself . what would you be critical of today , even though it was a fairly clearcut win ?
we have been talking about your fans . how hard is it for you as a 20yearold to deal with that , to feel that huge increase of popularity over the last 12 months ?
so far it did n't bring more pressure to you ?
for the last few weeks in montreal in the sporting scene it was pretty much all of the canadiens because of the playoffs , now they are in a bad spot , one game away from elimination . did you follow a little bit hockey ? but most importantly , do you feel like now it 's time for you to get ...
well , i would n't phrase it like that , but if you do , yeah .
now is it your turn ?
you accomplished a fair bit , but the one thing you had n't done was win a tournament . there are a lot of tournaments ranked lower than you who have . were you starting to wonder when it was going to come ? not just because of what other people might think , but just because of yourself , for you wanting to do it . were you starting to wonder when it was going to happen ? you 're not playing that many small tournaments anymore , either .
did it make a difference that your coach arrived in time for the end of that week as opposed to the whole long stretch that you went through with him on the phone ?
the three losses you had going into nuremberg were all to pretty good players . did you feel you really were n't playing well at all or did you feel it was a bit of bad luck to play three players that were that good at those events ?
could you talk a little bit more about the dilemma you had to playing nuremberg ? did you decide at the last minute to stay in that tournament or it was more like if i need it i 'm going to play it , but the first plan was not really to play it ?
did you kind of not want to play it and then your coach said , you know , trying to incite you , oh , try to do it ?
he wanted you to go in paris ?
in talking about last week , calling your match against shvedova last week , was that a really important win because of what you and nick were talking about when you came off the court after the first set you were n't feeling physically great , you did n't feel you were playing particularly well . yet you gut stabbed the win particular when you quite someway down in the second set .
there is a question from the fans on roland garros.com . they are asking if you can speak french and can you speak french with a french accent ?
can you speak with an accent from quebec ?
i know that 's not what you hoped for . where did you feel it all sort of got away from you ?
was the serve what disappointed you the most ?
how did you feel about your movement on the clay and progress from last year to this year ?
you were obviously playing france 's no.1 woman on center court with a parochial crowd . did you feel any nerves out there ?
anything particular you 're working on with jason to sort of get to the next level ? you 've played main draw in a few slams now . anything in particular you need to do to make that next step ? obviously you 've got time on your side .
when you go into these sort of matches , do you go in expecting to win , hoping to win , or just trying to get experience ?
is it ever hard when your doubles are so far ahead of your singles in terms of sort of rankings to sort of reconcile ?
how are you feeling about doubles for this fortnight ?
congratulations .
it 's been a long road back for you to this point , to winning matches in grand slams again . talk about what the sort of journey has been like to get here .
injuries and everything the last three years or so .
short version .
in the first set , it was a little bit difficult , first eight games . what was the cause of that ? was it the slow court ? was it a little bit nerves ? first round ? what 's your opinion about that ?
i know you like faster courts better . on the slow surface and looking at the weather forecast this week , a little bit rainy , a little bit slower , is it something you go out and practice a little bit on , or can you do something in your game to make you feel more comfortable on the slow , wet clay ?
how do you change your game when it 's slower ?
a lot of people were enjoying your dress . i know you wore it in rome , too . any reactions you 've gotten to it so far ?
do you consider you as one of the favorites or one outsider ?
what are your thoughts on your section of the draw , if you 've looked at it ? there is a few interesting lower seeds there , but none of the big players who have done really well at this tournament in the past . so maybe some opportunities ?
of some of the young players that have been coming up and doing well this year , who , in your mind , sticks out as someone really to watch ?
what do you like about her game ?
last year you have good sensation here , more good than usually ?
sorry for my english . last year you were in quarterfinal , and you feel better for the first time in your life at the french ?
i know you 're pretty friendly with serena now through mouratoglou . what were your thoughts when you drew her and actually having to play her in a big stage match ?
did you talk at all after you found out you were playing each other or did it sort of go silent after a while ?
what is your relationship with her ? how close are you ?
overall , how do you think it went ?
yeah , the whole experience .
did you enjoy this match , this first match , on the center court ?
you know her well . how was she today ? do you think she was stronger than usual ?
can you imagine any other player capable of defeating her ?
when playing this kind of match , do you feel you 'll be defeated 6love , 6love and it 's going to be a nightmare ? did you have this fear before you walked on to the court ?
playing no.1 , certainly your head was spinning yesterday night . you probably had difficulties sleeping .
your family was there ?
are you going to watch the match again on video and analyze it , or will you take enough time before you do that ?
did you learn a lot from serena today ?
what a great match . strong emotions , i guess , and then 52 , 54 you were close .
what would you say you lacked in order to win this match ?
well , you 've progressed quite a lot between the end of last year and the beginning of this year . you said this yourself . you said you climbed up a step .
do you often make your dad cry ?
and for you there were tears , disappointment , but not just that , i guess .
you 've been working with your dad again for the last few months . why this choice ? is it easier for you to choose your dad as a coach ? it was the case in the past , and then you had professional coaches .
mladenovic , you know her and you 've played with her .
and now about the match : did you expect to have the right level to play a girl who 's number 40 in the world ?
talking about christina again , is it a way for you to find motivation ?
do you have one objective for this season ?
i guess that 's quite rewarding . nice victory . everything went fine . first round . so quite a lot of confidence ?
you 're going to play hantuchova in the second round . do you know her ? do you know how to play her ?
what about your game , your level ? you had a beautiful game in strasbourg .
in strasbourg you missed the quarterfinals , but it was pretty close . it would have been your first quarterfinal . did you think about it afterwards or move on ?
you won a tournament recently . with this first round , you 'll achieve the best ranking in your career so far . would you say you 're playing your best tennis at the moment ?
it seems it was good for you to join the fed cup team ; is that right ? did you improve because you had discussions with amlie ?
did you feel nervous at all before the match today ?
were you a little bit intimidated by venus ' reputation , or did it help that you had actually played her before ?
were you a little bit intimidated by her reputation or did it help you played her before ?
what do you think the turning point in the match was for you ?
when venus was your age , teenagers were winning grand slams . that 's not the case anymore . why do you think that has changed ?
you won juniors here last year . within the past year , how do you feel you have changed the most and what kind of things have you learned ? how different is it for you coming , when you came to this tournament this time around ?
how do you feel you have matured the most or changed the most within the past year ?
do you still speak to martina much ? did she give you any tips about how to battle the clay and maybe how to prepare for playing venus again ?
what sort of things did she say ? what sort of tips did she give you about how to prepare for the clay ?
i guess you had a great start . 52. everything was looking great .
where did it go wrong ?
does this match give you encouragement for the next time you face her ? do you think this is a step in a right direction ?
you stopped the ball at 65. there could have been a tiebreak and you asked for hawkeye . did you see it clearly out ?
you chose not to have carlos come out today .
is there any point where you were thinking , maybe i should have signed up to have carlos ?
is she a player that you just ca n't ever feel like you 're in control of even if you have a lead ?
you seemed happy with your match . is serena the kind of player that it does n't really matter what the other person is doing , that it 's what serena is doing ?
you played phenomenally well to start , and then all of a sudden she seemed to wake up almost . does it matter how good you play or does it matter how she plays when you play her ?
now that you 're no.2 in the world , do you feel like if you 're playing your best and serena is playing her best that you could still beat her ?
you hit some great serves wide to her on the forehand in big points , and she hit phenomenal returns for winners crosscourt . did that surprise you when she did that , or were you expecting her to come up with those ?
this was obviously your first final here in miami . you said this week that you want to be back here many times in the final . when you were up two breaks in the first set , first time final in miami , how did that make you feel when you saw the scoreboard and you were up two breaks ?
in that first set , particularly when you were playing very well , it was n't just serena making mistakes . it was you taking the match to her and hitting winners yourself . was that a conscious thing beforehand , you were going to take the match to her and be aggressive ?
you two were laughing a lot during the trophy ceremony . what were you talking about ?
you do n't feel so old out there when you 're both up there with the trophies , do you ?
do you feel like serena has this gift , that she can be playing so poorly , and then suddenly ( snapping fingers ) the light goes on and she could just turn into super serena again ? do you feel she 's able to do that ?
she served not her best today , 44 % first serves , only had a couple aces . maybe that 's because of where you were positioning yourself . do you feel you missed an opportunity a little bit ? because days when she 's serving so well , it 's really hard to get at her .
you call yourself an old lady , but still you seem to be learning about the game . it seems like your enthusiasm is someone who is 21 or 22 years old . is that a correct impression ?
expectations for clay ?
are you excited for clay ?
what are your goals this year ? it 's been a better surface for you . you played well in rome and obviously the french open .
how much confidence are you going to take from this week , your first final in miami ? how much confidence will you take now pushing off to the clay season ?
which do you think is the most important title , indian wells or miami , to the players ?
maybe even to you . i do n't know .
i understand you were staying in a downtown hotel , and i want to know if you were bothered by the music . did it affect how you were sleeping or preparing for the match ?
did you think about joining them ?
do you know what it 's called ? do you know what the music festival is called ?
ultra .
when you 're playing at your best , do you feel like you ever had or still do have a rival in this sport when you 're playing at your best ?
do you feel like one of your main strengths is your ability , when you 're kind of like not playing well , to just turn it on like that ( snapping fingers ) ? is that one of your strengths ?
you 're down 14 , what are you thinking ?
she plays pretty methodically . you seemed to be deliberating your pace between points too today , back to the net sometimes . was that a conscious decision , or ...
with your back to the net , sort of gathering yourself . what was going on there ?
and did that help ?
it 's called a rivalry , serena and maria , because it 's always , when you guys play , there is a lot of fan interest . but as maria pointed out at the beginning of the week , she says it 's not really a rivalry , `` because i have n't beaten her in 14 times . '' now it 's 15 or whatever . can you talk about the relationship between you guys ? why is it , even though you have completely dominated on the scores , why is it still an interesting matchup , do you think ?
do you consider , when you 've beaten someone 14 times in a row and 14 out of 16 , 15 now , do you still consider that a rivalry ?
do you think there was anything she did particularly well at the beginning when she was leading or maybe something different ?
i wanted to ask you , in the last years we had like the same players in the top 10 , but from last year , since may until now , the rise of simona halep , she rise from 67 until now she 's 5th in the world . if you can tell me , please , your opinion about her game and what chances do you give her to rise even more or maybe win in the future a grand slam ?
what 's the challenge like returning when you have someone like maria , so deliberate or sometimes really long gaps between the first and second serve ? what 's the challenge being a good returner against that kind of pace ?
i want to ask about the record . i think you break agassi 's record here with the most titles if you win the next one . do you think about being the alltime winner at this tournament ?
do you feel like having won , you know , 14 in a row , going into this , puts more pressure on you ? do you feel that she can have nothing to lose at this stage of her career when she 's someone who has won so much ?
you think you have nothing to lose against her ?
do you feel like when you 're not playing at your best that the one thing you always have in your bag is your serve and that could get you going ? is that what kind of happened today ?
34 game , break point against you , went for a huge second serve , and i do n't think you lost a point on serve in the rest of the set . can you feel the serve click in on one serve or is it just getting loose ?
have you gotten any comments from the dolphins on the dress or the dolphins fans or players ?
you had some pretty harsh words for yourself earlier in the week about how you were playing . how do you feel now ?
your thoughts on li or cibulkova ?
you 've always done so well here in miami . what 's the key to you feeling so comfortable here ? what is it that makes you feel so good ?
do you drive from palm beach gardens every day , or do you have a place here ?
some of the men players have said when they have been no.1 and they have really dominated the game that when they go out and play a match that they feel like that no.1 ranking wins them a couple of free points here and there . when you 're in these sort of situations , do you have that in mind ? do you feel that could be the case ?
do you wish you had a rival like evert/navratilova , agassi/sampras ? do you wish you had someone like that to really test you on a regular basis ?
would you reveal who you think is the biggest threat to your supremacy ?
was justine henin your toughest foe ?
you had a good start , obviously . how do you think things turned there in the first ?
was the wind a factor for you ?
would you say the biggest difference between you two is her serve ? is that just the thing that really is the most difficult ?
you 're very deliberate between serves . when you take your time that way , are you thinking about anything or are you just kind of washing your mind clean ? what 's going on ?
she was pretty methodical today . did you find yourself waiting for her at times to get the point started ?
they seemed normal to you ?
you obviously have n't beaten her in a while . does that make you feel at all like you have nothing to lose , or is that possible to have that feeling when you 're someone who has won as much as you have ?
do you put more or less pressure on yourself because of the past results ?
after a match like this , how close or how far away do you feel like you are against her ?
do you feel like sometimes serena just kind of relaxes out there , and then maybe you get a nice good lead , and then she 's able to turn it on , like flip that switch , take it up several levels more so than other opponents you 've ever played ?
what would you most likely be able to do to turn this around ? is there any area you just need to be better at to be winning these matches ?
if you had to pick a percentage of how you played compared to your best or how she played compared to her best , what would you say was your performance today on court ?
percentage .
coming up on clay , it 's been your best surface the last few years , do you feel like it 's your best surface now ?
obviously very disappointing , i 'm sure you are , especially with the four match points in the second set . what was it like to think you had the match won on that return of serve , and then the challenge system changes everything ?
did it kind of sap your spirit a little bit after the second set going into the third ? because it looked like you had it .
i imagine the wind was just crazy out there . nobody was holding serve . there were like 19 service breaks . was that mostly because of the wind , you think , or the return of serves were n't very good ?
would you say it was an advantage to return today ?
she reached the australian open finals . i know she beat you , i guess , in the semi , i believe . do you feel her confidence level is at an alltime high ? do you sense she 's a confident player right now ?
your court sense and your movement , you 're just everywhere . have you worked on that ? is that something that you saw early in your game , or is this something that 's just naturally come to you and you 've honed your game to that ?
but , i mean , you can run a lot but not get to the right spot and , you know , overshoot the ball . i 'm talking about something that looks quite mysterious to me , you know , like how you can just be so consistently there , like your anticipation is so keen .
did that one point kind of sum up the match , you did that like behindtheback shot ? she won the point on the let cord pass ? does that kind of sum it up for you today ?
you had one of those points here last year , too .
another win ?
winning a lot lately ?
feel good ?
it 's pretty hard to beat a wall .
how are you able to beat a wall ?
are you getting fed up with seeing dominika cibulkova across the net ?
but you have seen her across the net in so many matches this year .
different , but does it always feel a little special when it is someone you played before in a grand slam ? like before , when it was schiavone maybe you played again , does it feel special when you play them again ?
what do you remember most about the australian open final ?
putting australia to one side , will your mind be on what happened at indian wells , then ?
after the match they said you were the first chinese woman to make the semifinals here .
do you get tired of hearing you 're the first chinese woman to do things ?
well , you must be really , really happy about what happened today outside and your first move into the top 10 ?
does it feel like this is a big relief for you ?
you do n't know if it wo n't change , though ? it really could change .
do you feel like you belong there ?
there were 19 i think breaks of serve , and then in the third set it started to kind of even out .
was that due to the weather ?
you were married recently , right ?
okay . that 's good . bad question . thank you .
that turned into a pretty solid win for you . how do you think it sort of shifted midway through the first ?
people talk about her as being a player when she plays her absolute best she can hit pretty much anybody on tour off the court .
would you agree with that ?
what 's your prematch routine like ? do you eat the same food ? listen to the same music ?
is there a musical taste that you stick to during that time ?
when did you find out that you got the momentum back again to win the second set ? you just started and flew . what happened ?
you have serena next . obviously you have played quite a few times . what are your thoughts on chapter 15 and 16 of that ?
sort of a trial and error type thing , have you done something that has worked in the past ?
do you get the sense that she plays you differently than she plays other opponents ?
question about the pretty/tough thing and strong is beautiful campaign . what do you think the balance is with wta players between promoting them as athletes and promoting them in a way , marketing them in a way that they know can sell too , the kind of glamour side of tennis ? how does that balance seem to you ?
when you see a young player like genie bouchard getting a lot of attention not only for tennis but also on the looks side , does someone like that ever seek you out for advice about how to navigate that whole world of sort of extra publicity ?
does it feel like 10 years since that 's happened to you ? ten years ago you won wimbledon . does it feel like that long ?
what were some of those good decisions early on that i guess set you up to succeed later ?
knowing what you know now , would you have any advice for yourself ten years ago ?
you seemed happier with your performance out there today ; is that fair ?
what were you able to do to stop the skid , i guess ?
can you talk a little bit about the conversation you had at the end of the match , because she said you asked her to play doubles . she was very excited about that . she was very excited .
are you still looking to add the mixed ? french is coming up .
what is it that you saw in coco 's game that prompted you to ask her to play doubles , besides the huge serve ?
you relatively have n't gotten to play many of the younger americans . you have n't played madison or alison riske or taylor townsend or some of the others coming up . do you look forward to those , or do you not like it ?
your next match is against angelique kerber . totally different opponent . what do you expect ?
i do n't know if you saw any of sloane 's match last night , but she had sort of a rough go of it , 1 and 0. had a tough time finding a way to do well when she was n't playing her best , which is something you have gotten good at in your career . how does that work ? how do you still learn to still win when you 're not at your best ?
were you already asked about coco said that you mentioned to her at the net about playing doubles .
what did you see in her game that you 'd like to play doubles with her ? i 'll read the transcript . someone asked some good questions ( laughter . ) how about the rain delay ? were you asked about that ?
did that bother you much at all ? did n't seem to .
when you 're in a little bit of a funk like the first two matches , do you pull yourself out of the funk on or off court ?
how does it feel to feel like you ca n't do worse ...
venus , she 's been really playing well this year and playing well this here . can you talk about how nice it is to have your sister seeing some success .
steffi graf used to always play first matches , she liked playing early ; maria was in here and she was saying she liked playing at 11:00 , especially with the rain coming in . do you have a preference for time of day you like to play ?
night matches , day matches ? preference ?
last three times you played angelique was in faster conditions , cincinnati and indoors . do you think it will make a difference tomorrow ?
going back to the funk , does your mood affect your tennis or does your tennis affect your mood or both ?
do you feel like you 're in a good mood now ?
they had a video the other night . pretty or tough . they were asking the fans if they think maria sharapova is pretty or tough , and then they asked her what she thought she was . do you think of yourself as pretty or tough ?
seems like these days athletes can be pretty and tough .
how do you approach a match mentally when you 're a qualifier and you 're going up against the no.1 player in the world ? do you dream of stunning the world , or ...
you had a very good month in indian wells and here . what do you think has been the key to that ?
talk about the training . were you doing things markedly different than before in your career ?
he used the word to show your coconess or something during one of your ... what 's that mean ?
the second set serena upped her level , it seemed , at the end . what did you feel at that point ? what were you thinking at that point ?
so what are you happy with at the end of the day here ?
have you ever played as late as you did the other night ?
did it take anything out of you playing that late ?
how did you find maciej ? how did things wrap up with jan michael gambill ?
what did serena say to you after the match ? seemed like ...
are you going to try to make good on that ?
have you ever played tennis or basketball against kiki ?
who won ?
what do you make of serena as sort of a player , person ?
how much connection i guess do the younger american girls have to her ? is there any communication there , or is it more from afar ?
where do you think you 'll play doubles ?
was it your serve ? was it a long conversation ?
11:00 a.m. a little too early for you ?
was her game throwing you off at all ? you obviously played her before so you knew what you were getting into . lack of pace ? was that part of it ?
so what do you do ? go back to basics ? tell yourself to go back to basics ? what was sven telling you ?
in general , how much do you think people should read into the sort of oncourt coaching visits and how results after them someone gets a visit and they win three straight games might give all the credit to the coach or something ?
did the heat and humidity bother you at all ? i saw you eating a banana .
when you reflect on your record here , how do you assess it ? five finals obviously is a terrific achievement . does that overshadow any frustration about not winning the final here ?
do you feel there is a little unfinished business here ? you come back with that in your mind , or is that not part of the equation ?
do you feel fortunate you 're able to get your match in before this weather ?
percentagewise coming back from injury , where do you feel like you are right now ?
thinking back to the match in australia , 3 hours , 108 degree heat , what really motivates you ? it could be said you do n't need to put yourself through that . what is it that 's motivating you ?
yeah , generally to play tennis at this level and the work that goes into it .
what do you do with the rest of your day when you 're done so early and you 're in miami ? a lot of options .
i have heard you say that before , not being good in any other sports . do you think you 're not a natural athlete ?
do you think if you gave it the same sort of dedication you gave to tennis you might have gotten better ?
do you find all the like modeling and extracurricular stuff , the other stuff that 's nontennis , is that not fulfilling enough ? is tennis really what fulfills you more than the pretty magazine shoots and that kind of stuff ? would you able to be fulfilled just doing that ?
you 're playing ivanovic or kvitova . what do you expect from your next match ?
on the subject of other sports , do you follow the basketball tournament ?
that 's the one .
are you just not a basketball fan ?
did you watch grigor 's match last night ? kind of a heartwarming moment last night . did you happen to see that ?
the ball girl , he helped her to the side after she was feeling faint .
a lot of people were thinking that was fantastic .
kvitova and you have had long matches , including wimbledon , and a long australian open semifinal after that . what do you make of a rivalry with her ?
your fashion sense , what went into the yellow and the grays you 're wearing in this tournament ? was that kind of springtime , miami ?
pretty good match today ?
how are you feeling ?
did you see the end of the radwanska second set where she broke the racquet ?
she smashed the racquet .
what was it like being on the smaller court today ?
and also like a bunch of the women 's matches today were not on tv . there were no cameras for your match or for a few of the other matches on that court , but all the men 's matches were on tv . what do you think about that ?
any difference from playing here than when you won in australia ?
do you prefer to play at night ? because last day you played day and the match was so difficult , but tonight ...
next opponent is either wozniacki or lepchenko .
what do you remember about that match against wozniacki in australia , the semifinal ?
so you 're not usually straight into press . this was a fairly easy night for you ; fair to say ?
is it sometimes hard to stay focused when you know that somebody may not be playing up to their potential ?
at what point in the match did you sort of feel like it was going your way ?
after you had a start like you did and your dad comes out to talk to you usually we see the coaching when someone is in trouble , but you were n't in trouble at that point . what does he say to you then ?
that helps you to stay focused ?
what do you make of her as a player ? you have played her a few times . she can be a player who runs hot and cold , be hitting casual winners , and goes off the rails . what do you make of where she 's at right now ?
how good does it feel for you to be on the other side of that , after the jankovic loss , to be on the opposite side of that ?
was there any point in the match like that where you feel even a tiny bit sorry for the other person ?
you have quite a different look now as opposed to the stella looks . do you like the all black ?
do you have plans for tonight ?
it was a fast match . is your cooldown routine any different ?
not a short one today , but you got through it in the end .
you finished very strong , venus . all things considered , health issues and stuff , you must be pretty proud or happy with that .
you have only lost three matches coming into here , all of them really tight . how well do you feel you 're playing looking over the whole long span ?
if someone told you at age 21 that you 'd be here today in this match grinding it out , what would you have thought ?
would you be surprised you 're still out there doing this or ...
between the second and third set , there was a long break there . can you just talk about what were you thinking about during that time and getting ready for the third set ?
changed ?
you did change your dress , i noticed .
was that just for looks or just for ...
you touched on it a little the other day , but with each win you get , how much confidence you have and how much you 're enjoying this run .
at this stage , do you still work on your game ? do you still think things like my serve mechanics are a little bit funky ? i better practice for that , or is it just practice ?
the overall level of competition in the women 's tour , how do you think it compares to when you first broke through like 2000 , 2001 ?
why do you think that 's changed ?
you two obviously , like you said , raised the bar and level of the game . even though you 're not 1 and 2 in the world , you and serena , do you still feel like you 're like one of the hunted in some ways ? people still see you as a huge person to beat ?
your next match is cibulkova . can you talk about that matchup .
have you watched serena here ?
she 's had a few touches matches so far .
have you ever had that feeling , like i 'm supposed to lose , my arm is loose ?
in miami , how do you see the fans ?
you have an exceptional record at wimbledon . how much fuel does that give you to keep going , to sort of get back there ?
yeah .
any difference for you between singles and doubles for the olympics ?
gold is gold ?
have you ever thought about the winter olympics ? maybe you could bobsled or something . ( smiling ) .
it would have to be a big sled , too .
none of those sports are for you ?
when you look back as to what you have been through over the last couple of years , the time you spent away from the court , training and practice and all that , how much have you adjusted that ? do you do as much as you used to ? have you had to reschedule it and cut it down ? what is the situation ?
why do you think it 's important for you to keep secrets at this stage of your career ?
is there sort of like a competitive advantage almost ? like a formula ?
obviously tonight was a tough night . anything other than just things were n't firing for you tenniswise ? anything psychological ?
throughout that whole match were you thinking of , hey , this next point is where i 'm going to be able to find the rhythm ?
always nice to have the crowd on your side , but does it put a little extra pressure on you to play in front of a home crowd ?
have you felt this coming ? problems in practice or anything ? i know you said during warmups you kind of get settled down or something . that just not happen today ?
what do you try to adjust or change something ?
are there days that are so bad that they are almost easier to get over than , you know , something kind of in the middle range ?
do you feel caroline was a bad matchup for you ?
did you feel that it was going to be a bad night from the very start ? was there a point early in the match where you thought it was n't happening ?
do you go back out tomorrow and/or do you take a day ?
retail therapy ?
there were some harsh words on tennis channel saying they were not sure if you were trying to act cool or if you did n't care tonight during the match . what would you say in response to that ?
not a bad match . obviously you got through a scary part of the first set . how important were those big points ?
is it easy for you to learn how to stop thinking ? is that easy ?
you were once a player like her , coming up , new , young . life is complicated for a young person sometimes . do you sympathize with her and what she 's going through , trying to learn how to organize your game and how to play better ?
you have played her a couple times last year .
have you noticed any changes in her game ?
do you think the weather today was a bit too harsh for you for the game , for the match ?
which do you like more , the quiet of indian wells or the sort of big city of miami ?
are you a big partier generally ?
now you 're not allowed to anymore ?
is n't it more boring this way ?
so you have your fingernails painted .
what 's up with this finger ? why is that orange ?
have you ever tried to do that before , match your nails to your outfit ?
to a nail salon ?
have you ever talked to serena about nails ? she 's like a certified professional nail person .
she could give you french nails .
long day . bunch of long matches before you , and then a long match yourself . how does it feel to get through it all ?
they let the night session in so it filled up very fast and loud the whole time . must have been not bad ?
for the fans , that 's a lot of fun to watch a match like that . is it fun for you in any way , or is it just too stressful to enjoy the moment ?
it seems like it was never going to end . were you frustrated by that ?
what do you feel about the people , the latin people that have been following you here in miami ?
have you ever had a match with nine match points ?
for mexico , do you remember your times in the florida playing ? how do you feel to play in florida ?
obviously you have gotten through a lot of these long matches before in the past , and i guess safarova has n't won as many of these sort of tight matches . you 're about the same age roughly . what do you think it is that lets you get through time and time again ?
how is the shoulder ?
sometimes the women 's games get criticized , but today your match and serena 's match were close to three hours and three sets and a lot of good tennis . can you talk about what that means for women 's tennis to have two great matches today ?
wonder what you thought of the video at the end .
would you rather be considered pretty or tough ?
you have played a bunch of matches against top players already in your career . this was one of the closest ones so far in your career . how did you think it went today ? how do you feel the match went for you ?
do you like getting to play these players a lot ? you played serena a few times ; you played sharapova ; you play the big players a lot .
are you the type of person who 's going to lay away tonight and think , if i had done this on this point , this on this point i would have won ? will you replay it over and over ?
so did you learn anything today ?
did you learn anything ?
at what point during the match did you feel the most confident , where you felt there was a chance where you could really maybe take the lead ? was it that first game of the third set where you were up 30love and you really had a chance ? and then you almost broke her that second game ? that seemed like it was an opportunity and maybe you could have gotten on a run there in the third set . how did you feel ?
was there a certain part of the match you felt the best , though , a moment where you said , i can do this ? i got it ?
so that was the moment ?
a lot of players are intimidated by serena from the beginning of the match . you can see the intimidation and people are timid and maybe do n't play their best against her . you did n't look at all intimidated by the opponent . how is that ? or were you and you just hid it well ?
what are your goals for the rest of this year ?
after you played sharapova in the french open , andy murray said he thought you 'd be no.1 someday .
i 'm sure you 've heard that a lot .
what do you make of that ? are you happy he said it or is there more pressure ?
but at the beginning it was hard to ...
have you ever met him ?
have you ever met andy ?
how did you get started in tennis ? what 's your background with tennis ? is it a family thing , or you just played it on your own ?
your father still coaches you ? your father is your coach ?
i saw amlie mauresmo was here watching you today . she 's beaten serena before . did she have any particular advice on how to play serena ?
what are the tactics against serena ?
not a bad win today .
she 's a pretty good player . how do you feel about that ? pretty happy about that ?
next up , li na . thoughts on that also ?
do you want more variety in your opponents ? do you want a crack at a serena soon or something like that ?
how much does it mean to you to be able to come to this tournament and be successful considering it 's not far from home ?
people were lined up outside to watch you . people were complaining , like , why is she on the small court ? we ca n't get in . when you hear that , you know , that this community , florida welcomes you that way , how much does that add to your experience ?
do you remember the first time you were here ?
what do you remember about that experience ?
what has gotten easier about playing on these stages or losing , whatever , learning experiences you have had ?
you and li na are both eisenbuddies . who do you think he will be rooting for ?
do you do eisenbuddy activities , like dinners or anything ?
would you like to ? it 's a fun group you have .
can you talk about what got you going ? i mean , it was really , really tight there , and then you started getting that serena wave that you get where it 's like , okay , i 'm going to start being serena now . at what moment did you become serena in that match ?
what was she doing that was throwing you off for a while ? seemed like she was not intimidated . what was she doing ?
she wobbled a little bit serving at 64 in the tiebreaker . that was a nervous double fault . what was your reaction when that happened ?
how are you feeling ? well ? almost everybody else played indian wells . is it an advantage or disadvantage with rest coming into the opening rounds of this tournament ?
did you take any vacations during that stretch ?
still dolphin colors ?
do you have any advice as a coowner for the dolphins ?
who is your favorite player ?
how did you analyze your play today just as a whole in the match , first match ?
couple times you went to the baseline and just started shaking your head . are you trying to get yourself back into the what are you doing that point ?
were you distracted by the fans with the noise in the crowd ?
switching gears just a little bit , i actually wanted to ask you about your faith . can you talk about how that 's affected your outlook on your career ?
do you ever pray when you 're on the court ?
how much is that first set going to help you since it was so tough ? will it make you like take you to the next level knowing when you go to the next round , having that in mind ?
how relieved were you at the end of the first set ? i mean , that final point of the tiebreaker , can you take us through that final point , what it feels like to get that set and get it behind you ?
no doubles with venus ?
what would make this tournament different for you ? it 's a home tournament for you . are you comfortable here ?
she made you work for a lot of the points , especially second set . it was a good match to get some rhythm out there .
how do you feel matchconfidencewise ? do you still feel like it 's a work in progress ?
she 's pretty much an unknown player for you . so what was the toughest thing to play against such a player , especially in the first round of a tournament ?
even though it 's a night session match , it was n't televised or streamed . is that something you notice when you 're on court ?
it 's just the way the tv deal works here . a lot of the women 's match are n't being shown , but they showed the men 's match after yours . do you think that 's a problem or something to be fixed for the wta side ?
how do you feel about coming to this tournament ? finals five times . you have been pretty close .
it 's like the only big title you have n't won , right ?
what makes you think this is the year that you can finally win this ?
you were playing late today , but it looked like you were hurting . how is your shoulder feeling ?
you were talking about obviously still building up confidence and strength . do you ever let yourself , you know , measure expectations in those situations , or do you always sort of set the same goals ? talking about a building year , building something like that , do you allow yourself that , or do you say , i have to go out all the time ?
is that what you learned most from your postsurgery comeback , i guess ?
how has the transition from indian wells to miami been for you so far ?
you said you enjoyed it for the first time . this has been a tough tournament for you in the past ?
we do not have internet . it was hard to look up previous head to heads , so i do n't know if you played davis before .
i 'm curious how much , if any , scouting you and your coaches do , if you saw her match with azarenka ?
you said you saw the azarenka match . what did you make of that match ? that was a crazy one , with the injury . as someone who has dealt with injuries before , what did you make of that whole situation ?
there are a bunch of american players , like john isner , who do much better when they are playing at home than when they are traveling . you as a serbian player never have that benefit .
how does it feel playing against an american player when they have kind of home court advantage ?
i know that you 're a big fan of indian wells because it 's relaxed and sort of away from things . you have been asked about the transition on court , but how about in terms of the general atmosphere around the tournament ?
who 's next for you ?
tough loss today . how do you feel about your preparation for the open ?
are you playing new haven ?
she was able to break you eight out of nine times . was she able to get a better read compared to last week ?
what were some things that your dad was talking to you about during the coaching session that kind of got you to where you could get to 64 in the third ?
were you distracted at all when serena , the trainer came out to see her ?
along the lines of your success in breaking her so many times in the last set , what do you attribute that to ?
what were you pleased with with what you did today ?
you two got to no.1 playing very different styles of tennis . do you think there is still room for both styles to be successful on tour , at the top of the game ?
do you feel more clarity on court now ? i know there were times you were trying to be more aggressive and did n't seem to have as clear a game plan as maybe the last couple weeks .
you mentioned some specific things that serena is very good at . does that mean that your preparation for matches with her is any different ?
when you talk about just having a substandard serving day , do you mean percentage ? power ? placement ? what exactly does that mean to you ?
so aside from the disappointment in your serving today , you were happy with the other aspects of your game today ?
did you feel like she was going for more on first serves today compared to montral ?
you 've been a fairly popular sort of dark horse pick already for the us open . people think with this form you 've shown you can make a good run there . do you feel that ?
how are you feeling on match play ? still confident you want to go through with playing new haven next week ? feel like you 've had enough ?
are they going to have you run around in the bulldog costume again ?
obviously a tough one . where do you feel like it fell apart for you at the end ?
looked like you were fairly flat energywise . how much impact does that actually have with kind of what your energy levels are like on the court .
second consecutive match of your opponent breaking you several times . is it a matter of something not working right with your serve , or are they 're getting good read on it ?
how did you turn the momentum back ? it was 62 , 40. may be a very short night .
you feel pretty good right now about where your game is going into the us open ?
what were your thoughts on the time that she took early in the third set ?
espn has some video of you tapping your shoulder and saying , check for blood pressure middle of the third set . were you angry or put off by what she had done ?
you think if they take a medical timeout midgame they should forfeit that game ?
does that distract you or put you off ?
you usually play on center court everywhere you play . last two you played on grandstand . any differential going back on center getting used to a different court ?
in the end , you think it was just a matter of , execution for you from your side ? tactical ? technical ?
end of the 54 game , you served and had two match points . do you remember what happened on those or how that lead slipped again ?
you 've got some time before the us open now . what are you going to do to kind of reset and prepare for the major coming up ?
would you say the cincinnati open is a good tournament to decide where you stand mentally and physically ?
yeah .
that was one of the wilder matches of the year . how do you feel having survived it ?
was it just a matter of nerves in the second set ? building that lead , you know , just a game away and you called dejan out .
what happened in the third set when you were getting the medical attention ?
was it a formal medical timeout ?
just an evaluation ?
you were really dominate the first set and a half . what was working exceptionally for you then ?
how did you get yourself going in the third after the second ?
is it hard not to think , as the second set slips away , oh , god , i was up ; this will be such a bad choke if i lose ?
how big of a win is this for your confidence ?
is it weird at all because sven and all of her team were sitting courtside in the photo pit . can you hear them ?
you have a former relationship with him . is there kind of like a moment where you 're like , whoa , he 's cheering against me ?
you broke her quite a bit to start the match and then quite a few times near the end of the match . were the breaks any different ? were you able to execute anything different on the back end of the match as opposed to the front end ?
you 're playing serena tomorrow . talk about that match and what you 're expecting .
did you see or hear anything from maria 's side about the medical timeout during the match ?
not a bad day at the office for you today . everything going the way it should be ?
just a quick question about some the videos about your pregame and prematch warmups . explain what 's going on there .
is it like cross fit or something ?
get you loose ?
jelena said she felt sluggish today and her game was n't going right . did you notice a difference in her compared to other times you played her , that she was n't quite on her game today ?
you used to tell the story about seeing venus walk on her hands . wondering if you ever competed on your hands ?
tomorrow you could play either caroline , rematch of a great match last week , or aga . talk about those . are those different matchups to you ? we see them as defensive type players , but are they different ?
roger last night was saying he was pretty happy with the number of matches he 's been playing , so he was going to go into tonight 's match against andy fairly relaxed and nothing to lose . do you feel that way ? you 've played a lot of matches .
do you need more match play ?
there was some focus at this tournament because it 's the only masters djokovic has n't won . and you , too . is that a bucket list item for your career to win the cincinnati title ?
not something you 're desperate for , i guess .
have you been nominated for the ice bucket challenge ?
ice and a bucket ?
you 've been so good on hard courts this year . talk about why you have been so dominate , especially today ? you said it was a grind . watching out there looked like you dominated start to finish .
do you feel better this week than last week at this stage ?
at the end of the match you gave a special shout out to some fans .
something that just kind of popped up today , or have they been following you ?
you going to bring him around for the rest of the tournament ?
nba fans can wear like a lebron jersey . there is no real like serena jersey for a fan to wear .
do you think in general tennis players should be branded more like team sport athletes are where you could wear your stuff , men or women could wear it , not just a guy in your dress or something ?
thoughts on the match ? obviously a tough one .
obviously you do n't want to feel that way going in against her .
but do you think it was more you today or was it her ...
you played her earlier in the year , right ? she 's had certainly a funky year . all of a sudden she 's on run .
are you planning to play fed cup any time soon ? i realize it 's down the pike , but serbia does have a davis cup . is that a career goal ?
right .
today aside , how do you feel about the state of your game going into the open ?
you 're talking about feeling tired . is that normal or are you like ...
three and a half weeks off , was that a planned period of time ?
you always have had a great presence on the court . do you love playing as much as ever now ?
how would you measure how you played earlier this year versus how you 're playing now ?
can you talk about today 's match ? seemed after that first break you really had control from there on out .
did you hit after the match ? did you go back to the practice court ?
just rhythm or ...
you could play either sloane or jankovic next . you have had interesting matches against them in the past . talk about what you expect from either of them .
what 's the status of your sort of relationship right now ? there was a lot of talk about that last year .
do you remember the first time you played at the us open in '98 ?
you played nicole pratt in the first round , three sets .
i wonder if you remember emotions or nerves around that or what the feelings were ?
a quick question about the open . the week before the open is kind of a busy one i think for a lot of the players with sponsorship obligations , kind of running around manhattan . is that something that 's changed over time for you maybe in your career , having to do more preopen compared to now , or is it exhausting at all before the tournament starts ?
does the open feel more busy than the other tournaments the week before ?
i want to talk about heat . i know it has n't been a factor here . just how you deal with it . then also i 'm doing a technology story on this cool seat that 's being tried out in the tournament . during a changeover you sit in this cool gel . it was tried in washington . would you be open to using that or would you even need any of that ?
when i talk to your fans here , they were wondering if you like to play here . some players , for them like warm up tournament before us open . some fans feel that way . how do you like playing here ?
you said you like watching andy murray because he acts like a baby sometimes .
can you relate to other emotional players ?
obviously some players show nothing almost on court . do you wish more players would express what 's inside them ?
talk about your match . how did you like the way you played today ?
along those lines of playing her before , is it any different playing someone from your same country as opposed to the rest of the field ?
what do you think the difference was in the tiebreak when you were able to really blow past her ?
do you like to play on not a small court but a smaller court ? it 's a little more intimate ?
you have simona halep next . talk about that match .
you have a different coach now than you did last year here at this time . can you talk about what sven has brought to your game and elaborate on what other coaches have n't got ?
he 's sort of anything but calm when you 're playing . is that something that you feed off of ? a lot of coaches are sort of stone faced throughout matches .
i 'm wondering if this tournament and at majors , as well , do you watch other matches on tv , or do you attend other matches either for scouting or just for entertainment purposes ?
do you remember the butterflies or the nerves when you first played a major , and if so , how you 've dealt with those in that situation ?
are you planning on having an exhibit for your candy company at the us open ?
that must be really cool , an idea like this and it 's taken off wildly . can you share your thoughts and how that all came about ?
what part of newyork is that ?
how many flavors are you up to ?
you 're going to go how many ?
when i talk to the younger fans of you today , it looks like the u.s. is becoming a training hub for many foreign players now . people feel if you do n't move to u.s. and train at the academy in florida you 're not going to make it to the top . but do you have any advice for foreign players living outside of u.s. ?
how do you feel after the first two matches here after a long break ?
a lot of players do n't particularly get the grasp of taking time off and everything . they feel , oh , i have always gone to that event or whatever . how important is it to know that your body and maybe your head needs like a vacation from tennis ?
back to the match , i think it was the seventh game in the first set you were up a break , but safarova was chipping away at it . she had a couple break points ; you had 18shot rally and then you put it away . is that the turning point in today 's match ?
what 's it like to get all these interview requests , tv interview requests , now that you 're the world no.2 ? is it a distraction at all or are you enjoying ?
you 're obviously no.2 , which is only one spot away from no.1 .
i 'm just wondering , some people say they think you should have to win a grand slam before you come to no.1 . what do you think about that ? because it 's possible it might come in another order to you .
you have obviously now played slams , you 've played premier mandatory tournaments , premier 5 tournaments . in the premier level tournaments the draws are smaller , so first and second rounds can be actually tougher than first and second rounds at the majors . how do you compare competing at the slams versus the premier level tournaments ? which one is more difficult ?
how many people are on your team ?
teams seem to be expanding , but the us open says like they give a player three badges . how do you ...
do you have a preference in terms of the courts here in cincinnati ? for example , here today you played your match on court 3. you 're no.2 in the world . safarova was a semifinalist at wimbledon , and yet on grandstand was janowicz and benneteau . does that matter to you ?
before the tournament started you said that you want to play your game with imagination .
so what does that mean to you ? when you say to play with imagination , what does that mean ?
you could play maria in the next round .
very tough matchup for you this year .
what makes her difficult to play and why has she been able to get the better of you this year ?
it disturbed you like you would just wait too long and get distracted ?
highquality match out there , serena . no breaks of serve ; very few break points . how were you able to pull that out in the breakers ?
do you think these tests you have been through stanford and montreal and here these kind of tight tiebreaker tests , threeset tests , good for you before the open ?
taking a more positive attitude in general , do you feel you 're carrying that onto the court with you or still battling some negatives out there ?
following up on that , you have obviously win matches like this . it 's such a game of inches . what 's it like to lose a match like this , as well ?
when you started working with patrick a couple years ago you guys had a lot of immediate success winning a lot of titles . how has this coaching dynamic changed ? it 's been a more disappointing stretch for you this year .
you just played sam in montreal and it was n't quite as close of a match . what was different today about her game ?
there is still significant tennis to be played this year , but talking like you 're on a reset for next year . how much of that has put what 's happened behind you , and how much is that to free yourself up so you can take on the rest of the year with less pressure ?
speaking of moving forward or going up , do you worry about holding on to no.1 ranking through the rest of the year ? you have a lot of titles coming up : us open , beijing , yearend championships . is that something you 're fretting over or something that if it happens it happens ?
first set today seemed like you starting pumping your fists and everything . did that charge you up for the second set ?
where would you rank sam 's second serve on tour ?
is there any part of you , do you think , that thinks that you have a bit more of an edge when you 're trying to chase somebody down or chase down a ranking or a title than when you 're on top , no.1 , kind of queen of the tour ?
today 's a sold out crowd in cincinnati and there is a lot of great matches that people can see . if you were here as a fan , would there be one player in particular you 'd want to watch ?
what do you think it will be like facing taylor if you face her next ?
have you seen much of taylor ?
would you consider yourself a tennis wonk ?
somebody who like is into the game , watching it , picking it apart . i 'm talking about your free time or when you 're done with tennis , the last thing you want to do is watch other players or men 's matches or whatever ?
is there any player in particular ? i 'd think roger , but is there anybody you would n't think is obvious you 'd like picking apart and maybe take something from him ?
why is that ?
he was in here earlier in press while you were on court and could n't stop watching you .
quite a different look from last week . very close match .
what stands out to you ?
how are you feeling physically coming out of the other night ? i think i saw you call for the doctor at some point .
you seem great today .
do you go into like a us open because you won it , with a different feeling at all as opposed to other tournaments ?
you have played serena on a lot of different stages . where is her level do you think right now compared to some other years ? do you feel like she 's a little more vulnerable than she has been in the past ?
you seem to bring the best out of each other every time you play . most of the time , anyway . what is it about it from your point of view that sort of lifts you ?
you come from a rich tennis tradition . how much do you think former players sort of inspire other generations and players to come forward ? do you think that has much of an influence or not ?
do you feel evonne goolagong brought more minorities into the sport in australia ? as a first nation kind of person , did that kind of inspire you think similar people to play tennis ? did it have any lasting effect ?
what influence did kerry melville and judi teggart of the original 9 have on australian women and australian players ?
they actually were told at the time just not even to come back to australia because they would n't be allowed to play in any events . obviously tennis in australia has grown beyond that .
when you win the point or lose the point , you seem to control your emotions so well . i was watching your game with other audience , and they said , wow , she 's so quiet . never saw any emotion . is that in your nature or you have to train to be that way ?
what is one of the best pieces of practical advice you 've gotten that 's resonated or stayed with you throughout your career ?
just a question from left field . we hear quite a lot about the atp players council , but we do n't hear much about the wta players council . i understand you 're one of the leaders of the council .
so just wondering how you feel about your role in the wta players council .
what are some of the recent things that you have been discussing or working on ?
is this a type of social activism like where you 're able to be involved ?
what did you think about your performance today ?
looked like the wind was blowing a little bit . did that affect you in any way ?
you have played well here in recent years . what do you seem to like about playing here ?
do you feel you 're playing good with thomas so far ?
what are some of the things he 's been telling you to work on or practice ?
if you had a ticket to watch today on the grounds , like as a fan , what match or matches would you want to watch ?
i know kim clijsters was your idol growing up , but did the williams sisters have any influence on you coming up as a junior player ?
when did you remember first seeing them or being conscious of them ?
do n't remember a first match on tv or anything like that ?
2005 ?
who do you look up to as far as being a role model ? somebody else who is a great role model , as opposed to a famous player ? who do you follow ?
what 's the best practical advice you 've ever gotten as a tennis player ?
are you more inclined to watch women 's or men 's matches ? just leisure . does n't matter .
so what kind of happened out there for you and how do you see that match ?
do you feel like you 're hitting the ball well in practice ?
just rhythm or timing ?
as you come on to the tour and get experience and get really good and everything else , along the way does it eliminate doubts of what to do on the court , whether you belong with the top players ? does it get better as you go along , or are there still moments where you kind of wonder what 's going on ?
do losses like this , do they affect your confidence at all , or do you put aside and it does n't help , does n't hurt ?
will you have competition between now and the open , or are you just going to train ...
it 's a tough field in new haven this year .
it 's a tough field in new haven this year , huh ?
is it helpful to you to spend the week before the us open outside of newyork and in new haven where it 's a little bit calmer , just , you know , energywise as opposed to just spending it in newyork and training for the open ?
are there things that you have done differently here year after year in newyork to make it easier for you ?
the american players often are impressed by how european players can speak different languages . how many languages do you speak ?
why do you think that is ? is it because europeans , you know , you 're so close together and you have to learn other languages , or does it come because of your tennis career that you have to ...
so when you joined the tour , was that one of those things you did n't have to worry too much about , that if everyone else was speaking english or something that you could feel comfortable right away ? is that something you had to worry about as another element of being comfortable on tour ?
i was wondering what influence martina navratilova had for you , being czech and being a lefty , all that ?
obviously a tough turnaround physically , but just talk about that a little bit . disappointed to get your match ended so early on tuesday ?
when did you get in , sunday or monday ?
parts of your game that you were n't happy with or did n't feel were up to snuff ?
is it hard to get used to playing deep into tournaments every week ?
after what you did last week , do you look at this as a setback at all or she just played ...
how happy are you with your us open prep overall ?
when you won the challenge near the end and won the last game , did you feel yourself gaining some momentum there ?
how does this alter your plans ? do you stay here and practice ? do you go home and practice ?
you look so sad about that .
in canada , were you surprised by how well you were able to bounce back day after day after tough physical matches , or is that what you can expect from yourself now ?
for those of us who were n't there , can you just address a little bit the fact that it 's been a while since you had a win over serena ? you got so close , but you have also had a great career rivalry .
you have had some good success at wta events , but have n't quite been how you 'd like to be at the slams last couple of years . anything you 'd change in your approach going into new york ? try to change something or i do n't know how you focus on that ?
it was a little windy out there . when your toss gets wonky and everyone 's does once in a while , do you ever feel bad or embarrassed after catching it after you toss it up ?
has there been talk with serena about playing doubles in newyork ?
how did it feel out there ? seemed like the first few games were kind of taking a long time .
how much confidence do you take from that win ?
tough first round encounter .
are you finding conditions quicker or slower than the other hard courts you 've played this summer ?
how are the first couple of weeks with thomas ?
when you switch coaches and everything , is there like a getting to know each other in terms of how you do things and process things and everything , that that period is that tough or something you just kind of ...
he has a great reputation or something ? what made you key in on him ?
what about barbora in the next round ?
where is your confidence right now ?
yeah .
how are you approaching this year in the states compared to last year , the year before ? you sort of had these growing experiences year after year . what are you taking in 2014 that you had n't before ?
some of the other players have been talking about background noise , whether it 's consistent or not consistent . how do you feel about that in terms of like here you can hear noise from the other stadiums . does it make a difference to you ?
can you just talk about the match a little bit and the difference in the second set when the game or match kind of shifted there a bit ?
have you practiced much with her before ?
not really ?
what did you see in her game that was different that surprised you ?
would you consider her one of the more powerful players on the tour already this year ?
you took a bit of a break between the second and third set . you were getting a bit animated towards the end of the second set . looked like you were frustrated . was it just to kind of calm down ? you came out much more level headed and cooler .
when you were walking off , the cameras kind of caught you rubbing your right shoulder a little bit as you were exiting court . is there any issue there ?
when you were gathering yourself between points , are you literally talking to yourself ?
in english or russian ?
today you lost more first return points in the third set as opposed to the second set . second set you lost . the third set you won .
you lost a lot of return points . in the third set , you actually lost more of them than in the second set . what i want to know is was this another opportunity where you raised your game in the third set or is this a chance where the opponent , you got into their head in the third set ?
how hard is it playing a player like her first match out this week ?
were there any flashbacks to the first match last year against sloane ?
do you find as you get older that there are more occasions that you 're having doubts about things , or is that something that 's more prominent when you 're really young or when you 're young you just do n't think and you just play ?
you have been an up and coming sort of player to watch and played a lot more with the veterans . do you take kind of a tiny bit of pleasure sort of showing the new players who 's the boss ?
gamewise , what were you happy with today and what were n't you ?
how are you feeling about this year in general ? i mean , it 's been a very good year for you . interested in your thoughts on how this year has been compared to other years .
you have had a lot of accomplishments in your career : been no.1 , won slams . you have never had a twoslam year . is that something that would be important to you at all ?
going forward , would you consider playing fed cup again for russia , or would that depend on where in the world you 're playing at that time ?
you were off the court fairly quickly . no blowing kisses to the crowd . any particular reason why ?
you said yesterday that you were looking forward to this match because you came up with no pressure having never faced maria . talk about today . did you feel pressure ? how did you feel out there ?
it went well for you in the second set . what were some of the things you were able to figure out and feel good about implementing there ?
in the third set , did you back away from that , or did she step up her game ?
how do you feel that your experience over the last 12 months or so helped you out in a match like today 's ?
obviously you use oncourt coaching during the wta tour , and then when you get to the slams , the us open , you wo n't be able to call the coach to help with tactics . is there any concern whatsoever about that kind of difference ?
but you 're confident in your ability to think yourself through a match ?
on your own ?
you obviously won a title not too long ago , but between a year ago and now , what are you most happiest about your game that you have been able to achieve from one year ago ?
are you entered in new haven ?
are you going to try and play new haven ?
just wonder if you can talk about last week . how much of a confidence boost was your run in montreal ?
your form since the french open , we have seen the uptick and the quality improving . was it hard work or a mental thing ?
is there one particular tournament where you felt your level go up ?
in the second set she started coming back a little bit . you were trying to be aggressive also . how do you feel about how you played overall today ?
a few times did it feel like you were trying to be more aggressive with your backhand and then you missed more shots , but then at the end there were very few unforced errors .
are you looking forward to the rest of the season at this point given how well you have been playing lately ? goals settingwise , what are you looking for for the remainder ?
when is the last time you felt you had that threeset , grindout battle ans you walked off the court with you were head high and swaggering a bit ?
what was the toughest stretch maybe the past year or two in terms of how you felt about your game ?
is it hard in a tournament like that , you know , there is so many great competition , such a big event . so do you feel you really do n't have time to have an easy match ? every match seems to be very tough here ?
you are looking in great shape .
you we know you 're training for a marathon , right ?
do you feel like your body has been changing in a good way , actually ?
good balance ?
you have already been through quite a few distinct phases in your career . do you feel like a veteran or do you feel like ...
what have you sort of gained in that time ? what do you feel is something you used to have that you do n't have anymore ?
and have you gained anything ?
have you always been able to compartmentalize playing against somebody that you know very well off court ? you seem to be pretty good at it , but has that always been the case ?
but is it hard if the other person does n't feel that way ? obviously you might play somebody who ca n't compartmentalize , as well .
( indiscernible . )
mauresmo , she ...
less than four hours . she might be a good person to ask .
was there anything else you thought about , like a winter sport or anything like that ?
i know you 're playing such great tennis . just won another title . you have so many already . you did your best a few years ago . how do you feel ? do you feel prepared mentally and feel strongly that it 's a good surface for you ?
another main draw ; another pro win .
at this point , is this not new for you anymore ? is it getting to where you almost expect yourself to get past the first round ?
heading into the us open , you have been third round obviously like you say . what kind of expectations do you have ? are you trying not to put pressure on yourself ? what 's the frame of mind ?
it seems like you 're working hard . a lot of matches that you 're winning are 75 in the third or 76 or 64. is that a good thing , getting yourself like time to stay in the point and pull it out ?
what did you like most about the way you played today ? was it the mental thing you just talked about ?
is that the hardest thing to learn , that mental part , for somebody starting out trying to make a name for herself ?
what did you learn today ?
it sounds like as your confidence builds that you 're able to kind of dismiss little moments of insecurity . do you find yourself still having to deal with that , that you 're insecure about where you are or what to do ?
doubt , i guess . what do i do now kind of thing , or does that kind of go away as you keep playing better ?
i 'm guessing you might think that world teamtennis needs to have a few rule changes . i have never quite seen anything like that obviously observing it , but what is it like playing doubles by yourself ?
do you think that they should change , like have extra bodies , bench warmers , or forfeit a match ?
setting aside like mental over experience , from the beginning of this year to now , what have you learned , like the one thing that you learned about your game tactically or technically on court ?
is it still fun though ? i know obviously you can do a lot of shot making , and if you keep it simple sometimes it 's a quote/unquote boring way to win . is that any tension at all ?
are you a major fisherwoman ?
did that go as well as you anticipated this week or better than you thought ?
how much did winning eastbourne really improve your confidence and kind of put you on a path you wanted to be on ?
your crosscourt forehand seemed to be really strong today . is that going to be one of your feature things ?
do you think that your eastbourne win at all up until that point , good year ; not many big results or anything like that how much of it did it click for you in terms of confidence after that ? do you feel like a different player out there ?
how much time did you take off once you got home ? how long did it take to kind of heal up ?
so how does one go about duplicating the really good stuff ? you know , once you played really well and feel really good about things , can you consciously try and figure out what you did , or is it a matter of just playing and not thinking too much ?
so now that you 're not jumping off a bridge when things are n't going well , have we also learned how to like deal with that and change things around , or is that the next step ?
you will play maria next , so thoughts about that match . are you excited for the challenge ? do you think you can pull it off ?
do you watch her a lot ?
obviously there is a focus going into the us open . do you sort of sense that at all yourself ? do you think it 's any harder on the guys because ... ( indiscernible . )
do you have any thoughts on court conditions here compared to the other hard court tournaments you have played this year ? faster or slower ? does n't matter ?
do you change your preparation based on those perceptions , or they 're just higher priorities on the list , how a surface affects your game or does n't ?
what would be the next jump for you ?
the word `` pressure '' can be very generic . is there a difference in how you feel about the pressure playing in the states versus the pressure playing in the eastbourne final ? or like the fourth round wimbledon . does it feel different ?
is the only thing that feels different when you 're in the states is just the fact that things are familiar languages that you hear , american accents everywhere , better court placement ? what makes it feel different than a european tournament ?
the foreign players basically are forced to learn english , but they also speak multiple languages a lot . americans just seem to be lacking in that department .
did you take any language in school ?
would that be your first choice when you learn a second language ? would it be spanish ?
what else is it sort of like with school ? ( indiscernible . )
what 's the last book you read ?
what was the most interesting thing ?
could you relate a little bit ? she 's very selfcritical in that book and talks about how negative she gets on court . a little bit of you there ?
is that the best match you 've ever played in your life ?
over the last three years what did you imagine it would be like if you got this chance again , and what was it like for you ?
what does it mean ?
are we seeing the dawning of the age of petra , many grand slams to come ? no pressure .
you played some incredible defense today . have you ever ran like that in your life ?
did you feel like you were in the zone ?
would you say this is the best match you ever played ?
you just said you played with more focus than you 've probably ever played with . in the past , in the three years since you won last time , sometimes the confidence has been down . how important has your new mind coach been to changing things around ?
how close were you to not playing in wimbledon after your injury in eastbourne ?
did you ever think that you were n't going to make it here to wimbledon at that moment ?
yes .
i believe it was the quickest final in terms of time in 31 years . are you aware of that ? i believe it was martina navratilova who picked you by just one minute . how much would it have meant to you if you could have beaten that ?
at what point during the match did you realize you were in the zone , that you knew you had your game today ?
over the period of time since 2011 , what makes you feel best about your work , what you 've done all this journey ?
at the moment you won , what went through your mind ?
you were talking about martina navratilova when you received your trophy . she was watching you today . is your goal to be achieve more than she did ?
as much as you were in the zone today , to be in that zone under these circumstances , what was the feeling like on the court while you 're going through this amazing run ? how different was the feeling as opposed to the last time that you won here ?
your dad was crying at the end . does he cry a lot , your dad ?
you said your goal is not to win as many titles as martina here . with the game you have and the way you play here , do you imagine in your future many more titles here ?
what does that word mean that you just said that he signed ?
so much was written and said about eugenie bouchard in the buildup to this final , the coming star from canada . anything in your performance today that said , do n't forget about petra kvitova ?
my point was , your performance was so emphatic . nobody predicted it was going to be as onesided as it was . was that a statement of intent , you saying , do n't forget what petra kvitova can do on a tennis court ?
last time you won here you went on to end the year no.2 in the rankings . do you have ambitions to be no.1 ? would it be more important for you to win different grand slam titles somewhere else ?
be totally honest now . what 's more fun , clambering up on the roof to get to your friends and family or going through that boring old gate they installed ?
to get the box , they put the gate in . it 's not half as much fun , is it ?
you spoke a few minutes ago about making some shots that you did n't believe . how do you explain your mobility today ? it seemed like magic .
i imagine you got a sense of what petra kvitova did right to win that match . i wonder whether you have a sense of what you did wrong ?
it 's really hard to look at it from this standpoint at your age , but part of the growing pains of becoming a champ , it 's really hard for a lot of people at a younger age . do you see it at all that way or is it too soon ?
about your level of play , how did you feel you played ?
you 've spoken a lot about what you would do when this was all over . what are you going to do now ? what 's next in the next few days ?
you said you learned some lessons out of this . any particular lessons at this stage you will pick up on ?
how would you describe your hunger to win a major ?
you said yesterday that you would like to have the princess you 're named after in the royal box and she was there .
did she say anything to you at all ?
even when it was over there were people standing in the rain on henman hill shouting , we still love you , genie . these are brits who seem to have adopted you . what is it like to be aware so many nations have adopted you ? do you take that in or block it out ?
before this you 've had some big moments . walking out on centre court for the final is a whole different thing . what was the experience like ?
in any way did you feel overwhelmed by the moment or not ?
can you recall a time when an opponent played this well against you ?
you said on the court when you were talking to the crowd that you do n't really deserve their love . how do you think you 're going to react to this ? are you going to be too hard on yourself or will you be able to take the positives ?
can you give us an idea of what you did during that very brief break when the roof was closing ?
you were quite composed during your performances on the court , and off the court you 've been composed during your time here , even after the result today . as that match slipped away from you , at the end that must have been pretty gutwrenching , was n't it ?
you mentioned taking time off today , the rest of the day and maybe some ...
is there anything specific you 're going to do ? will you go out with family ? go for a meal ?
in retrospect , do you think you could have done anything different during the match to turn the tide ? of course , kvitova played out of her mind . could you have done anything different ?
nick is one of the best coaches in the game . have you spoken to him and what did he say to you ?
was there a turning point to the match , when you felt like that was it , i 'm not getting back into this ?
what do you think the reaction will be like when you get back home to montral ? a lot different profile than you had 12 months ago .
you said winning that junior title was the best moment of your career . at this point as you sit here , a finalist of wimbledon , making this run , does this surpass that or is still being a champion number one ?
do you have any kind of a comfort food or drink that you 've maybe denied yourself during wimbledon that you can treat yourself to now ?
you 're going to be in the top 10 next week . does it mean much to you or is it just a number ?
your sister has posted a picture online saying they were going to make an emergency trip to london . did they make it ?
is the cruel to make the defeated finalist sit in the engraver 's room before the presentation ?
would you rather wait somewhere else , though ?
is that almost a good thing that you were in that room as opposed to somewhere elsewhere your mind would go a little nuts ? was there a wow factor at all , what just happened ? did you feel any of that after the match ?
how difficult is it to play not only a friend but a girl that you know so well and is a lefty and has a more or less similar game like you have ?
how would you describe your journey as a player since you were last in the final and your emotions on being back in a wimbledon final ?
how about your journey from 2011 until now ? how would you describe those three years to being back at this point ?
the crowd seemed quite quiet today for centre court . did you find you were having to psych yourself up ? would you expect that to be a little different in the final ?
tracy austin said on the bbc commentary at the start of this tournament that perhaps you 'd underachieved since winning here in 2011. do you feel like you 've underachieved in those three years ?
when you look at almost the czech players going back over 50 years , they all peaked after 25. you won wimbledon very young . do you think that created expectations of you that you were not ready to handle at that time ?
what is it about this tournament that seems to bring the best out of you ?
is it more than the surface , though ?
did you come back as a different person ? you 're more grown up , maybe more used to handle the pressure now . do you feel you 're a different person ?
you said it was difficult to play a friend , but you 've beaten lucie six times out of six , so it 's more difficult for her than for you . what exactly is so difficult about playing a friend ?
how have you been able to stay the course after the wimbledon win to now ? you have n't changed coaches . you have n't moved to monaco . you have n't done a lot of things . i 'm sorry , you did move to monaco . you have n't done a lot of things that players have struggled after a big win might do . talk about that a little bit .
you had obviously to withdraw at eastbourne because of the injury . you said it was n't too serious . it was to make sure you 'd be right for wimbledon . but now at this point , are you pleased you made that decision to do that then ? was there a point when you worried you might not be ready for this tournament ?
you said something about it being harder for girls to keep up this success . why do you think that is ?
i remember your coach saying a long time ago he tried to get you out of tennis sometimes , to cinemas , to art galleries . does he still do that ? is tennis slightly less important for you than other players ?
that 's what was said a couple years ago .
whoever you play in the final , you 'll be favorite .
on paper . are you happy with being favorite ? it 's obviously a bit more pressure . do you feel the favorite ?
since we do n't know yet who your opponent will be in the next match , i 'd like to ask you about each one specifically so we 're prepared to preview that match . starting with eugenie bouchard , how would you describe her style ?
yes , how about halep ?
what would be the key for you to beat either one of them ?
when you won in 2011 you were driving a skoda car . are you still driving the same car ?
is it a sports psychologist actually on your team ? if so , how does he help ? what sort of things do you work on ?
how did you feel you played ? when you were a bit injured at the beginning of the first set , how was your condition during the match ?
was there a prior injury or it happened during the point ?
how much did the distraction in the tiebreak in the first set put you off your game ?
you played her not so long ago . on this surface and in her game , have you noticed any differences in her level , what she 's doing ? has she improved in the last couple of months ?
with the net cord and the ankle , did you think it was n't going to be your day ? is it hard not to think like that ?
i know you had a problem with the ankle , but can you explain why you feel you lost your energy in that second set ?
what will you take away from this tournament and what are your goals for the rest of the year ?
you said you had two injuries . what was the second one ? you had tape on the leg .
can you feel from your side of the net how determined she is , how focused she is ?
you said you think she could be at the top very soon . why do you think that ?
you had great success in the three majors this year , but you 're a little bit tired . how are you going to keep that success going and at the us open ?
you mentioned she 's tall . does she just look bigger than other players when you 're playing against her ?
will you have a break after bucharest ?
where are you going to go ?
beach or ...
how much of a relief is it to get past the semis this time and make it into a grand slam final ?
you seemed so subdued in victory . what are the emotions that you experienced on the court when you realized you were in the wimbledon final ?
what does this mean to you to be the first canadian to reach a grand slam final ?
what went on with the first match point ? you seemed to have a long discussion with the umpire .
what about the incident in the tiebreak when you had to stop ?
do you think you 're further into concentrating than a lot of other players ?
you talked about success not feeling ahead of schedule for you . when did you sort of feel like you might be in the 2014 wimbledon final ? when did this seem like a plausible goal ?
do you think justin bieber will have noticed you yet ?
he 's not been in touch then ?
you talk a lot about looking forward to your next match . i wonder whether or not as this twoweek period has gone on you 've taken any time to look back at the run you 've gone on here and how that makes you feel , and what lessons you might be able to take out of the previous matches you played here ?
you 're now set to play in the biggest match on the biggest court in the biggest tournament . the other day you were talking your favorite show is the big bang theory . do you think this is a kind of a big bang ?
you said yesterday with the royal visit that you 're excited about getting out to centre court to see who was up there . colin firth must be a fairly poor second best . given justin bieber is not royal box material , who would be your dream person to see there on saturday ?
he might not be the top of the invite list . they would n't let him through the gates .
it 's been a good tournament for canada . have you had much conversation in the last few days with your compatriot , raonic , and do you fancy the chances of maybe seeing him on sunday night perhaps at the champion 's dinner ?
how much did nerves come into play on the match points at the end ? was it more so than in the other semis just because victory was at hand maybe ?
in terms of that calm , how much does it help that you 've been here before , you 've won at wimbledon here before two years ago ?
do you have any unusual fitness regimes ? i understand you do hurdles and also run dragging weighted sleds behind you ?
if you win on saturday , are you likely to go crazy with your celebration ?
you seem very composed all the time . it seems to me like if there ever was a time to lose your composure it would be winning your first grand slam final . do you ever go nuts ?
i do n't know if you 've been on your phone , but hundreds of people have been tweeting you asking you to marry them . what do you think of that ?
anything special you want to reward yourself with after having played such a great tournament ?
as someone who has played the full two weeks here , can i ask how key for you the middle sunday is ? is it something you quite enjoy ?
a lot of people are comparing you to maria sharapova and anna kournikova , saying you 're the big moneymaker on the women 's tour . what are your thoughts on that ?
when you think about petra kvitova , what do you remember of her winning wimbledon ? what are your thoughts on the challenge of facing her now ?
what do you recall of her triumph here in 2011 ?
since you are such a big fan of roger 's , if i would have told you several years ago you would both would be in this position , in a similar spot at wimbledon , what would you have said ?
amazing story .
got off to a really good start today and then turned the other way quickly . what changed do you think ?
was there anything about your game today that you were disappointed in that you were n't able to execute ?
when a game starts running away from you like that , is it difficult to change the direction of the game ?
was your injury giving you any problem ?
this is one of your better results of the year making quarters here . not as good as last year , but overall are you happy with this result ?
with all this talk about the analysis of your game , has the information that ibm has been providing this year , was that of any help to you in analyzing your game ?
did he help you to adjust your game at all based on that ?
what are you looking forward to for the rest of the season ?
what do you think it is that you need to do or change to get that success ?
can you say one thing about halep 's game and what makes her so difficult to play against ?
how hard was it just to come back one day after that long , tough match with maria ?
i guess the 3all , the four breakpoints , you look back now and might have changed things a bit .
are there many players who are as aggressive as her ? when it 's dangerous , she seems to get more aggressive . is that just because she 's young ?
did you know before the match , because she was able to play on monday , that she might have an advantage in terms of rest ?
do you think she could go all the way ? how do you evaluate her play versus halep ?
overall are you happy with your tournament ?
ibm has been providing more detailed analysis of the games . has that been of any use to you ? have you been able to gear your game to other opponents because of what you see there ?
what suddenly changed for you ?
what changed today ? you were 41 down and then did n't lose a game .
you 're playing eugenie bouchard in the next round . you played her in indian wells this year . what did you learn from that match ?
back into the semifinals . does it feel different this time than it did in paris ?
do you think it will be tougher to play eugenie bouchard on grass than on other surfaces ?
a lot of the players said the transition from french open to wimbledon is the toughest thing . as you know , nadal lost and sharapova already lost . you managed to keep playing really well on this surface . what is the secret for you ?
you said on television that was the best you 've played . did you mean during this tournament or this year ?
do you think playing lisicki is good preparation for playing bouchard ? they 're both big hitters .
you saw what happened to sabine last year . she played fantastic , beat serena , got to the final , and found the occasion too much . happened to agnieszka before that . are you confident you can handle the pressure of being at this stage of wimbledon ?
you 've gotten better and better , coming up very steadily . with these tremendous results , do you think to yourself , wow , this is really great ; i 'm at the top of the game ?
tell us what it is you like about centre court and wimbledon .
what are you going to do tomorrow when you have a day off before the semifinals ?
ilie nastase is one of the great characters . the other day he was in the royal box with the uniform of the romanian army and so forth . what do you think of him ? what did you think of that uniform ?
your results over the first six months of this season , do you think that right now you feel less pressure than you did coming into the year given points to defend and pressure and whether or not you could play well at the majors ? now you have . do you feel like maybe the rest of this year you 're playing with house money ?
how many messages are you getting from back home ? how much interest is there in your progress at wimbledon ?
it 's your third consecutive semifinal appearance . what do you need to do in your game to take it one step further ?
the four breakpoints at 3all , you played them all fearlessly . obviously you never think about playing them any other way but that , right ?
what sense do you have of the excitement in canada , or the following , and how do the messages get back to you about that excitement ?
princess beatrice is at wimbledon today . could you tell us about your sister and what her support means to you ?
kate and william were here today .
what do you like so much about england ?
how would you feel about becoming english like greg rusedski ?
are you fiercely patriotic ?
can you take us through a little bit how you 're going to prepare for the semifinal , the thought process you 're going to go through ?
what is your typical routine the day of a match ? what is important for you ?
nick talked again and again about being in the moment . we know that . you 've done something really incredible with the junior championships and then your rise in the wta ranks . now so close to an incredible title . do you ever think to yourself , this really is pretty special ?
you won a tournament at 14 , but when did that belief that you were going to be a champion kick in ?
there have been some improved statistics of play from ibm this year . have you used any of that in your preparation for the games ?
you seem so cool on the court even when you 've dropped your serve . what makes you lose your cool on and off the court ?
would that extend to the royal family if they 're walking past you ?
will that impatience extend to waiting for players on the court ? there 's talk about having a stop clock at the back of the court . does that annoy you waiting between points ?
you seem to love england and london . have you been out at all in town since you 've been here ?
when you won the junior title a couple years ago , could you have imagined being back here again so close to the main title ?
you have talked a couple times now about trying to enjoy the tournament . when you walk out on centre court with god knows who in the royal box , sunshine , are you able to enjoy that moment at all , or is it 100 % focus ?
given your links with the royal family ...
is it an added incentive potentially playing in front of the royal box , maybe getting presented with the trophy by a royal ? any extra bonuses for you ?
on the court it 's obviously pretty simple . you just go out there and try to win . off the court , players have to make decisions about how much they want to be out there , how big they want to be . how do you make those decisions ? who do you go to ?
in terms of endorsements , public appearances , things like that .
you 're playing simona halep , and you played once before . that at indian wells on hard court . you lost in three sets . what did you learn about that match and what do you think about your chances tomorrow ?
you were the favorite after serena exited . does it make the loss today more difficult to take ?
what do you think the difference was in the match , and what will you take from the way you saved all those match points ?
what about in the end when you were down half a dozen match points and were able to save them . can you describe what that was like for you .
petra kvitova is the only grand slam champion winner left in the tournament . does this represent a changing of the guard ?
kerber made so few mistakes today ; was that frustrating to play against ?
you opened a candy shop in wimbledon . why ? will you spend more time there now that you 're not competing anymore ?
is it going well ?
will you be there now ?
you mentioned the other day about how hard it is to do the double . it is n't just switching from clay to grass , but it 's the extended period of clay . are you a bit worn out mentally and physically from the last few months and then winning the french ?
it 's rare that you have this number of unforced errors . did you feel you were fighting it at times today or just missing ?
now that you have a free day tomorrow , will you go into the players box to watch dimitrov against andy murray ?
when you won here so young , it looked like you had a game sort of tailor made for this surface . how has your relationship with grass changed over these last 10 years ?
has it become more challenging or do you feel it 's circumstances one year to the next ?
you 've come in for a little bit of criticism about the sweets shop , given it 's not the kind of food for athletes .
which of the sweets do you eat ?
which ones are your favorites , please ?
what 's it made of ?
there were a few rallies , especially today . you were hitting big and hitting so flat , yet she was still able to get the ball back . is that a credit to her anticipation and defense , or is it really that the surface has slowed down and we 're seeing a few more of these protracted rallies ?
who would you pick out of the girls that are left in the draw as the most likely winner here ?
both you and serena williams are out now before the quarterfinals . what is happening to the big experienced stars ?
yes .
there 's a lot of tennis ahead in the summertime . having won one major , does that help you get through the rest of the season and free you up a little bit because you already have that one in your pocket ?
you have the most heartwarming smile of all the tennis players .
where does it come from ? i do n't see your father ever smiling when you 're playing .
you had some trouble during that match ; called a medical timeout at breakpoint . talk us through that period of time .
darren cahill has said if you call a medical timeout in the middle of a game you should forfeit that game .
you should give it up , not be able to win that game . curious timing to take a medical timeout . do you think there was any way you could finish the game before you took your medical timeout ?
how is the arm now ?
what can you tell me about your next game against simona ?
did your opponent say anything to you during the timeout period ? was she getting frustrated ?
she did n't want to initially come to her chair . she looked a little curious why on breakpoint the medical timeout occurred . did she say anything to you or did you say , sorry , i have to take the timeout ?
did you think about waiting just the one point ? there was a changeover one point away .
did you think about just the one more point where there would be a natural break in the set ?
you served 20 doublefaults . was it a problem throughout the whole match , would you say ? so for the second set there was some erratic serving . was it then that the shoulder was hurting , or was that different to the injury ?
are you going to be all right for tomorrow ?
how is it feeling now ?
this is your fifth time in the quarterfinals in a row . you obviously like the place .
last year was very close . any sort of sense of wanting to amend that and finally go all the way ?
do you need massage and physiotherapy on your shoulder ?
i see that angelique kerber is up 2love in the third against maria sharapova . i want to know whether or not you talk with your fellow compatriots about how to take on your opponents , and have you given her any advice on how to deal with maria ?
there 's been some talk not just with this match , but other matches as well that there should be a revisitation of the medical timeout rule , that it should n't be midgame medical timeouts . do you have an opinion on that one way or the other ?
you said the serve was a problem irrespective of the injury . is that something you 'll have to work on ? twenty doublefaults .
usually it 's such a potent weapon .
obviously you were in a lot of pain , and your explanation is completely legitimate . what would you say to people who would say it was a tactical timeout ? you were about to lose the game .
what do you think we 'll see first : a german singles champion at wimbledon or germany winning the football world cup ?
how does it feel to be back in the semifinals here ?
the second set you were behind , looked like she was forcing you to another threeset match .
given how good you are indoors , i would think that actually closing the roof , you would like that . have you played under the closed centre court roof ?
do you like it ?
you 've been in the late stages of grand slams before . how does it feel playing all these other czech girls ?
do you have any sense as to what has made this tournament maybe different ? did you feel different coming into it , like maybe you were hitting the ball particularly well , relaxed ?
does it feel like you 've come into this tournament under the radar ? do you feel there was maybe less attention on you at this wimbledon ?
how big of an advantage is your experience ?
how would you compare what your days are like when you 're not playing now compared to back in 2011 ?
how you spend your time when you 're not dealing with tennis .
what are you watching these days ?
this is about your next match . how do you feel about this confrontation with eugenie bouchard which you played in roland garros ?
which surface would you think you would have a better result ?
can you take us through that period where you had the six or seven match points , how you managed to regroup after each one , and what it felt like at the end .
angie , what is your mentality when you take the court against maria ? what do you know and tell yourself that you have to do that day ?
the german football team never lose penalty shootouts . you come through seven match points and won . what is it about you lot ?
is there a certain steeliness in there ? you refuse to give in at any point ?
did you watch the football team last night and draw inspiration from that ?
the crowd seemed to be behind you today . did that surprise you at all ? sharapova is normally a big favorite here .
how do you regroup from such a big win going into your next match ? do you anticipate there might be a letdown meeting bouchard ?
you and maria were supposed to play yesterday . the match got called off . can you walk us through what your day was like yesterday . at what point did you find out you were off for the day ? now you have to play backtoback matches where genie got the day off .
was there any thought of maybe moving you to centre court and having that match finish there ?
what is your opinion on the noise that maria was making ?
do you have to learn to tune it out ?
what was it like the first time you played her then ?
how was your game different from roland garros ? what did you improve ?
do you find it surprising that an english crowd take to a german girl on centre court because of the historic rivalry between the two countries in sport ?
i was wondering , do you think there was any sort of fed cup hangover after having to make that long trip down to australia ? do you think it had any impact on your performance in the clay season ? maybe now you feel like things are better , or is there no relation whatsoever ?
tough one today .
was the pace of play an issue out there , as well ?
at points you appeared to feel she was n't in the time .
you said she 's a little bit of a different player . can you elaborate ? what most impressed you about her game ?
what difficulties might she pose for the upcoming opponents ?
you had a good first week . do you feel a little bit like it 's a bit of a missed opportunity ?
it 's been suggested that perhaps it 's time for a clock to be put on the court for that time between points . what would be your thoughts about adding that so it would n't be left to just the chair umpire 's decision making ?
would that take any of that room for error , interpretation , out of things ? would that make things a bit easier ?
what will you take out of the week going forward ?
are you still as motivated as ever ? you 've been on tour for years , a long time now . do you still have the same drive and desire ?
congratulations .
what do you make of that performance ?
what is it about the grand slams that brings out your best tennis ?
your quarterfinal opponent , lucie safarova , thoughts on that ?
what does it mean for to you reach a wimbledon quarterfinal ?
another fantastic businesslike performance today . how would you sum up how you 're feeling now ?
you 're one ever three czech players through to the quarterfinals now . is there something in the water at the moment ? something that 's been happening this year ? just luck of the draw ?
is it difficult to face a compatriot ?
will it go back to being a three setter for you , do you anticipate ?
yeah .
would be it close between you and her ?
you never played on the grass ?
is it starting to feel like 2011 again ?
is the experience of three years ago going to be important moving forward ?
tough going out there today .
is it disappointing because you felt this was a wimbledon you could really get to the far end of ?
you ever been involved in a match before that lasted for three days ?
i know it 's quite soon , but if you put into context everything you achieved on grass this year , what positives can you take out of it ?
do you feel you were missing because over this year you 've really stepped up your aggressiveness in your returning as well ? did you feel that was missing today ?
you said the break was n't good for you . when you start the match in the middle like that , do you go back and think about what 's happening in the match and talk about it with your coach ? because you usually do n't get a chance .
you were the first player to get a big win over serena this year . did you get a chance to watch any of the cornet match ? do you sense a difference in serena 's game this year compared to a year or two ago ?
sounds like you 're speaking from experience .
when it 's too dark to use hawkeye , do you feel like that 's a point the match should be stopped ?
do you think it was too dark to continue ?
did they even offer you the chance for that ?
a few times ?
what was the reason ?
ana , what are your thoughts on the issue of whether there should be a timer or a clock where you could see the time between points , so that if one player is a taking too much time you would know it ?
in any case .
change for the better ?
you were always behind a bit in the first set , but there was always the feeling you definitely were n't going away . did you sense she felt that , too ?
genie 's army threw a couple of toys at you . have you had any thrown over to you recently ?
down 42 in the second set , then 53 , can you give us a little bit of an idea as to the process you went through to gather yourself to come back ?
what was your level of play today ? do you feel it 's the best match you played since the start of roland garros ?
do you consider yourself someone who can compartmentalize pretty well ? we see you focus in point to point on the court , and then you come in here wearing a kimono .
as far as throwing things on the court , from a country where there 's a tradition of throwing things on the court , did that offend you ?
yes .
we know about your family 's interest in the royal family . the countess of wessex and a number of other royals were in the box . have you played for royals before ? how does it feel ?
of course at this moment we do n't know who your next opponent will be . i 'll ask you about each one separately . if you do face sharapova , what do you think is the biggest challenge of playing against her ?
you mentioned you improved your mental strength over the last year or two . have you done anything specific for that ? do you have a mental coach ?
you do n't have a mental coach or do that kind of thing ?
what do you feel you 've learnt most about yourself during this season from australia to now ?
you 're named after a princess . do you ever have princesslike tendencies ?
what are they ?
the big bang theory is such a wonderful show . what do you love about it ?
do you have a little bit a nerd in you ?
whether it 's sharapova or kerber , it 's grass this times as opposed to clay . how do you think that plays into playing either one of them ?
the delay today was considerably shorter than we experienced on saturday . any effect at all ? and tomorrow is canada day . any idea how you 'll mark it ?
you say it 's your mother that is a bit of a royal family nut . why is she ?
speaking of canada day , what does it mean to you to advance here like no player has before from canada ?
not to the quarterfinals in the open era .
what about you and milos , what sort of feeling do you think you 're giving the country with your advances here ?
you were so much in control at the end of that first set . what happened ?
you seemed frustrated by all the dropshots . was that a tactic she used in dubai also ?
were you frustrated at all by being scheduled on court1 and not centre court ?
did n't seem like you were swinging very freely through the second and third sets . just were n't feeling the ball well ? what was going on there ?
what were the things that she was doing especially well and what was giving you the most trouble in this match ?
is it hard to put your feelings into context right now ?
you were in reasonable form coming into this match . is that the biggest frustration , that this was a great chance to get into the second week and start from there ?
we 're used to seeing you dominate so powerfully in slams . do you sense this season it 's a case of other women closing the gap or more that you 're not playing to your potential ?
do you see any common thread between what happened at the australian open , what happened in paris , and what happened here ?
your serve has bailed you out of a lot of situations . is that a stroke that has n't been up to par in general this year and at this tournament ?
when you entered this match knowing you lost to her in dubai , how much did that factor into your mind ? did you think of the match in dubai ?
you 've been the dominant player of our era . your confidence must be shaken a little bit . can you talk about your confidence , maybe what you want to do to get things going .
do you think you need to make any changes to how you 're doing things if results , big or small , at these tournaments are n't what you want them to be ?
this is the first time in eight years neither you or your sister will be competing in the second week . will it be difficult for the two of you to turn that around next year ?
you 've won everything there is to win in this sport . what motivates you to keep going in situations like this ?
you spoke about how the other players get so up to play you . how about you ? how does your drive , how do your skills compare to years ago when you were winning this tournament so regularly ?
so you think you 're better now than you were then ?
that indicates it 's mostly about the other players rising up to your level . is that your assessment ?
frustrations like today , is that what drives you to keep coming back ? when you come back next year , will you keep this defeat in mind to give you that motivation to try to succeed ?
how unusual is it to be in that situation where you come off the court and you are n't sure why exactly you lost ? has that happened to you before ?
you had spoken a couple times about how the women step up and play the match of their lives against you . can you talk about that , why that is .
among all the factors that are still driving you to compete and push yourself , where does that 18th major rank ? is that a significant motivating factor for you ?
being that close to equaling martina and chris , is that at all in your mind as a pressure point for you , something that 's preoccupying you at these slams ?
before the tournament you said that you were n't over the french open loss . did you continue to feel that ?
what will the doubles mean to you , to be continuing with venus here ?
kind of a slight shock at the start , then cruised through the gears , nice relaxing couple of days off . what 's your assessment ?
were you aware that david beckham was the only person in the royal box who saw virtually all of your match ? are you inspired by stars from other sports or whether you learn from them ?
would he be someone you 'd be star struck by ?
what is it like to chat with him like that ?
sachin tendulkar was the other person who came in at the same time as david . do you know who sachin is ?
how difficult is trying to do the french open/wimbledon double ?
they 've installed a gate on centre court so that the players ca n't climb up onto the box when they celebrate . what do you think of that ? do you think that will ruin a wimbledon tradition ?
so you 're not worried ?
you spoke a moment ago about observing other athletes . one of the common dominators of course is rituals and superstitions . what are some of yours , if you had to pick the ones you 've had during your career , that stand out the most in your routine ?
are there other ones we could list that we see on the court and what they mean to you ?
when you reel off the number of games today , it looks like you 're able to flip on a switch . mentally is it a case of you saying , okay , i 'm really going to turn it on at this point ?
did you speak to david beckham today ?
is there one ultimate sports star you have met who made you star struck or one that you would like to meet ?
were you jittery meeting him , palms sweating ?
do you feel like a jock in the american sense of that ?
someone really into their sport , walks around with an aura of that , being someone who dominates others on the playing field , carries that into the rest of life ?
when you say the little things you have that help you prepare for matches , is there anything specific to wimbledon that you do when you come here ?
you 've had your shop and the businesses . do those things help , having extra things to do outside of tennis ?
back to the french open/wimbledon double . what are the challenges ? it 's been quite a while since someone on the women 's side has accomplished that feat .
have you changed anything up this year ?
the shop , has it gone as well as you hoped ? am i right in thinking it 's kind of a popup thing ?
it 's going to vanish ?
do you credit your top performance lately to being happy in your personal life ?
at the end of week one here , what are the things you 're most pleased with in your game as you move into week two ?
just generally how do you feel you played and what decided the match ?
you must sense she 's going to go for it , go for it , go for . when she 's going for it and making her shots , it 's pretty tough to be on the other end .
what was the exchange at the net ?
heading into the second set , what was your thought ? did you change your game plan at all ?
and flipkens , her forehand is very solid . how did you deal with that ? looked at first like it was a little bit uncomfortable for you , and then you dealt with it better .
how can you sum up your first week ?
your next match , sharapova .
so the game will be very much discerned by her game plan as opposed to trying to stop ...
and your current form , are you looking beyond the maria sharapova match ? do you think you can go all the way , or is it just one game at a time now ?
you had a look on your face that you almost looked guilty when you walked in here .
how do you feel in the hour since this win ?
you said you could n't play on grass a couple years ago . how bad were you and how did you improve ?
what happened after that first set to get you back into this ?
you scored a notable victory over her in dubai earlier this year . that was great , but it was n't a grand slam or a tournament of this magnitude . she said she did n't think about it . did you think about it ?
did you employ the same tactics ?
you said right now you wanted to play simply . what does that mean for you ?
what are your thoughts on the keys to your next match ?
serena said girls raise their game against her . did you go in today knowing you had to raise your game ?
early in the third set you were both at net , and she hit a winner and she screamed loudly . what did you think at that moment ?
how often do you kiss the court after a match ?
many players have admitted to feeling intimidated by serena . you clearly are n't in any way , shape , or form intimidated by her . were you ever intimidated by her ? why do you think the intimidation factor is n't so strong anymore ?
what is it about your game that makes you bring your best against the best players ? you 've played seven matches against americans this year , and you lost to players lower ranked . does n't make sense .
yes .
you said kissing the grass was new . what are some of your regular superstitions before and during a match ?
earlier this week benoit paire told the press that he hates the grass , he hates wimbledon , he wants to go home , he 's happy he lost . you 're talking about how much you love it . is this the most mental surface in tennis , grass ?
what are your thoughts about your match ? how did you feel about your level of play ?
how do you relax during that rain delay ?
what is your reaction to the match that decided your opponent ?
can you talk about the challenge for you in the next match .
there 's also the emotional part , which is always very important versus alize cornet .
so we could hear your coach saying , every point , genie . why was it important to focus on that aspect of the game ?
how did the match in charleston , your chances to win that one , how did that affect this match ?
what rituals or superstitions do you have surrounding a match either before or during ?
what is the story behind what you brought with you today ?
jim parsons was there to support you . how did you meet him ?
how did you first meet ?
do you like the show ?
you were pointing and laughing at something at the net .
it 's been like six months with the stuffed animals . how many do you have and what are you doing with them ?
historic day for canada in tennis . does that mean anything to you ?
pretty close to a level that i think you 'd like to be at . last match you had a poor beginning . you kept the level pretty good throughout the whole match .
you broke her serve a ton of times today . you kind of broke her mentally with all that aggression .
have you received any messages from the royal family since you 've been here ?
david beckham was there today . he 's royalty .
so many players talk about the dreamlike quality of getting deep into wimbledon . what is it like for you in that regard ?
it 's appropriate that you 're making a big bang , i guess .
first , i would like to know , you were very intense on the court during the match . tell us a little bit why you were frustrated .
2014 , first time in the main draw . can you tell us a little bit about what you go away with ?
not quite as straightforward as the scoreline might suggest ?
how good do you think she 's going to be ?
how nice does it feel to be back in the fourth round of a grand slam ?
have you or any of the other players fallen foul of the rules on wearing more colorful underwear ?
do you think it is creepy that some have been forced not to wear colorful bras ?
how are you going to spend your next couple of days ?
li na is in a tough match right now . if she makes it through , how would you describe her game and the challenge for you ?
in the good old days you always got to the fourth round , a couple years in the doldrums . you seem to do better when rory is not about .
it 's a question .
is it just coincidence ?
it 's been a month or so from the french open when you went out first round . are you in a better place mentally ?
you 've described your friendship with serena . what about venus ? what sort of an example has venus been to younger players on the tour ?
the dress code , are you aware of any disquiet within the locker room about the strict enforcement of the white rule ?
you 're in the second week now . you will have a chance of winning .
a better chance of winning . do you feel the public out there are rooting for you given one or two things that have gone on recently ? also , do you feel that would be a nice reward for showing dignity and class for offthecourt issues ?
as a liverpool fan , what do you think of suarez 's ban ?
can you talk about ana at all , her game ?
what do you think she needs to improve the most ?
how would you compare the state of your game today and your level of confidence with when you were no.1 in the world ?
what do you think you 'll take away ? what are your feelings about your singles run here and today 's match ?
what are your feelings about the three matches you played here and the week you 've had ?
was it our imagination or did you look a bit emotional at the end ? thought maybe that was a sign you might not come back . but you 'll be back next year playing here again ?
yeah .
you do n't mean
how much can you enjoy the battle of two former champions here going toetotoe with so few chances like you said ?
sounds like even though you came out with a loss , the level you sustained through a lot of that match has you reinvigorated coming out here ?
you sound generally invigorated about your level coming out of the tournament , even though it 's disappointing to lose ?
you mentioned playing more matches . what is your summer plan ?
are you thinking of adding another tournament ?
are you amused by the fact that you 've played well this year , you won dubai , you played a pretty intense match , that people are always trying to retire you ?
in 10 years of covering wimbledon , black fans specifically come to watch you and your sister play . i want to know if you are aware of that and how that made you feel ? you 've made sw19 a more inclusive place .
black here .
when you first emerged on the tour in oakland , there was a big , big hoopla about you . what is more weird or strange , the big buildup early in your career or what you just said ?
the treatment in the media .
would you consider joining serena and playing stanford ?
14 years after your first title here , how do you summon the fortitude to play a match like that with such intensity ?
i know you would n't continue playing if you did n't think you could win . do you think you have another grand slam title within you ?
have you gotten better over the course of your career at taking positives out of defeats ?
kimiko date krumm has put her remarkable longevity down to eating a sushi diet , getting a lot of sleep . what is the secret to your longevity ?
a few minutes ago you said you 've learned from your losses . what have you learned from the loss today and recent losses even when you 're playing so well about what level you can attain now and in the future ?
there was so little sustained momentum for either one of you . was there any one point , maybe in the second set , you were a couple points from taking the match , that you wish you have back ?
one of the most incredible things we have in the sport recently is seeing serena late into grand slams fighting . when you see her doing that , what goes through your mind and what do you think is at the core of that fight ?
petra had almost twice as many unforced errors as you did . is that surprising ?
i think your first serve was like 60 % . if you had been a little bit better today , do you think you would have won ?
i 'm here because i 'm from portugal . i would like to ask you how you could assess what went on in the match today . it was a very nervy start of the match , and then you just flew away with the victory . tell me what happened .
you said you knew what you had to do to win the match . can you specify ?
did it surprise you that in the second set she sort of faded away ?
tough day today obviously . what did you think was not working for you today ?
you 're saying you should have played birmingham or eastbourne ?
how do you see wozniacki 's chances against your opponent ?
how disappointing is this for you ? where do you think you lost the match ?
are you looking forward to getting back to hard courts after clay and grass ?
how much time will you take off before you get back to training ?
why did you make the decision not to play in eastbourne or birmingham ? was that a decision you took personally ?
you obviously had a great start to the year in australia , good in indian wells , miami . how much of the change the last month is surface or anything else ?
you were one of only a few of multiple grand slam winners in the women 's draw . is it a negative for the women 's game to not have repeat slam winners or is it good there 's a lot of different girls in with a chance of winning ?
barbora made the final in birmingham . what was she doing well particularly today ?
you went to the net quite a bit and it did n't work out all the time . was that execution or decision making , do you think ?
if you got through the tiebreak , do you think you would have gone on to win the match ?
that was a pretty great match between two players who obviously know how to play on that court . what were your thoughts on it and how you managed to get the win ?
your rise the last few years came at a time when she was starting to decline . she 's working her way back . is it still something special to be able to play her ?
you saw the caliber she had today . do you think she can come back and win another grand slam ? she won a tournament this year . but does she have that level back ?
through your first three matches , how pleased are you with how well you 're playing right now ?
how pleased are you with how all the czechs are playing ?
i guess you 'll continue to warm up with her ?
how much difference does it feel playing somebody like venus , a great champion , when she 's playing that level ? inside your own head , is it much more intense than against some other player ?
is this the best match you played since the year you won ?
yes .
going back to the czech success here at wimbledon , including tomas as well . how much of that is because back in the czech republic , you grow up playing on quick , indoor surfaces ? is that a common theme , do you think ?
you really showed you wanted to win the game today . i wonder how much the crowd helped you at crucial points in the game .
you had almost twice as many unforced errors as venus .
is there any concern about like an emotional letdown after this match , or do you have so much experience at this point that you 're not too worried about , i beat venus , now i have to play somebody who is not venus ? is that going to be difficult ?
pat cash has spoken about some female players having to play without their bras on , the color of their underwear contravene wimbledon rules . what are your thoughts about that ?
what happened in the second set ? did n't look like you were enjoying yourself .
what will you need to do better in the next match ?
my question is also about belinda bencic . also a very talented junior wimbledon champion . how do you prepare for a match like that ?
again about bencic . you have been sort of like a young , upandcoming player . now you 're no.3 in the world and you are going to face a player that is way younger than you . maybe she has nothing to lose against you .
was the match today decided by those two set points you had at 4all ?
how positive do you feel of the results you 've had here , the run you 've had here ?
with your game , do you think you can be very successful on grass ?
can i ask you about andy murray 's tweet saying that you could be a no.1 ? i 'm sure you 've been asked about it before . did it put pressure on you ?
did you ever talk to him about it ?
so you felt that expectation came too early for you ?
but now you 've grown into it ?
first of all , congratulations . you 're for the first time in the third round of a grand slam . do you feel any kind of pressure today , or did you want just to enjoy the moment , your tennis , and so on ?
can you believe that you won the juniors last year and now you 're in the third round of the ladies tournament ? that 's a very quick progression . is that something that surprised you ?
belinda , we know that you 've worked with melanie molitor . have you been in touch with her here ? if so , what has she told you ?
and through any of that communication have you ever been in touch and martina hingis ?
how much of a better player do you feel you are now compared with one year ago ?
is that the main difference , being consistent ?
maybe you could talk a little bit about the big group of young girls coming through . you played duval today who is 18. there seem to be lots of you who are doing very well at a young age . is it an exciting time to be involved with women 's tennis with this new group ?
now it 's tomorrow and it 's halep . that 's another dimension . is it dream to now go against somebody ...
24 hours only between today . is it mentally everything is okay ?
how do you set your expectations now ? playing someone like halep , you want to go out there and play your best , but is this match you expect to win ? and moving forward , matches like this , are these ones you expect to win in the future ?
you obviously enjoy playing on grass a lot . do you think that this will be your best grand slam ?
you feel as comfortable on hard courts or clay ?
how old were you when you first played on grass ?
what did you think ? because this is a very different surface from all the other surfaces .
sorry to ask you this again , but do you feel like you 're a torch bearer for swiss tennis and the history of patty snyder and martina hingis ? you 're really sort of the next generation . do you feel extra pressure in that sense ?
immediate postmatch thoughts positive or a case of what might have been ?
( indiscernible . )
what do you think when you walk out at the start on such a grand court and it 's barely half full and people are not there for you ? we thought for a brit of all people the place would 've been rocking .
you said you were a bit disappointed with your performance in the first set . what do you put that down to ?
how hard is it i mean , you 're british no.1 . laura sadly is out for quite a bit . how hard is it to be the player who perhaps is the nearest hope we have to keeping andy murray company sort of into the latter stages of the tournament ?
people take a break after nadal . it was about a set and a half before . must have been a good lunch . when they finally got out and got cheering behind you in the second set , you seemed to have momentum . can you take that set in isolation and say that 's what i want it to be at wimbledons to come ?
not sure if you seen julien hoferlin 's comments about british players being too spoiled , do you feel that 's fair ? is there something in the funding system that makes his comments valid ?
what is the difference then , do you think , between heroic failures here for brits and going the extra mile to be able to beat players like this ?
so you need to learn to be ruthless in that respect ?
it must be frustrating , like you say , because you talked before about being more attacking anyway generally recently . is the most important thing you can maybe learnthen you said you were a bit tentative to start with . is the thing to do just go for it and play that tennis you 've talked about ?
how proud are you of coming back to be where you are now ?
you obviously at a young age took yourself off to the img academy . it 's known as a pretty hard school . are you surprised sometimes when you look at other british players , by no means all of them , but some of the british players that perhaps some of them that do n't share your work ethic . does it surprise you that they 're not taking advantage of the opportunity they 've been given , like you 're doing your best to do ?
you said that you took julien hoferlin 's point about some players being too spoiled . not everyone . when you see those players not taking advantage of a great opportunity like you 've tried to do , does that kind of surprise you ?
you mentioned before your firstround match that you did n't sleep so well . how were your preparations for today ?
given the quality of the opposition , given the setting , given sort of the intensity of the atmosphere , was the second set as good as you 've played in your career ?
sports psychology has been quite trendy this summer . what do you do to get yourself mentally right , and have you changed your approach to that ?
what was the tip then ? you 've not yet beaten a top10 player . how were you told to overcome that hurdle ? may be a mental as well as physical barrier .
comments about coaches letting players slip and slide and that sort of thing , do you not think will we not see much of an advancement in british tennis unless the attitude changes ?
will you be wearing your lucky dress again , or is it now unlucky ?
in your first tournament on grass you won your first two matches easily . how much does it mean for you in terms of confidence ?
how have you found the court conditions this year compared to last year ?
it seems like the field has been a pretty good transition as well . have n't seen a lot of upsets this week where last year we had a lot of upsets , like in paris this year .
what are your thoughts about playing alison ?
before the tournament started , many people were pointing to the possibility of a matchup between you and serena . of course you do n't think about it until you 're in that position . what have been your observations of the way serena has played recently and what are the biggest challenges when you see her on her game ?
you share an agent with madison . what do you think about her game and how it might translate to this surface ?
do you feel you 're playing as well as you 've ever played at the moment ?
is there a part of you that hopes for a more difficult match in these early stages to prepare yourself for the battles ahead ?
about the world cup , have you been following it ?
if your country are n't going to win it , do you then put your allegiance to another country ?
have you worked on taking your tea breaks at different times to avoid missing the goals ?
i thought you scheduled your press conference for halftime .
good match today . you won . third round of wimbledon again . how does that feel to be back winning matches on grass ?
was it just the knee you were feeling ?
you play mademoiselle bouchard in the next round . she seems to be a strongwilled individual .
what do you take from charleston , which was a close match ?
does your mindset change ? you go through the first couple rounds ; you 're generally the favorite ; people expect you to win . now you 're going up against a player that is seeded higher . does your mindset change at all ? maybe less pressure ?
before the tournament you spoke very warily about grass . you played very well . what is it that you find difficult ?
so you did rather better against her on grass than on clay a little earlier this year . what are the reasons for that today ?
the gap has been closing with the surfaces to be sort of level . have you found it 's less of an adjustment to play on all the surfaces ?
do you still prefer grass , or do you not like to think of it that way ?
how do you feel about repeating last year 's successes here ? are you confident now ?
one last question on the surface : are the adjustments you talk about more subtle ? you do n't change your game from surface to surface much , do you ?
must be relieved to get the match done before the rain came . were you hurrying a little bit in the last game ?
going into the third set , how were you feeling physically ? you talked about the transition coming from eastbourne to here . did you feel it going to a third set that her chances were better than yours ?
how were you able to do that ? in the tiebreaker there was a dip in your level . she was going into the third with a lot of momentum . what did you tell yourself ?
i suppose you matched up well against her , like your basics were going to be good enough to beat her . you have a very different game . it was decided on your racquet , it looked like .
how would you describe your comfort level with the aura of wimbledon , all that means , how it 's changed as you 've gained experience here ?
how so ?
you mentioned you were n't playing your best . is that reassuring looking forward to the next round , possibly next week ? is it nice to know you have that level you can step up to ?
what do you attribute this run you 've gotten onto on grass in terms of getting your game together ?
what effect on your confidence is your serve ?
how would you compare it with all the other women 's serves tour at this present time ?
whose do you look up to ?
what particularly about it perhaps have you tried to emulate ?
how and how hard is it for you to focus on the process and not focus on results ?
there 's a lot of green at wimbledon . anything to match your sofa just yet ?
do n't you have like a very , very green sofa at home ?
this is the third time you 've reached the third round at a major . is there a feeling for you now that it 's time to take the next step and go one better ? is that a particular motivator for you ?
how different do you feel about yourself as a player with a title under your belt ?
did you chase down any of those one direction guys that were wandering around ?
there was a story about you being inspired by venus williams and wanting a dress like venus ' when you were a kid . is that how you got into tennis ? was it looking up to the williams sisters ? were they the inspiration for you ?
what does it mean to you that she has won a couple of times here , and with all that she 's been through physically is on a run again at wimbledon ?
when you say venus is amazing for the game , what do you mean by that ?
was it a tougher match than expected ?
how far do you feel heather maybe can go when she gets back to full fitness ?
your next match on saturday will be against kirsten flipkens . what are your feelings about that ?
heather probably had the crowd behind her today . what effect did that have on you ?
can you explain how you feel your game is on the grass .
was there a point in the third set where you thought , i 've got it now ?
were the conditions hard at all ? watching it felt like it was quite windy . did that have an effect with people dropping serve ?
two years ago you beat kim clijsters in the fourth round . how do you compare flipkens to kim clijsters on grass ?
do you think it would be tougher to beat kirsten than to beat kim , who was n't so great on grass ?
you saw what happened to sabine in the final last year . how confident are you about your mental strength ?
do you watch world cup ?
you 're creeping up the rankings once again . it 's been commonly said , usually by journalists that probably is n't true , that you found it difficult being at the top end of the rankings when you were there some years ago . is that true ? this time , are you ready for what looks like a continuous rise maybe back to no.1 ?
what experience did you get from this year 's wimbledon ? how did you feel about today and your experience ?
will you come back next year to wimbledon with any new ideas of how to play , or just it was a bad day ?
there 's a slight difference between the way you started the match and finished the match . would you agree with that ?
can you figure out what it is inside you that enables you to finally click ?
you felt that you played better than the first match ? how would you assess your level of play compared to the first match ?
when you have an error , you almost always stop at the baseline , put your hands on your hips , look down . is that an attempt to collect yourself and move on or give yourself a talking to and then moving on ?
has it been a particular source of pride that you 've been able to take your strengths to each surface now ?
would you say adjustments that you make are very subtle , then , from surface to surface ?
you meet petkovic in the next round . you had a heartbreaking match against her in charleston . what do you think about that match , being on grass ?
were you surprised by the court selection ? do you feel you 've become more popular here at wimbledon ?
what do you remember of playing petkovic at the rogers cup ?
how much potential do you think you have to become a better grass court player as the years go on ?
does it make much of a difference to you that the crowds , you might as well be in church compared to australia with the chants ?
any issues with slipping ?
canadian tennis has seemed to have come on in the last few years . what do you put that down to ?
how hard was it to wait ? how was everything in terms of waiting and waiting ?
did you watch the tsonga match as well ?
could you walk us through your match , how you felt .
bathroom breaks . how often do you take them ? how often do your opponents take them ? what are your general feelings about their use ?
are they misused at all as a strategy to regroup , get your thoughts ?
how much confidence can this victory give you ?
you 're in decent form now .
do you feel this could be your best year here ?
what 's the difference psychologically coming into a tournament when you 're the hunted , no.1 in the world , that position , versus quite a bit back in the pack ?
you and serena williams are obviously great friends . if venus ever wanted a day off , would you like to be serena 's doubles partner ? what kind of a doubles team do you think you would make ?
what sort of feedback did you get from your comments yesterday that laid some things out there , about your personal life ?
when you were asked about dating , things of that nature . what sort of feedback did you get from people you care about about having been that open about things ?
in my opinion that was a good game today , classy game from a classy lady . on a scale of 1 to 10 , how would you describe it ?
at any point were you worried ?
what reason was it that you were late for the start of the match ?
yes .
there was no reason , no delay ?
it was suggested there might have been a change of apparel .
it was n't a story of you having to change an item of your clothing because it was colored or anything ?
it was a suggestion .
both you and serena have talked about the upcoming olympics in a couple years . looking ahead , i 'm wondering , when you come out to play here , having been here so many years , do you ever think , this might be my last singles match at wimbledon or do you not think that way ?
it 's been a while since you and serena were both in the second week of a major . when you are together in singles in the second week of a major , what 's it like for you ?
so if you are in the second week here , what do you think that will be like for you ?
what would that mean to you ?
a number of players this week are talking about art . you 've taken art classes . talk about your approach to art . are you more into color or design , favorite artists ?
in traveling the world , your favorite art museum you went to was ?
it 's been a while since you made it to the third round of a slam . i know you want more . does this still feel like a good step in the right direction ?
possibility you might play kvitova the third round .
as someone who has a career in design , what is your opinion of these two weeks of year , they are going predominantly white , do you think it 's a nice change , is it boring ? what is your assessment ?
what is it in particular you like about wimbledon when you walk through the door ? what 's the one thing you really like ?
if you were granted a wish for another grand slam title , would it be here because of your great history here or perhaps the us open because that 's the home country ?
your hairdo is very west african .
this is very west african .
what are your thoughts on the decision ahead for lebron james and his move to opt out this week ?
what would you like to see him do ?
from what you just said , you 've said in the past you have your sights on going to brazil in 2016. what is important for you about the olympics and where do you stand right now on fed cups ?
it 's three .
what is it about the olympics that you want to have another experience ?
with everything you 've been through , would it have been easier for you to just say , i 'm finished with tennis ? what keeps you going ?
you 're the oldest player left in the women 's draw . when you look around at the other girls on the tour , do you feel it ?
some people have suggested that you might at some point transition to just playing doubles . is that something you would ever actually consider ?
no , not now . at any point down the road .
would you consider becoming a coach ?
congratulations .
what does it feel like to get back on center court , first of all ?
compared to other tournaments , because there is so much history at that particular court , how much more important is it to be on the main stadium at wimbledon than maybe another tournament ?
what is it about wimbledon that brings out the best in your game , do you think ?
you won in quite emphatic fashion , and the crowd were really gasping with excitement at some of the shots you were playing . how much does that give you as a player when you know the crowd are behind you and like the type of tennis you play ?
wimbledon only schedules one women 's match for centre per day and two men . what do you think about that ? the women get fewer chances to play there .
how bad was your injury today ?
how was the match for you ? did you feel you were in there and you might have won it but for the injury ?
what about venus ? a very big star , a big name . what was it like today being out there at wimbledon with venus ?
she 's very big and you 're very small .
how did you find facing the serve ?
did you feel having won the first three games you should have gone on to win the first set ?
you were saying i gave it my all the two times you served for the match , and then we were interrupted . would you like to develop that ?
having turned it round so well in the tiebreak last night , did you want to carry on ?
by that , i mean do you feel you had the momentum when play was stopped last night ?
do you have any idea why you lost your momentum when you served for the match twice ?
first time i saw you play . impressive . what do you think you need to do to step up ? is it serve ? is it conditioning ? something else ? you clearly got a great forehand and a really aggressive game .
you mentioned in the other room about the positives you 'll take rather than regrets from today . what would they be ?
i 'm sure you were n't counting the fist pumps during the game , but there was a special motivation for them , was n't there ?
you have any idea how much you 've raised ?
do you normally fist pump ?
it 's already a fantastic legacy for bally , is n't it , in a very short space of time ?
can you tell us what your next month involves ?
go back to yorkshire ?
doncaster ?
you said your ranking will be better by the time you return . have you set yourself a specific target ?
did you learn something today about how to fight those big points ?
how much will the prize money help your career ?
on a scale of 1 to 10 today , how would you describe your game ? good or very good ?
do you see yourself going all the way to the finals ?
the first set of your first round was shaky . since then do you feel calmer , more comfortable ?
you have a journalism degree ?
do you ever sit up there and think about if you were sitting here you 'd ask better questions ?
do you have a burning desire to be a journalist after you get done ?
were you a little concerned about the number of unforced errors you made today , 21 i think ?
you had 33 winners . but 21 is a lot of unforced errors from you .
did you ever feel it was a cause for concern that you were missing the lines as often as you hit them ?
what are your thoughts about being the no.2 seed but being put on the outer courts ?
does n't bother you to be on a smaller court ?
does that change your routine if you 're playing first rather than if you were put on at 3:00 in the afternoon ?
is there anybody you would not like to meet before the finals ? anybody that worries you or scares you ?
does n't worry you who you meet ?
you 're having more fun with carlos as your coach and your husband kind of along ? is that easier for you ?
has he stopped snoring ?
you play barbora zahlavova strycova next . do you have thoughts on that match ?
which is your favorite , grass or clay ?
grass not at all , not interested in grass ?
but hard court is for you ?
so very good performance . must be pleased with how you 're playing so far .
over the last year you seem to have played three sets every match . how important is it early in the grand slams to keep it quick ?
when did you start realizing you were playing a lot of threeset matches ?
when did it really sort of kick in ?
which was ?
you like that ?
what about venus next round ? how do you see that ?
i know you love grass , but why is it as soon as you arrive here , does n't matter what your form has been , you click into gear ?
how is your leg ?
so did it feel good from the outset today , or did it take a while to get warmed up ?
do you have any superstitions here ? do you do the same things you did in previous years ? same restaurants ? stay in the same house ?
same room ?
is it the biggest one ?
so no superstitions , but it makes you feel comfortable ?
do you watch tv ?
can you describe your thoughts on the way venus williams is playing and the keys to a matchup with her for you ?
what about the history between you ? when you have played her , what 's been the deciding point or the deciding aspect in your matches ?
did you watch venus winning wimbledon growing up ?
how much did the anxiety levels reach last night when you found out you were on main court first up ?
in the end , was the experience better than the performance ?
the second set .
what did you take out of the day as a whole ?
in the second set you tended to get back with a bit of power serving and really teeing off on her . is that what you wanted to do , kill her with the power ?
as you look at the grass court season over the last few weeks , do you feel like you 've taken a significant step forward ?
how difficult is it a situation to back up with doubles after ? there was n't a long distance between . was it good to get out and have another hit ?
there was a lot of interest in the doubles . the court was packed . what was it like ?
do you feel the way you 're playing over the next couple of years at majors , things like fourth rounds , maybe even further , is really achievable ?
given that you did n't play much after wimbledon last year , would you be disappointed if you 're not seeded by the us open ?
where are you playing post wimbledon ?
what does our team have to do to beat collingwood this week ?
did you enjoy that while it lasted , and did you just wish it had gone on a bit longer ?
was that a conscious decision to go sort of on the offensive ?
did you enjoy the sort of , how should we phrase it , appreciation from the crowd at times ?
was the highlight the ace that you dedicated to you 're new admirer ?
five .
perhaps it 's my lip reading that 's awry , but you seemed to say sorry to caroline at the net at the end ?
you 're taking this very well . obviously you clearly would 've wanted to win . what can you learn from the overall experience of the two rounds ?
will you look at a full time coach at any point ?
who do you need to do ? is that a funding issue again ?
before the match , did you view her as a sort of potential scout given i guess her record in slams this you 're has been slightly patchy ?
do you feel like you got a lot off your chest on monday after you spoke about the lta funding ? did that help you go into the game today sort of fearless ?
no develops on that front in the past 24 hours in the term of olive branches ?
what will the most important things be for you now to take the steps you want to ?
given it 's only your fourth match back .
was there any level which you felt satisfied today in general ?
at eastbourne you said you were missing timing because you had n't had match practice . was it more that , lacking that sharpness ?
what are your thoughts on your opponent 's level of play today and her game in general ?
in terms of coming back , how much do you need match play in order to get sharper ?
do you think you need matches most of all to get back to where you want to be ?
i suppose the disadvantage is it 's such a short grass court season . was it more about getting back on the tour and back into the process of playing ?
you say you have a lot of work to do . do you feel it 's small margins between where you want to be ?
when you 're in the middle of it , is it hard to be patient , know that it 's going to take a little time to get back ?
physically how do you think you are right now ? do you think match fitness , endurance you have to build up ?
are you someone who is very hard on yourself ? that 's quite a critical analysis you had of your game .
did you not watch tennis over the time you were n't playing ?
you 're coming into a big part of the season for you , the u.s. hard court , defending a title in cincinnati . how big is it for you to start playing the way you want to ?
do you have any idea what you expect for yourself ?
after having gone through an injury and coming back , athletes have more of an appreciation when they do that . do you have that feeling now ? it was a long stretch to be out .
do you feel it will be harder to get back to world no.1 than it was for you to reach it ?
that was all fairly quick today .
feel good ?
talking about next round , what do you know about your nextround opponent ?
you know nothing about her at all ?
tall ?
long hair ?
you know her background ?
it 's quite an interesting story .
yesterday 's papers .
she got ditched by the lta about five or six years ago as a teenager and made her way on her own .
full of fight . full of fire .
you had a disappointing result at the french which came very shortly after your very public breakup . did that affect your play at the time and how have you managed to bounce back ?
what are your thoughts on the way the world cup is unfolding and to what degree have you had a chance to take it in ?
you mentioned some teams have surprised you . who are some of those ?
what is your sense about what the world cup means to the world ?
you talked this week about moving on and finding a new man . have you considered internet dating ?
you seem to have a great admirer in feliciano lpez ?
he told us . he said he watched two of your matches , likes you , admires you , knows your dad .
then he followed you on court today .
what does your friendship with serena williams mean to you and in what ways has she mentored you recently ?
what do you think the perception is of her ? the public sees her as the competitor on the court . what 's the reality ?
in what ways ? what makes her so amazing as a friend ?
do you feel the rain delay helped or hindered you ? what did you think of your opponent 's performance ?
long first game , but after that you seemed to get your feet under you pretty well . how important was that first game ? did it settle you down any ?
with venus having played really well , as well , what would it be like for the two of you to advance here into the second week , as in years past ?
what are your observations of the way venus is playing right now ?
you play another american in the next round potentially . christina mchale , what do you know about her game ?
the usa plays germany tomorrow . what is your thought on the game and the world cup right now ?
a couple of slips out there for both players . concerning for you at this stage of the tournament ?
motivation is such a curious thing . could you talk about what motivates you ? is it the history books , the big picture , something within you ? what really motivates you ?
having setbacks is something that really advances you in the long run ?
with all the success you and your sister have had here , all the titles you have won , obviously what you do is working . i 'm curious why you 've never played grass court warmup tournaments . did it ever occur to you ?
but it 's not something you do regularly the way a lot of other players do . i 'm wondering why that came about .
when did you get here this time ?
when you 're moving on to the grass , getting ready for this surface , what for you is the most difficult part of getting used to the grass ?
when you 're sitting there watching the heat struggle so much against the spurs , do you reflect on that ? do you relate it to your athleticism , times when you have trouble kicking into gear ?
you might be able to relate to that ?
after paris , how long did it take you to regroup and get refocused and remotivated ?
you were just asked about the miami heat . what are your thoughts about lebron james opting out and keeping his options open ? what would you like to see happen ?
what message would you like to send to him ?
what do you like best about this tournament and about london ?
and about london ?
let 's milk this nba thing . what about shaq ? he was here . a huge guy , playful and fun . have you ever talked with him ?
you said a little while ago it 's too early to talk about week two . how about reflecting back , when you and venus are both in the second week playing at your best in the tournament late , what is the feeling you get because venus is there with you ?
assume you 've seen the recent beats video you make an appearance in .
talk about making that .
tennis , as a free agent , you kind of get to do what you want ?
how often do you decide to do that ?
it was so cool when you played stanford after working so hard here . your heart set on playing it again ?
are you playing montral ?
must have been delighted with that because she was firing bombs the whole match .
you have had such a good run recently . how important was it for you to get a win at wimbledon with everybody looking ?
what causes that eating thing ? is it like a tension that you get before ?
you spoke in eastbourne about the sleeplessness . has that been a problem this week ?
are there other manifestations when you get nervous apart from your jaw locking and sleeping ?
does it get easier when you get a win ? do you sleep a bit easier the night after ?
i think you had a couple of breakpoints against you in the second game of the second set . you fought very well . do you think that was a crucial game or did you feel you had the match in hand then ?
she blew radwanska away in paris . did you see she was walking back towards her chair , shaking her head ? did you think you had broken her will ?
laura was the nation 's sweetheart when she made it into the second week last year . did you feel the love out there today ? this is a hometown girl .
kerber has just won , so that 's who you 're going to play next . you had your first top20 win in eastbourne , so first top10 win . is that in the cards , do you think ?
throughout your development , you have very much done your own thing . gone to bollettieri 's very young . looking at the three brits who are definitely through to the next round , andy similarly kind of done his own thing , naomi done her own thing , do you think that 's a coincidence that you have kind of been selfsufficient through your career and maybe not part of a wider system ?
how important is it for british tennis and british women 's tennis in particular that it 's not just andy murray going through to the second round of big tournaments like this ?
that tension that you talked about , does that go as soon as you start playing or start knocking up or does it take a little while ?
what about today ?
i just wondered , has the lta ever asked you what they can do better to suit a player like yourself who has gone abroad , if there is , as part of that , an attempt to improve the whole development of british tennis ?
i just wondered if they had ever asked you why you chose florida so they could learn perhaps what a young player wants ?
did you get the chance to sort of see any of naomi yesterday , and how well do you know her ?
you 've got a victory on the green grass of home under your belt . are you more convinced than ever now that grass is very suited to your new , aggressive approach ?
slightly shaky start , but fairly comfortable after that .
what did you make of samantha 's attempt to blast you away from the first point ?
you struggled with your serve in the first two or three service games , but once you broke and were 41 up , it went pretty well . troubles with the service due to the new environment and different surface ?
after what happened last year , was it just important to get a victory , to kind of settle things down , get on to the roll of being back in wimbledon in the tournament ?
and the form that you carry into wimbledon , can that be any help ? obviously a different surface , but can you take anything from that ?
you were pictured traveled by tube to or from queen 's last week . what do you make of the public transport in england these days ?
do you ever travel to wimbledon on public transport ?
how about someday taking the subway to the us open ?
with it being 10 years , does it make you more determined that you owe yourself a second wimbledon ?
it 's tough for people , men or women , to execute the double from france to wimbledon . having won on both , what do you think coming over here ? is it such a great change that that year you ca n't do it or is there an easier transition ?
many have spoken about this incredible love of competition that you have that seems so natural to you . could you talk about that . does the competition take you to a new level as a person ? is it something that you learn from ? why do you love it so much ?
when you turn your back to the court and think for just a moment , is that a pep talk to yourself ? what is your internal dialogue at that point ?
what are the biggest differences between the court conditions early in the tournament here and late ? what are the pros and cons from your perspective ?
which do you prefer in terms of the show courts , early in the tournament or late , and why ?
how different is your wimbledon experience now 10 years later than when you first came as a teenager with regard to your time away from the court ?
you walked around wimbledon a couple weeks ago , photos of you . can you do that during wimbledon fortnight or are you confined to barracks because there are so many fans around ?
you were the quickest winner of the day today .
on grass , which is not your favorite .
how are you feeling on this stuff this year ?
how much of that is a function of your success in paris that you come in with that kind of attitude ?
it must feel fantastic that you are so clearly coming back to your best again . top 20. how exciting is it ?
did you come really close to quitting ?
you do n't think that now .
no moon walking anymore ?
was there a point where that did stop ? have i missed it , or ...
who designed your clothes today ?
because i am british can i ask you what you think about mauresmo coaching andy murray ?
you watching much of the world cup ?
portugal .
i was going to say , you 're not rooting for the usa against germany .
so you 're ignorance is bliss for the u.s. ? that they do n't know ...
that was a tough match for you . that missed volley in the fourth game at the start of the first set , is that shot still in your mind ?
in a parallel universe you could have won the first four games . they were all very tight .
you hit some fantastic first shots there . is that something you could take from today and look again on the video ?
what is it like being out there , massive arena like that ? is it pretty hard to take in ?
there were a few comments on twitter about your black ankle supports . can you tell us why you chose that color ?
who have you watched here then as a fan ?
the opportunity to be where you really want to be then , it 's got to be huge ?
as well as being the classiest player you 've ever played against , is she the loudest , as well ? much is made of sharapova 's volume , shall we say .
the circumstances when you came as a fan to court1 , were you here with friends or school or something ?
when you walked into the accreditation office back in 2007 , did you handle sharapova 's pass at all ?
you attended northwestern for four years and graduated ?
pretty rare that a woman attends a u.s. college plays at this level . why did you decide to go there ?
anyone else in the college ranks that are playing pros that you competed against ?
you mentioned having gone to northwestern . what are your thoughts about the football players and the union effort that 's going on there ?
what are your thoughts as far as college athletes and whether there should be changes in the system for them ?
what single memory will you take away from today ? what pleased you most about the hour you were on court today ?
you went for it , did n't you , in terms of your groundstrokes ?
does that whet the appetite to stay this high in the rankings ?
acing sharapova , is that the sort of memory that can carry you through some of those backwater tournaments ?
what does 27,000 mean to someone like you ? it 's more than total prize money in some events you 've played .
where are you scheduled next to play ?
when you 're making decisions about those things , how much of it is moneydriven to make the books balance ?
have you had to make any compromises in the past ? it can be quite hard , ca n't it ?
what was your job ?
when you got back out there , did it feel like you 'd never left ?
nervous why ?
is that about defending points ?
how would you say your year has gone here the 12 months since the final ?
how much better do you feel on grass ?
when you won your first match back , does it relax you or next round you 'll still have the same nerves ?
is there one particular thing you remember most about last year of all the things ?
marion says she still watches clips on youtube . have you done the same at all ?
so this was an opponent who has beaten you a couple times . what was your mindset going in to the match ?
so what have you been doing since saturday ?
physically at the end of eastbourne were you feeling okay or feeling the effects of a tournament ?
is there a difference now knowing that , not that you did not know you could win a tournament , but just having been there , is there a whole different level of confidence ?
are the courts here different than how they felt in eastbourne ? when you started hitting yesterday , did it feel weird ?
just in time .
are you getting a lot of congratulations and stuff from people ? are people generally happy for you ?
does your preparation or what you 're doing here at wimbledon this time around , is it different than playing slams before or even compared to wimbledons in the past ? do you feel like the experience of playing slams and enough tournaments and now winning a tournament that it 's changed how you 're kind of playing your way through this ?
is there a specific goal that you have kind of either the rest of year or just this tournament now that you 've kind of established this high standard for yourself ?
winning a title can feel like getting a monkey of the back or it 's a milestone you can finally check off . are there other milestones that are like that , oh , i want to get my first blah , blah , blah win ?
please do that . there was n't a radar clock on court today , so we did n't know how fast you served . you were really serving hard in eastbourne . did you feel like it was up there ?
you 're obviously a great hope for the future of u.s. tennis . did you feel under pressure in that way ?
have you ever practiced with taylor or hit with her at all ? how well do you know her ?
yeah . so you 're pretty familiar with each other 's games . potentially could play in the next round .
what are your thoughts on that ?
d.c. and chicago .
yeah .
she 's on right now .
what is it about her ball that makes it so difficult ? we 've seen so many players when they first hit with taylor they ca n't read the ball . is it just the lefty spin , or is there something else going on ?
who is the coach ?
do you talk to her about kind of just the whole lifestyle and the expectations ? do you guys have those kind of talks ever ?
is it weird then like if you 're so focused and you 're playing matches , tournaments , and going from city to city , whatever , and then you come into these press conferences and you get these questions and you 're like , why do they care about this ? i did n't realize they were paying attention to that ?
when you do win , though , how intoxicating is that ?
can you remember how many tournaments , juniors and seniors , that you finished without losing a match ? in other words , how many have you won , how many weeks you 've had ?
a bit cold out there , otherwise is that the perfect start ?
how is the shoulder ?
the draw seems a little kinder this year than previous years . is that a chance to set record straight at wimbledon ?
does it feel different being seeded here , particularly so high this year compared to previous years ?
do you have a goal or expectation from the next couple of weeks ?
you had indicated earlier this week you knew it was going to be a challenging match because of her experience and her skill on grass . was she as you expected her to be ?
how did you feel about the way the first set ended ? did you see the ball out ?
when you say you did n't play well , what does that mean ?
after paris you said that grass is probably your favorite surface . coming into the tournament , you did n't have a lot of matches under your belt . how do you feel you are prepared for a grand slam on grass ?
you 've drawn your share of attention in the buildup to this tournament for good reasons . do you feel pressure at this point ?
was the crowd more subdued than you would have expected ?
the reason i ask is you did n't appear to have many of the little toys thrown on at the end . did you have any today ?
would you like it to build through the week ?
do you remember the last time you played on that court ?
what do you know about espinosa ?
i 'm sure you 'll tell me you 're just focusing on one game at a time , but in the back of your mind , are you aware you 're moving towards that fourthround meeting with serena williams ?
what is the simple difference between the kind of tennis you played , how you thought about it on clay a couple weeks ago , and the tennis you 're playing now on grass ?
who did you have the best practice session with before the tournament ?
you lost the second set on sort of a fluke let cord thing . i know you 're trying to save energy and not play three sets . how do you come back from that kind of frustration ?
how did it feel to get back to winning ways at wimbledon ?
does it give you confidence to have gotten through quite a tough first set , especially on grass , a surface that you love ?
you looked like your strength is fine , like you 've gotten it back . you did an interview with a magazine about the syndrome you had , how difficult it was , how tired you 'd get . how do you fight back from that and how was it even diagnosed ? i researched it and it 's a strange kind of thing .
did it take them a long time for them to figure it out ?
you 're treating it in such a way you feel like your strength is back ?
is it still the same coming back every year ? is it different now ?
if you can think back to a year ago , what was it like for you not to be at wimbledon ? how much did you pay attention at all to the tournament ?
what was that feeling like ? every year in june you come here . it was the first time you were n't able to come and play .
you 've spoken in terms of your work as being in the tradition of billie jean in terms of equal opportunity , equal pay . when you heard that this scottish guy , andy murray , hired amlie to be his coach , what were your thoughts ?
just wondering what the body issue shoot was like ? sounds like in the article that was attached that you were surprised that it was going to be like that .
was it fun ?
over the years you and serena and other women who have had great records here have been put on the outer courts a lot . tomorrow 's schedule came out and there 's two women 's matches on centre court and court no.1 .
you were involved in the prize money discussions here . was the court placement also something that you were involved with or the wta council , to your knowledge ?
back to the body issue . how were you approached to do this and why did you do it ?
do you have any idea about your next opponent ?
so when you play someone you know almost nothing about , do you usually try to find out about your opponent or just go out and stick to your tennis ?
how frustrating is it that the courts are so much slower here than they were when you first played here ?
you said wimbledon always listened . have you made that point and do they listen ?
is it possible to go into a tournament or match and think you 'd like to conserve energy ? is that a dangerous thing to think ?
so many years at this place , so many moments . if you could choose one favorite moment from when you were young or more recently , which one would you choose ?
what was that like ?
when you came off court , you spoke about the need to stay hungry . do you still have that hunger for the titles inside you ? do you think , i 'd love to surprise a few people in this tournament and go as far as you can ?
how do you sum up that experience , that performance ?
you never really got into it , did you , after the first service game ? sort of catchup from there .
is that encouraging with what 's coming ahead in the next few months ?
you said last week it all happened pretty smoothly with miles . were you feeling unsettled at all coming into today ?
you take a bit of time now to think about that situation , what you want for the future ?
you took your time last time getting a coach , a couple of months . did you learn anything from that process that you think you 'll be able to utilize when you 're looking this time ?
do you feel like you know exactly what you need at this stage of your career ?
in the scale of your career , do you walk off today and still think are you still baffled by the whole wimbledon thing , why it does n't work for you here ?
you move on now to the us open . what is your plan in the leadup to the event ?
you 're playing with wickmayer in doubles ?
when you saw the draw , did that give you reason for pause because of the quality of player that maria has been in the past ?
specifically what did she do today to take you out of your game ?
you had a pretty impressive run at grand slams . that streak is snapped .
is there any silver lining you can start to take out of this ?
did you feel like you had regained momentum after serving five match points ?
what is your approach to adversity ?
how are you at that ?
how was your confidence level coming into wimbledon ? was it any different than it was at the french or the aussie ?
what are your hopes or goals for the rest of the year ?
what is your next event ?
you have a block here now to regroup , get back to work . how do you think you 're going to approach that ? what are you going to work on ? is it nice to have that break in the middle of the season ?
you were n't awake watching the world cup ?
have you watched much otherwise ?
you talked about adversity . what 's the toughest part of the tour ? is it in the actual play or other parts of the game that are tough ?
does it feel good when you overcome the adversity ?
you talked about having fun . are you planning on taking some time totally away , vacationing , not being in tennis for a bit ?
what were your thoughts about madison 's win the other day ?
did you feel any pressure from this streak ?
you just referred to coco and madison winning tournaments . in your estimation , what is the state of that next generation of american players ?
what are the obstacles to getting to that next level in terms of winning majors for the group of young players that have followed serena ?
do you have a handle on what you need to or want to improve to take the next step ?
could i get an example or two ?
is there part of you that you did so well so fast at the slams that maybe there was n't enough concentration at the leveldown tournaments ?
how do you know jozy ?
where was that ?
besides a cool kid , how would you describe him now ?
when you saved all those match points in the game , you go into the breaker , the third set is on your racquet , it felt as the whole thing was about to swing . did it seem that way to you ?
how much did you know about your opponent before today ?
how relieved are you to win the match and get one grass match under your belt ?
what have you been doing since the french open ?
no racquet ?
how did that feel ?
why did you feel the pressure ? i know when you spoke at the french open after that match , you said you did n't know why you felt the way that you felt on court . do you now know why ?
earlier in the year you said you have a special relationship with your racquets .
so when you left them and did n't pick them up for weeks , were they pissed ? did they say , why did you do that ?
they get tired of you ?
this is the one major where you do n't have the best results . semifinals everywhere else , or winning . why do you think that is ?
so then do you feel there 's less pressure here on you at wimbledon than maybe the french because you had won the french ? do you feel the same amount of pressure as in paris or less ?
how do you sum up that match ?
you had an injury last week . how are you feeling physically now ?
is there any more pressure on yourself here at wimbledon ?
that must be a very , very satisfying win . first one here at wimbledon . 43,000 ?
who was the little girl you hoisted up at the end ?
how concerned were you about the wrist injury ?
we do n't know your next opponent .
caroline wozniacki or peer .
can i confirm , do you get any lta funding ?
is this actually a big win for british tennis then or not because presumably it 's more about yourself than the lta ?
when did you stop getting funding ?
how tough has that been because of that for you ?
caroline wozniacki will probably be your next opponent . how do you see her as a player ?
will you go and watch the match afterwards ?
back to the funding . do you think that 's made you a hungrier player , made you fight harder for where you got to ?
if 2007 was the low point , today presumably being the best win of your career and high point , talk a little bit about how you felt from the low to the high and how much you feel maybe the lta hung you out to dry a little bit ?
but today is the best win ?
a lot has been made about where the lta go for here , funding for upandcoming players . in this victory for you , if authorities would try to claim credit for that , would that detract from what you 've achieved ?
your father has been coaching you ; is that correct ?
how important has he been to what you 've been able to achieve ?
you said all your money goes into tennis and your career . how do you enjoy yourself ? do you ever have many to go out with friends , buy clothes ?
what bag are you buying ?
has there been any suggestion of a kiss and make up with the lta from either side ?
you 're not getting the coaching , the medical treatment , the sports psychologists and everything else ?
you have none of that at all ?
have you ever been close to giving up because of the money situation ?
are you going tournament by tournament ?
43000
given the absence of the lta funding , have you had to do odd jobs ? is it frustrating to think of how good you could have been if you had lta backing ?
you say you do n't really think about the lta funding so much , but this victory must be sweeter because of this kind of past .
do you think today will finally draw a line under that ? has it made you a lot more cautious about how you go about your life off court ?
is it a blessing in disguise in many ways that you have no association with the lta , that it 's forced you to go your own way ?
the au pair option , was that the first time you really considered just stopping because of the financial problems ? had you thought before then of stopping ?
that would have been a big decision , a heavyhearted decision , or were you getting resigned to that ?
does it bother you you 're called the bad girl ?
the picture .
it was just girls having fun ?
what do you say to people that still bring it up ?
it 's really made you stronger ?
you took a tumble in the tiebreak . did you think at one point you were n't going to go on ?
did you bury a few ghosts out on that court after what happened last year ?
your feelings after all the struggles , the time off the tour to win a slam match ?
what was the ordeal like to be away for you ?
what about the mental side of it ? you mentioned how much you enjoy being on the court . what was it like for your psyche to be off the court all that time ?
you seemed very happy in eastbourne last week despite losing .
how did today compare with last week ?
what was the condition of the grass today versus what you experienced last year ?
why argentina ?
and your nails ?
tennis is sometimes described as a profession , sometimes it 's called a sport , other times it 's called an art . you spoke about learning you had a joy of painting . talk about the joy of your art , dealing with space and color .
last year 's champion is really into art . who are some of your favorite artists ?
you touched on your support of argentina . how about the world cup in general . what does the world cup mean to you and what is your passion for the event ?
do you think wimbledon does that to an extent ?
what goes through your mind when you watch messi ?
