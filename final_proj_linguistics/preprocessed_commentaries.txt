great response from the former world number one
she wraps up the game to ensure that halep must finish the job on her serve
a couple of superb returns from cirstea put the brit under pressure but a stunning forehand down the sideline from watson pulls the game back to cirstea commands a lengthy rally from the baseline on the next point though to bring up the first break point of the match and the brit gives the game away with a double fault

match
good start to the set from azarenka who picks up where she left off with powerful groundstrokes

both players trade winners on the opening two points before muguruza registers her first ace
however serena is warming into this now and a smash helps her reach deuce
the spaniard holds on though when serena makes a couple of mistakes
hmm that was an odd service game from vinci she comes up short on every third ball to hand a break straight back to mladenovic
it is a quick hold for wozniacki
she taking full advantage of kuznetsova lapse in concentration
the russian has not made many more unforced errors in this set but the ones she has made have come on crucial points
wozniacki will be looking for the break now
that not the start to the second set that radwanska wanted
muguruza powers her way to and although radwanska provides a response the spaniard backhand proves too hot to handle
she could run away with this match from here
she a clever one is radwanska
she closes out the game by drawing li into the net and swiping away the volley that is presented to her
that is as good a backhand winner as you likely to see for the next fortnight
sharapova catches it on the and although her opponent is well placed it flies past her for kvitova finally seems to have put her struggles on serve behind her and is making robson pay
the brit is finding it difficult to make good returns against some sensation serves from the eighth seed

venus finally has some success against the injured keys to open up a lead
the replies with an ace but on the next point the seed works keys around the court before the error comes
keys shows tremendous guts to get back to deuce but venus has worked out that she is struggling on the backhand side and that enough to get back in front
the trainer is back out and if keys loses this set i say there is a chance she may pull out but we will see
robson breaks
kirilenko hits her way back to deuce
however crouching down she then pats a backhand into the net to give robson another break point which is converted with a wicked forehand return

the new zealander saves the first but robson shows immense speed to chase down a drop shot to put away the winner
radwanska has another chance to break and this time she does drawing li forward with a slice and the chinese ca whip it over
hmmmm
the pole also breaks to love and that one of the oddest starts you see to a tennis match
expect many more breaks today as neither woman is particularly confident on serve but much better at returning
williams looks in an uncompromising mood as he drills a backhand winner down the line but safarova responds well to get to williams remains in the game with more heavy hitting but safarova comes through with the hold and that shouldsettle any lingering nerves that she may have
very high success rate from stephens at the net and she sets up a first break point with a good approach
a booming forehand later and she back on serve
excellent from the american
these planes just wo go away
it must be distracting the players
muguruza gifts williams a point with a wild backhand which drifts long
the umpire steps in to call the ball out in the next rally and williams who rarely challenges does ask for the technology
they exchange points once again and we hear a first come on from williams
however a double fault brings up break point
muguruza is almost on her knee to force deuce with a backhand which clips the line
she needs to produce some magic again to save break point with a perfectly constructed rally which ends with williams finding the net
the quality is very high
muguruza takes advantage but williams responds with a forehand winner off the second serve
a similar effort produces a third break point
she misses the chance to convert again and muguruza eventually capitalises to hold with another winner
that could be a crucial hold

not a good start from the seventh seed
the double is followed by a careless volley but she manages to hold as li misses a simple forehand of her own at the net
better from sharapova who connects with a return to win the first point but the russian goes just wide in the next point
the pair trade mistakes before serena drills down a ace
a double fault follows but another ace this time at helps the american to the hold
that impeccable length from erakovic who finds the tramline with a forehand
the service barrage continues too as she records her fifth ace to move to robson takes the next point with some aggressive hitting from inside the court but an excellent second serve seals the game for erakovic
she does want to wait any longer kvitova
a really strong service game ends with an angled drop shot that makarova ca get to
we with serve in the third but the momentum is all behind kvitova
kvitova has had some success at the net today despite using her shots there sparingly
she comes in for a volley early in this game though helping her to a lead

ivanovic finishes a superb game with an ace and takes the set at the same time
marvellous tennis
the pole saves another break point on her way to a hold
she not on top however and keys looks most likely to break
however if radwanska manages it here then she takes the set
break back
she done it
when serena broke early in the set most would have expected the american to race away with it like she did in the second
however lisicki is a fighter and breaks back in the third thanks to williams pulled backhand
williams is struggling to get her first serve in at the moment but it does seem to be hampering her too much she raced to a lead before allowing her opponent a point after missing a low forehand then forcing a mistake from cornet to take game

can she keep her nerve
sharapova ends up cruising to the second set
she is looking good now as the match heads into a decider
bartoli will have to match her or this could be over very soon
the serving is excellent as williams races to without giving her rival a sniff
muguruza attempts to get on top of a second serve and the results are excellent as she sends williams the wrong way with a forehand
shot responds williams
you ca argue with that
a lob in the next rally looks to put muguruza in trouble but she retreats to execute the perfect smash
however an ace hands the game to williams
too good from radwanska in that rally
a rally ends with li going long after typical accurate hitting from the pole
she will now serve for the set
li copes well with vinci dangerous backhands coming into the net again and this time winning the point with a stunning volley
an aggressive forehand brings up two more break points for the chinese player
she takes it with some strong forehands from just inside the baseline
what a start it been by the australian open finalist
better from safarova who powers an forehand into the corner for before she repels some heavy hitting from her opponent to earn three game points

a hold to love for bartoli
she now one game away from the match
the crowd tries to lift lisicki as she prepares to serve but she must know that she has lost this
sharapova takes control of the second set as her power proves too much for the who makes mistakes on every point to hand the russian the game
it is looking a bit ominous for the canadian now
a comfortable service game to brings up the opening set for li
she been utterly brilliant so far and sharapova yes sharapova has had no answers at all
the russian is in trouble and must come out fighting in the second
pennetta races into a lead mainly thanks to her trademark backhand but vinci remains in the game with a super drop shot that leaves pennetta stranded at the back of the court
vinci then gets the benefit of a net cord and all of a sudden we have a game on here but pennetta holds her nerve to convert a volley out of the reach of her opponent
williams holds to as errani fails with an ambitious

the defending champion responds in the next point with a stunning forehand and breaks with a forehand down the line
at advantage radwanska twice keys gets the better of two rallies to finish with big forehand winners
that overall of those for the american
however radwanska finishes with an ace and a really tough service hold
that could be crucial
some excellent play from robson allows her to dictate the early points from the baseline but wozniacki recovers with excellent defensive play firing a backhand behind her opponent
wozniacki defence again plays a big part as she breaks robson with a clever lob and good backhand at the net
the dominance of each player serve is leading to a not very competitive contest at the moment
fascinating certainly but there not been a sniff of a break yet
and there it is
makarova plops a tame shot into the net and it the perfect start after the long break for the czech
poor from makarova though
comfortable hold for li as zakopalova hits a forehand into the tramlines
can she break again for the win here or will we go on all night

azarenka is still in a very low gear but seals the set with a quite marvellous lob
sharapova looks like she on her way to a comfortable hold of serve as she fires a backhand down the line but a double fault on the next point keep vandeweghe in contention but another stunning stroke down the line from sharapova and a long return from the american allow the fourth seed to consolidate her break
keys is continuing but she winces when netting a backhand on the opening point
venus senses her moment but despite creating two break points keys mixes her trademark power with a soft touch at the net to seal an impressive hold
she needed that and i think it safe to say she wo be retiring from this match
serena appears to have got accustomed to the muguruza serve now and a first serve is drilled straight back at the spaniard for that soon becomes two break points when muguruza goes long but the first is saved by some huge hitting from inside the court

however williams clinches the game with a forehand from well inside the baseline
williams has quickly stamped her authority all over this match
barty looks rushed by the power of the world number one and williams is up in next to no time
that much better from the though who goes with serena before drawing the mistake at the net and williams shows a bit of weakness in throwing in a double fault
however a first serve finds the mark and the break of serve is consolidated
break and set
li moves to as she did twice earlier on in the second set but this time is able to convert the advantage and grab the set
we headed to a decider on centre

the champion hits a couple of crisp winners and she has the hold
azarenka seems to be sussing out the serve a bit more but that only half the problem
even if you keep the ball in play you have to deal with serena huge groundstrokes
no she ca
two more awful shots the first a baffling attempt at a forehand winner when over the highest part of the net concede the game and that now three in a row for the american
she improved certainly but there a strong element of sharapova imploding and she has to sort it out
sharapova breaks
we have a third consecutive break as sharapova wins game three to significantly though unlike the server in the previous two games knapp was serving from the northern end on this occasion
massive moment for maria who should close out comfortably from here
vinci is creating openings for herself on the williams serve but so far she is taking them
a glaring miss with her forehand helps williams create two game points
however from then onwards serena looks nervous and despite saving a break point she goes long on a second and vinci has the break without doing a whole lot
interesting

can she take it
no
she squanders the chance as she a forehand but she earns a second with a brilliant backhand winner
azarenka survives for a second time and then again for a third time when williams chips long
finally azarenka earns game point but we go back to deuce again as williams sends a forehand down the line
azarenka wins the next two points to hold on though and that could be crucial
it another hold and again it quite comfortable
as it stands we heading into a breaker but i suspect we might see a break in one of the next four games muguruza strikes early with a beautiful passing shot before radwanska goes wide to concede the spaniard power helps her prevail from a lengthy exchange to earn three break points and although the first is saved the second is converted when radwanska slices into the net

stosur has other ideas though

after the opening two points are shared the court opens up for keys to make what should be a relatively routine passing shot but she it by several yards

the fourth seed needs to wake up here
kvitova has gotten into a rhythm on her serve now and she eases into a lead

i think that williams is intent on finishing this one quickly

a great start for the
a good and important hold for pironkova
radwanska cannons a return wide and the bulgarian stays alive in the set
a winner from li there and she races up inside minutes
there not a lot going for cibulkova at the moment and if she loses three more games without coming back she will taste grand slam final defeat
this has been a strong response from li after a very unconvincing first set
to be honest she fortunate she against a player who has never been in a final or she might well be a set down
another gruelling service game but this time it ends in success for stephens
she got a game on the board and that will be a boost to her

however the pole takes the game and we with serve at the moment
and there it is
wozniacki makes things interesting
a quick hold would be very welcome
or at least just a hold

it another comfortable service game and the dominant azarenka is three up after just nine minutes
could be a swift day work for the
radwanska races into a lead as the game looks to be following a similar pattern as the rest in the set but the american hits back as she finally produces a solid return game before firing two forehand winners to tie the game at keys lets radwanska earn a game point with a loose forehand into the net and she would come to regret that as the pole produces a fine backhand down the line to repel a fierce baseline drive from the to seal the game
a good contest in that game
sharapova opens the second set with a hold to love and she is looking far more convincing than she did minutes ago

the break is sealed when halep gets her opponent on the run who ends up driving a backhand several yards over the baseline
two doubles in a row
a game that started with such promise ends in the worst possible fashion for li as she slumps to a lost service game
we back level

my my
what a response from bartoli
she outpowers sharapova who could only manage to get to game well and truly on
well that was pretty easy for world number one azarenka
stosur is playing too many shots down the middle of the court at the moment
this is vintage clijsters at the moment as she holds
she only needs one of them as kvitova goes wide and long with a forehand
we back with serve when a few minutes ago it looked all but over
the russian breaks to love and breathes new life into this set
it hard to say if wozniacki choked a bit there
it was more down to kuznetsova hitting although the dane did take a bit of mustard off her serve

li finds a backhand that just hits the sideline to save the first but she hits the net on the next point and azarenka is right back in this first set
this is getting silly now
i ca recall the last time one of these two held their own serve
radwanska now leads with a serve to come
so expect it to be four each shortly
knapp breaks back
perhaps sharapova is not quite in total control
she wins a brilliant point with a stunning forehand winner to level the game at but then wastes her good work with unforced errors to hand knapp parity in set two
knapp deserves much credit for staying in the game final point which lasted strokes
seriously what is happening in this match
safarova eases to a love hold and williams seems on the brink of capitulation
azarenka looks to be finding her form again but some great attacking returns from li allow her to take the game to deuce

much better from williams
she reads the serve perfectly throughout the game and the american suddenly has three break points thanks to an unstoppable return with the forehand
muguruza hits back with a forehand winner of her own and a wayward stroke from williams makes it ace
what a time to deliver one of those
not only does muguruza save three break points but she wins the next two points to take the opener
are we heading for another shock
lisicki is on fire cranking up the pace behind her serve resulting in some sloppy returns from kanepi before an ace from the german helps her clinch the game leaving her just one game from the
venus misfires once more and it comfortable hold from the czech
nothing is giving just yet from either player but it will have to sooner or later
who has more nerve
a good service game from cornet her forehand catches williams out on a couple of occasions and her accuracy seems much better than in the previous game
the number one seed breaks at last as lisicki hits long on the first
that was her fifth break point of the match and the first she converted
still no game in this set for the greek and azarenka will now serve to wrap up the match
arthur ashe stadium erupts as an ace brings up the hold for serena
it been far from a vintage performance from the american in fact it been well below par at times but she back in this one now

a strong recovery from the russian has levelled this second set with the pressure back on kvitova to respond in her next service game
robson gets back on serve and is well in the ascendancy now
stephens looks a bit shell shocked while the brit is covering the ground well and putting plenty of venom into her strokes
a quite incredible passage of play continues on court one as stephens forces the fourth break of serve in as many games
bartoli just could not live with her young adversary at the baseline in that game getting caught each time she was forced to be conservative behind a second serve
great point
venus was dragging kerber all over the place there but hits a volley into the net
set point
kirilenko opens with a couple of errors but she comes out on top in a gruelling exchange by sending a backhand volley into the open court

she brings up two game points with a big first serve and a fine is completed with a forehand winner down the line

a careless forehand from the american gives kuznetsova a chance to break and she does when the top seed smashes her forehand long
she wraps up the game with her third winner on the trot
huge pressure now on bartoli to hold her nerve and serve it out
can she do it
lisicki return on the next looks like it might creep over but it just dies at the net and radwanska is able to stop the rot she lost the previous three games
lisicki with a much more confident hold there
she wraps it up with the first ace of the match
her powerful serve is starting to heat up
an extremely comfortable hold for radwanska who is now a game away from the wimbledon quarters
clijsters is just about hanging on here as she holds because of robson dumping a pair of forehands into the net
the seed does hold on the next point though kneeling low to push a forehand up the line that bouchard can then only drag wide with her backhand
muguruza should be ahead but wastes a routine return off a second serve before only finding the net with a forehand from inside the court
sloppy
a sublime defensive lob takes radwanska to three game points but muguruza stays alive with a forehand winner
that followed by a backhand winner and a radwanska error and all of a sudden we are at deuce
the pole survives though despite being taken to a second deuce but muguruza will serve for a place in the final
another ace down the middle takes williams to before a big first serve sees the spaniard go long with a return
a second ace of the game the ninth of the match earns three game points and the first is taken when a forehand is miscued by the seed

whether it nerves or the volume of power shots that are coming back at her muguruza is wilting now

another really good point sees her work cibulkova across the court before finishing with an easy net winner
she needs just one more game and her opponent can not stay with her in this set
confident stuff on serve from robson has the court one crowd roaring in approval
kanepi clearly moved inside to put pressure on her opponent serve in that game but to no avail with the brit responding strongly to claim a comfortable hold
kanepi must now serve to keep the second set alive
azarenka regains some confidence with an unstoppable forehand winner to get to but an attack of the second serve is wayward from the belarusian moments later
it is the right tactic though and she capitalises on another weak serve before halep goes long with a backhand
azarenka should punish another second serve after taking control of the rally but an unforced error from the back of the court leaves her frustrated
a superb forehand return winner gets azarenka back to deuce and a double fault brings up break point
brilliant
azarenka controls the point with some excellent ground strokes and delivers a fine drive volley before halep drifts wide with the running backhand
serena her usual self when she has the ball on her racquet but she looks so lethargic
she does have to do any running to open up a lead but she allows bacsinszky to remain in the game as soon as the rally is extended past a few shots
another bacsinszky winner takes her back to but serena gets the hold when her opponent sends a return wide
venus ca buy a first serve at the moment
however a booming forehand saves one break point
a good response to losing that first set from the romanian
she wins her opening service game after forcing azarenka wide with her return
vinci serve has got a lot of pop on it but she does half direct it into the right places
three first serves in a row all force errors out of pennetta and she edges back in front
a fourth return winner from lisicki saves the first game point but radwanska converts on the second taking charge of the point before easing a forehand into the open court
williams looks a little vulnerable here after being overpowered by the but after falling behind the american finds two huge first serves
however bacsinszky is playing some unbelievable tennis and after hitting a return winner to save a game point she takes the next two points with a lob and a backhand to seal the first break of the match
we could have a game on here
another ace from kvitova moves the czech ahead and that quickly becomes following a powerful smash from the middle of the court

brilliant tennis and bouchard is just struggling at the moment
kerber dumps it into the net and it break point for venus
the american looks some talent consolidating her defensive play with some aggressive hitting and a fine forehand down the line brings up watson then nets to hand keys three break points and she takes full advantage with a backhand winner

mladenovic is not doing too much to threaten this service game as a couple of errors put vinci into a comfortable advantage
an ace sets up the game which is finished off with a stunning whip back across the court
an early ace is again followed by some erratic serving including a from robson
a backhand drops just wide to give wozniacki and another sees the dane go two ahead
as i say that she responds with a fantastic piece of net play first pulling azarenka in with the drop shot before hitting the volley to the other side
what a recovery from jankovic
sharapova powered her way into a lead before the serb stormed back to pick up the first break
she is doing really well at using sharapova power to her advantage early on here
serena opens with an ace but cibulkova who has shown no let up in her is encouraged at she has a good play in the next rally but serena is extremely fortunate when the ball hits the tape and drops over
it could be one of those days for cibulkova
serena holds to with a that is returned
keys shines early on in the fourth with a splendid ace that flies beyond her opponent at
a brutal smash then sets up a reply from radwanska that flies wide down the line
the score moves to as the american sees the ball loop over her head and out

there it is

now she will serve for a place in the fourth round
it still looks pretty comfortable for cirstea as she consolidates the break
watson works hard from the back of the court as she tries to put her opponent under pressure but the romanian dominant forehand clinches the game for her
another love game for makarova who moves quickly inside on successive points to close out a comfortable hold

fantastic set from the underdog
muguruza shows some fight by stepping into court to drive a backhand into the corner before serena concedes another double fault her seventh of the match
surely there are nerves just yet
muguruza earns three break points with a booming forehand from the back of the court and a williams error sees one of the breaks retrieved
the start of a miraculous comeback
you never know
knapp breaks
sharapova third double fault gives knapp a second break point which is converted when the third seed pushes a forehand just beyond the baseline
knapp continues to play with real aggression and is duly rewarded as she comes out on top in two powerful forehand exchanges with sharapova who then donates a couple of backhand errors which are gratefully received
in other words knapp wins four consecutive points and holds to
two aces and a wild muguruza forehand allow williams to reach before muguruza just misses the baseline with a return
important service game coming up
sharapova goes long as she attempts to clip the baseline with her backhand but she gets it second time around the level the game

the secures the break back with a brilliant backhand into the same corner to quell the fightback from makarova
this is a game for azarenka who has lost the last seven in a row
but when williams is timing backhands as well as this winning a point is difficult
the american sweetly dispatches one down the line to take the score to but azarenka responds with a winner of her own
williams is just too good right now though as she hits another winner and then forces a break point
azarenka saves it with a big second serve which williams can only net and she holds on to win a gutsy game
she yells come on and the crowd responds with loud applause
as i feared at the start it becoming another whitewash
a shame but sharapova just has too much power for most in the wta tour in fairness
williams wastes no time in easing ahead in the game firing down an ace for but a second double fault reduces barty deficit
however in trademark fashion a blistering ace brings up two set points but an inspired backhand from barty keeps her in the set
it not for long though and another huge serve helps williams take the set
stephens holds for the concession of just one point
she right in this second set
a promising start on serve for robson putting a kick behind her first serve to quickly rattle off her opening service game to love
the court one crowd thoroughly enjoyed that game from the teenager
break back
ivanovic saves the first two but azarenka grabs the third by coming to net and putting away an easy overhead
can the belarusian now keep her cool and serve to stay in the set for a second time
it stuff for lisicki as she hits wide with a forehand to gift serena the break
it was ever so fortunate though for the top seed though because of those two dead net cords
quick hold from azarenka
her first serve percentage reads which is bad azarenka holds comfortably again and stephens will have to start getting into her serve a little
a good response from radwanska then who holds fairly comfortably to force errani who will be nervous to serve out the set
instead she decides to win the point after an astonishing rally
she first on defence but turns it around to win the point with a big smash

after that gutsy hold last time out azarenka must be deflated
kanepi makes a strong start to her service game but a double fault keeps lisicki in touch

she been displaying an impressive range of shots the afternoon and can still get back into this match if she can cut down on the mistakes
break awful start by sharapova as she comes up with two more unforced errors to hand her opponent the first game to love
excellent service game from watson who finishes with a swerving ace down the middle
much more comfortable hold that time
now she in front in the match and that was a quite brilliant backhand winner to claim the game
a really good hold after her disastrous previous attempt
when robson gets her first serve in it is too much for kvitova to handle
a solid service game allows robson to hold
the breeze on arthur ashe seems to be getting stronger but it doi who is coping the better blasting a winner for kvitova fight back to but doi comes through to regain her advantage
hampton holds
the from alabama is giving a fantastic account of herself here as another forehand passes by azarenka
that in total from that side alone in this match

easy hold for sharapova
three big first serves see her race into a lead
azarenka then fails to punish a rare second serve as she fires wide from well inside the baseline on the ad court
na gets the break
really strong play once she got to deuce and that could be the beginning of the end of this one
sharapova simply must respond
oh dear
keys sets up a point nicely for the chance to move behind but skews her forehand wide
that was probably radwanska most comfortable service game of the match so far
muguruza has improved but she misses two makable winners and that allows radwanska to get a look at the spaniard holds firm though taking the game when radwanska nets
this has been a terrific match
vandeweghe needs a big serve a to ensure that she does lose it on her own serve but she pulls a delivery out of the bag but a double fault on the next point brings up deuce
the american goes for power again to force advantage and sharapova can only return to the net on the next point to leave herself serving for the match in the next game

she is back up but she faces two break points which erakovic takes at the first opportunity with a forehand return winner
li nets and zakopalova holds on
nothing is giving at the moment so i ca see where a break is coming from
utterly ruthless play from cetkovska earns the qualifier a first set she took with relative ease
wozniacki might be best served to pull out here in all honesty effectively playing by applying weight on just one leg
robson races to a lead but then mistakes from the brit allow kvitova to take the game to deuce before taking the game with an ace
the wind has gotten much stronger since we began the match minutes ago and the errors are flying off both racquets
it williams who is struggling the most going long twice in succession to hand her opponent two game points before driving the ball into the top of the net
it was a shaky start from azarenka but she looks the more comfortable of the two now

she eases to before gifting robson a point with a double fault
however she responds with an ace to move three ahead inside minutes
that a poor game from lisicki radwanska did have to do much there
finally she gets the breakthrough she probably deserves
she was helped by some really lax play from azarenka but still trails by a break in this set
after a couple of games from both players the tennis is starting to flow a little more now with some good baseline rallies

she nets on the first but takes the second as vika curls a forehand into the tramlines

remarkably this is kvitova match of the year
incredible start
she needed a positive start to the decider and she gets it taking the game when doi nets a return

some luck at the net gives vinci break point which she then takes as mladenovic finds the mesh from close range
poor from the youngster and that could be vital in the outcome of this
errrm that now points in a row for williams as she again holds to love
what a turnaround
at kirilenko goes for a drop shot but it drops too early and fails to make it over the net to give williams a break point

she a little lucky but lisicki has broken the radwanska serve and will serve for a place in her first grand slam final
kirilenko is beginning to move sharapova around the court effectively and the former champion is looking flustered
after getting to the two russians enjoy a stunning exchange that ends with kirilenko putting a forehand into the corner for three game points
she does convert the first though instead she miscues the ball into the stands where actor alec baldwin is waiting to take the catch
that mistake disrupts kirilenko and a double fault allows sharapova to get back to deuce but after creating her fifth game point kirilenko delivers an absolute screamer of a forehand from the baseline to consolidate the break

and that followed by her first ace
absolutely vital that hold for the second seed
still going with serve this set
both women winning points with power
there not much room for breaks or rallies in truth
there are flashes though and it certainly high quality tennis
after the opening two points are shared bacsinszky controls the next rally before forcing her opponent into the error
the swiss then hits the way to the next two points to leave williams having to serve to remain in the first set

williams finds another gear to take the game and sharapova will serve for the match again

all eyes on sharapova now as she steps up to serve

kvitova manages to get through a service game without facing a break point as pennetta struggles to get her returns back in before watching a kvitova forehand fly past her to secure the game for the fifth seed

robson just spurns a chance to take charge of the first set with kanepi going back to basics behind a first serve to get the hold
the brit is clearly happy to exchange with her powerful opponent at the baseline though which does well for a match full of attacking intent
indeed she does break back
we with serve again but not really if that makes sense
williams double faults at after being called for a foot fault but consolidates the break on the next as lisicki hits out on the return
brilliant point as radwanska defends superbly to get back in the rally but errani is too strong with a forehand that the pole can not return
that said errani has looked very suspect with her smash today she either missed or passed it right back to radwanska with every one so far
she then hits to net to hand radwanska two break points but saves the first with a whipped backhand past the advancing pole
the second is saved with an aggressive net point finishing with a simple forehand
neither player is giving everything up as another wonderful net point is finished with a drop volley from the italian and she eventually holds an important game the longest of the match at minutes
vinci comes through with a hold to but you feel as though this match belongs to pennetta providing that she shows a little more aggression
she is currently too tentative when vinci begins to slice the ball
sharapova commits another double fault but it comes at and she holds for the third game in succession with a serve out wide
despite the nature of the first set this is competitive now
the tennis is not of a particularly high quality at the moment
stephens holds serve comfortably but there something of a lack of urgency
stephens does seem to want to hammer the nail into the coffin of her compatriot just yet and has taken the foot off the gas a bit
really good hold from pironkova after being down
that encouraging fighting spirit at the start of the deciding set
kvitova is on the hunt early on in the game clearly boosted after saving break points in the previous game
a forehand winner from the czech is followed by a missed effort out wide from the seed giving her opponent a lead but more unforced errors from the grand slam champion let pennetta back in
she serves well to force a wayward return from kvitova before getting the better in a baseline exchange with the fifth seed to seal the game
if it can go wrong for williams at the moment then it is doing
after dropping her first set of the tournament and tweaking her ankle williams has to battle with her hair coming loose
it yet another irritation for the world number one

sharapova eventually holds but williams will now serve for a place in the final
it a gift
kuznetsova double faults and she really has taken her foot off the pedal in this set
she allowed wozniacki back in rather than the dane playing her way back in
wozniacki has taken her chances though
all credit to her
safarova is pumped after that last game and ivanovic feels the pressure in committing a double fault to start the game
that followed with a baseline winner before ivanovic goes long with a forehand
safarova has three break points and this would be huge in the context of the match
the first is saved but on the second ivanovic slices wide and safarova has the advantage
it a comfortable hold for radwanska who drops just one point on the way to the opening game
that just what she will have wanted
i anticipating either a close match with errani winning or a radwanska blowout
we see as she serves for the first time
no danger from azarenka of breaking back at the moment as ivanovic breezes through that game to to edge within a game of the opening set
we played half an hour of tennis on ashe
superb way to hold
serena does well to get back a big lisicki serve and her return just dips over the net
lisicki has to go for broke and finds the corner with a backhand
kirilenko drills a stunning backhand winner down the line to take the opening point but sharapova begins to display her superior power to get to what been impressive from kirilenko so far is that she is getting herself into most of the rallies and it seemingly making sharapova doubt herself
a double fault and a forehand error give kirilenko break point and after she makes up a lot of ground at the back of the court sharapova blazes a forehand long and it kirilenko who strikes first

the spaniard applies lots of pressure early on and she cruises through to a lead as bacsinszky makes far too many errors on the return
muguruza seals the game when her opponent can only force her backhand attempt straight into the net
great early showing from jankovic who makes sharapova work for it and earns two break points

however she secured the first game after encouraging sharapova to slam the ball out of play
robson takes the first two points the second of which is her fourth ace but an impressive backhand volley keeps erakovic in the game
however she then makes a glaring error when attempting a drop shot and robson takes the game when her opponent ca handle her power from the baseline

the spaniard responds by the top seed with a superb backhand but she hits a forehand long to give williams the game
was that the turning point

kvitova tries to responds hitting an excellent backhand winner but she looks exhausted as she gets ready for the next point which ends in a long forehand from the fifth seed
it advantage pennetta in the deciding set
incredible
just when it appeared that halep was on her way to levelling the match she produces a shocker of a service game that ends with a double fault

both players exchange excellent tennis shots in the next two points as makarova finds a winner but sharapova follows suit with a forehand down the line
raw power from sharapova overwhelms her compatriot as she blasts a forehand across the court but a smash from the seed levels the game

safarova also begins well to race to but a couple of mistakes let in ivanovic at the former world number one looks focused at the start of this contest and she forces the error out of safarova to earn break point
it saved with an ace but ivanovic creates a second chance with a thunderous forehand down the line
safarova looks in charge of the next rally but ivanovic comes up with an awkward backhand that safarova volleys wide

the early danger signs are there when williams eases into a lead but bacsinszky remains composed to get to deuce
she then finds her way to game point before williams makes a glaring forehand error to allow the swiss to get on the board
stephens makes the breakthrough at the third attempt
robson was on the back foot in the rally and was clinging on
she eventually put too much into a forehand to cede the early ground
the difference in this set is that doi is coming out on top in the longer rallies
that happens once more at before kvitova throws in a double fault to hand her opponent two break points which she takes when the czech player goes wide
a welcome love game for the former finalist putting nice variety behind a noticeably different service action
stephens looked happy to stay defensive at the baseline in that game perhaps just taking her foot of the pedal after making her opening hold
after both players trade errors muguruza explodes into life to put away a return for another imposing point see her drill home a drive volley for two break points before a phenomenal defensive lob is followed by a winner off the ground

a measured forehand down the line is followed by some stern baseline defence securing a hold the desperately needed
robson gets a break back
she was far more proactive in that game and cut down on the errors that have plagued her early in this set
if she can hold now then she back within touching distance

a couple of winners help her to three game points but pennetta replies with a blistering return
she follows that with a volley on the stretch before vinci slices a backhand into the net

muguruza produces two great winners first on the backhand and then on the service to hold a lead
the youngster then puts real power into her shot to force bacsinszky into backhand error which leaves the spaniard with two match points
muguruza delivers at the second time of asking when her bullet of a backhand has far too much for bacsinszky
this set is getting away from the now
it was a strange point with both players looping the ball onto the baseline
however the american dispatched another forehand cross court to get the double break
she gets the second serve back this time though and lisicki then nets her backhand
she lost the last three games on the spin
a dominant game of tennis from ivanovic who takes the break with a powerful forehand that jankovic could return
this is just phenomenal serving from williams who hits three aces and a vicious winner
the american looks destined to face maria sharapova on thursday unless azarenka can find a miracle
daniilidou is having minor success at the net certainly more than from the baseline
but azarenka again breaks comfortably with another double fault to finish the game off
what a response to losing a monstrous opening rally
from down sharapova rallies to win the game and won it with a lovely drop shot that forced jankovic to the net which left sharapova on hand to hammer the backhand into space
radwanska responds nicely with a good net point but errani then shows her how that is done as well with a forehand winner
that sets up two break point but she only needs one radwanska nets from the baseline with a backhand
errani is two away from the
set sharapova the russian holds to to take the opening set inside minutes
williams is frustrated in the first point of the game as she is faced with an open court but decides too late to come into the net to volley and ends up firing her smash long
a couple of long balls from garcia allow the top seed to edge in front but the american her backhand and catches the net to bring up deuce
two big serves are too much for garcia to return though and williams escapes from a tricky service game at the start of this second set
break back
radwanska takes her fourth chance by slicing to the net and lisicki is unable to make her lob dip in
back on serve what drama
a probably decisive break for radwanska there who wins with a lob that pironkova throws her racquet at but in vain
the trainer is back
that got to be the nasty part of her job working on feet

wow that superb from watson who ends the game with an ace

as i said lisicki appeared to have given up on that set before she even began that service game
another loose backhand at gifts radwanska the set and also the advantage of serving first in the decider
azarenka is looking for another break as halep makes a double fault handing her opponent the lead but a volley from the belarusian goes long before the second seed makes a stunning forehand followed by an ace
it a confident finish to the game from the romanian
williams looks in complete control as she sends sharapova running all around the court making her opponent stretch for every shot
the result is a series of mistakes from the russian and a comfortable hold for the world number one

williams somewhat inevitably saves the first with an ace as she does with the second
unreal
can she save the third
she ca
a backhand goes wide and the italian breaks
muguruza comes up with strong work on both the fore and the backhand and she soon takes a lead following a wonderful point won on the volley that sends bacsinszky running in the wrong direction
bacsinszky is given a route back into the game with a standout winner on the backhand but eventually loses out to muguruza who ends things by forcing her competitor into another error
vinci does not let up under pressure as we seemingly head towards a tiebreak
the italian breezes through to with very little resistance on her opponent end
danger signs for williams at but azarenka ca take advantage and she sends a second serve return long of the baseline
she keeps herself in the game though forcing williams to frame the ball for the american moves to game point but concedes the softest of double faults
that pure guts from williams
after a is called after an ace she responds with a big forehand winner

but she then nets to take us to deuce in the opening game and li goes wide with a backhand on her first break point
li gets break point number two with a big backhand down the line and the game ends on a double fault not the best start for cibulkova
a quite incredible implosion from kvitova shows no sign of letting up with yet another double fault contributing to makarova fourth successive break of serve
full credit to the russia she has maximised her chances and now must be favourite to progress tonight
power from vinci this time as she returns mladenovic serve back down the line to open the scores but france hopeful comes back into it when vinci falls flat on her forehand
mladenovic goes ahead with an ace that requires a challenge only for the youngster to shoot herself in the foot with a double fault
vinci can not return from deep next up leaving mladenovic to close out an important hold when another italian return finds the net
a huge moment in the game as radwanska breaks
radwanska hits back at keys with a forehand winner and the pressure looks to tell on the as she double faults to hand the pole a lead

right on cue kirilenko finds two first serves and holds to level the opening set
neither player able to hold serve at the moment
azarenka defends brilliantly before stephens goes long and is broken for the sixth time in the match

remember neither has lost a match this year
whereas the opening game of set one saw hantuchova broken to love set two kicks off with a love service hold for the slovakian
azarenka looks bemused having made three unforced backhand errors in the game
halep has second thoughts about a challenge when azarenka finds the line with an unstoppable forehand and hopes of a response from the belarusian are raised when she watches her rival send a forehand of her own wide
the second seed hits back with a winner before azarenka finds the net to make it a couple of superb ground strokes from halep hit the perfect length and azarenka is unable to keep her response from drifting long
however a second serve is just far too inviting for azarenka to turn down as she delivers a return winner to get to deuce
halep edges ahead when her fastest serve of the match is sent back at the net
azarenka gets another second serve to attack but she hits the backhand wide and halep is one game away from the
despite having five chances to break ivanovic still ca find a way to make it count as radwanska survives to earn a vital hold and stay firmly in control of the second set
it looks like missing out on the break in the previous game has effected li as she serves her first double fault of the match immediately followed by a second to give azarenka two break points
she wastes the first with a wide shot and hits the net on the next allowing li back in to the game at deuce
the misses seem to lift li who takes advantage with a superb shot down the sideline following up with another to take the game
both players are having hot and cold spells at the minute
clijsters gained a at but that just been extinguished by some fabulous angles from robson she some player
guess what
break
i do think either player wants to win this set
jelena now serving for a lead
robson produces unforced errors on four straight points to allow kirilenko to get off the mark with a hold to love
you feel as though bacsinszky needs to break straight back to have a chance in this match but serena is striking the ball as cleanly as she has all match and the swiss has no answer
she holds to thanks to a backhand winner into the open court and she is closing in on a place in the final
after an early ace robson struggles to find her first serve
it does matter too much though as some big forehands prove too much for wozniacki before the british number one takes the game with an unreturned serve
comfortable hold to love for ivanovic and it now over to bouchard to hold her nerve and serve out the set
barty takes the first point but after conceding that lead with a double fault williams drills a forehand down the line for that soon becomes when barty hooks a backhand wide of the mark and williams seals the first break of the match with a at the net
williams nets in the first point to hand her opponent before clipping one wide for williams then to hand wozniacki but responds with an ace for wozniacki does break in the next point however when williams once more

the first serve at the body puts williams into an awkward position and she goes wide with the return

muguruza finds advantage twice but she gifts williams another break point
it wasted again as a backhand strikes the net
muguruza certainly is playing as well but she holds and that all that matters in the decider
game set and match sharapova
what a turnaround
sharapova is unstoppable in the latter stages of the final set to advance into the last four as she looks to defend her crown
having been battered in the opening set sharapova displayed her talent to roar back with some sensational tennis
williams makes a couple of unforced errors finding the net twice to help kuznetsova to a lead and the russian wins the opening game with a brilliants forehand to the corner of the court
whatever treatment she had seems to have worked
kvitova has pressed the self destruct button to drop the second set with a dropped game to love
makarova has made very few mistakes in a run of six successive games bringing this match level at a set apiece
break back
ivanovic hangs in there
she saves two match points and must now hold serve to make sure it was all in vain
she hits out with a backhand on the third though and azarenka will now serve for the match

you feel stosur has to hold this one or it could be all over
she knocked plenty of times but stosur eventually slammed the door in robson face
a really good hold for the australian
over to you robbo routine again from williams who after reaching outlasts barty from the back of the court and the game is sealed with another unreturned first serve

she looks decisive off both sides and the american is soon into a lead partly down to a backhand winner down the line
it three set points after azarenka floats a return long and she wastes no time in taking the first with the belorussian dragging a forehand wide
hantuchova breaks more carrying on from azarenka the world number two is beaten at the net by a superb forehand pass as hantuchova edges ahead
after reacting by releasing the most unpleasant scream the belarusian then double faults
that much better from watson who follows a forehand winner with an ace out wide
keys then goes long on a return off a second serve and watson ensures that she remains competitive in this set when the american nets from the baseline
a good start from azarenka as she wins her opening service game without much trouble
serena is in agony here but she hanging on in there
gutsy stuff to hold again surely she ca win this match
wozniacki holds serve
this time ivanovic attacks the jankovic serve to earn a couple of break points
the first is saved with a delicious backhand down the line and the second goes when ivanovic goes long from the baseline
she earns another with a fearsome forehand return and earns the first break of the match
li stays in touch with a hold to finishing the game off with a rare
that is massive for lisicki as she does manage to hold after being down

she done it the last two times
li makes no mistake with her second set point putting radwanska on the defensive and finally finishing with the pole netting
break nervy start from bouchard as she finds the net with her first return while her second is overhit and bounces out to hand sharapova a lead

outstanding from jankovic as she takes two fantastic final points to edge out sharapova from serve in the first set
robson serves well to take her first game of the final set including a fantastic ace along the centre line
she need to break kvitova as soon as possible to get back in this set but she not finished yet
it looks like muguruza has found the line and she appears to celebrate but the point goes to williams
the spaniard responds impressively to boss the next couple of rallies and her third ace makes it she secures the hold with a superb forehand winner
much better from the seed
quick pressure applied on the cetkovska serve with wozniacki fighting hard to level at a stray forehand from the dane helps her opponent edge ahead with a strong point finished off at the net to keep this first set on serve in the early going
an encouraging start for the czech who thankfully does not appear to be favouring her left knee so far
halep goes with her rival from the baseline and surprisingly beats her for power to get to early in the game

huge moment in the match
can halep hold her nerve
routine hold from azarenka to start the second set

maybe a few nerves creeping in for williams
kirilenko takes the game to deuce before williams finds a big serve to get advantage but then has her first double fault of the match
she responds well with her first ace of the set
vandeweghe dictates the longest rally of the match so far with a series of backhands before coming into the net to wrap it up with a volley
the russian gets involved in the net herself on the next point though to level the game
sharapova manages to edge ahead as the american slices a return wide before hitting the ball into the net on the next point to keep the early stages of this set on serve
li moves brilliantly behind the baseline firing a forehand past her opponent
she comes into the net for an overhead volley but she takes the ball to early and smashes the ball well wide
her forehand clips the net but still manages to land on the sideline and she takes the game when vinci forces the ball wide
the end looks near for doi
she dumps a baseline shot into the net and although a superb lob reduces the deficit to she shows too much aggression and make another error
she saves the first break point but kvitova steps in to convert a forehand to seal the break to move into a lead
at williams gets lucky with a net cord to get to before vinci nets a return off a first serve
the game is sealed with a serve down the middle and she is back on track
a love game for ivanovic here and she looking more than comfortable on serve
can jankovic muster anything to haul herself back in this match
at vinci produces one of her biggest serves of the match to force serena to go long
where has that been all match
however williams turns thing around to bring up a break point but the american squanders it miscuing a relatively easy forehand
vinci holds with some aggressive play of her own and she is one away from taking this match into a decider
i did think i would be writing that
unforced errors cost robson as she finds the net on more than one occasion to hand the break straight back to kvitova
it a comfortable first service game for the world number her first two serves are returned wide by cirstea before watson secures the first ace of the match
the brit has a powerful serve and it looks like it could cause the romanian some problems on the return
there so much pressure on vinci to make her first serve because she knows what is coming if she does
vinci creates three game points but the problems start when she sees the line
williams attacks and gets back to but she dumps a forehand into the net to allow her opponent to restore parity
good hold
good start to the game for the as she powers a backhand past serena to take the lead while the number one seed slams her next stroke into the net
the battles back with a strong forehand down the line and then an ace to tie the scores
however a loose forehand to the back of the court drops out and then serena slams a backhand into the net to hand keys a break in the first game
it a welcome hold for jankovic but one she was made to work hard for again
radwanska will now serve for the set
a much much better service game for keys
she was on top from the start and forced the error from radwanska to take it
perhaps this one will go to a the last set was the same but the pole took a late break
however the pole responds and wraps up her service game with a marvellous drop shot that keys can not dream of reaching
halep is making some brilliant returns making a couple of flawless forehand winners to give herself a break point but a change up in pace on the serve from azarenka takes the game to deuce
the world number two picks out the sideline with another forehand to give herself another chance though but this time slices her backhand into the net
a couple more chances for halep to get the break come and go before a fifth break point is converted by the romanian with azarenka forcing her forehand just long
and break she does as vika misfires with a forehand
one thing ivanovic is doing very well at the moment is looping the ball with less pace when she on the defensive making it harder for azarenka to move her out of position quickly
just as i begin to doubt makarova chances it all goes horribly wrong for kvitova on serve
two successive double faults start the problems with the russian attacking a sloppy second serve to earn a break to love
that came completely out of the blue but can that be the start of a revival in the second set
it errani turn for a delightful lob as she clips the line with radwanska advancing
radwanska is now just playing baseline accurate tennis and at the moment it working
that said errani comes to the net to win an forehand to bring us to deuce and takes the game when radwanska slaps long
errani will serve for the match
initially brilliant from radwanska
she plops two smashes straight at errani but wins the point on a very difficult stretching backhand lob at the net
however some poor shot selection gives errani two break points
the first is saved with a fine forehand winner at the net but she nets herself the point later and we suddenly back with serve
the pole forces lisicki to serve out the set by holding to lisicki first serve is going in of the time and if she keeps that up then it be hard for radwanska to break
lisicki has lost just one of the points when she got her first serve in
solid start from keys as she races into a lead due to accuracy off her serve which puts the pole under pressure
an unforced error hands the pole a point and a way back into the game but she then goes wide with a volley at the net to give the first game to the
big hold for azarenka who secures her second service game with a precise ace that skids off the t a couple of tame second serves from wozniacki are quickly punished as falls behind with a forehand winner crashing off the net
early chance here for the czech qualifier with two break points and she takes advantage quickly showing aggression to finish a relatively easy point with power at the baseline
robson sinks to her knees as she misses a simple backhand still on serve in the breaker
she was starting to look a bit more confident li
she looks to be controlling that service game but a fightback from her opponent gets it back to deuce
then zakopalova gains advantage but a great li forehand forces her into the error and then finally wraps up the hold
something has to give soon and it looks more likely to come from li
halep continues to struggle as he misses the court on a simple forehand with the russian again on the back foot
better tennis from the third seed as he hits a deep backhand onto the feet of makarova who ca return it while her forehand clicks into gear with a rapid return right down the line
halep earns two break points with another fine shot on her backhand but a solid serve and a miscue from the romanian brings deuce
however halep earns a break back with a solid strike and an error from makarova on her forehand
break back
despite the break cornet looks like she has no confidence and williams cashes in placing the ball all around the court and leveling the set
game and set sharapova
the champion is level
sharapova storms to a lead and has three set points to use up
she levels up the match after jankovic return hits the net
we have one final serve in this clash
doi finally gets a bit of luck when the ball strikes the top of the net and drops over
her opponent then goes long twice in succession to hand doi three game points before the japanese player concedes a double fault
a return winner takes kvitova to but doi responds with her first ace of the match to remain in the set
the support for sharapova has increased the fans do want to see this end early and i do blame them
the russian goes ahead but serena responds with three big first serves
sharapova bursts into life with a backhand return winner but another huge delivery from the american seals the game
first one saved
for a third game in a row on kvitova serve pennetta brings up a break point hitting a string of steady shots from the baseline eventually forcing a long forehand from her opponent
however kvitova survives as a low backhand from the italian fails to clear the net
pennetta finds the net again on the next point before a long return allows the czech to hold serve
kvitova certainly has played her best tennis in her first three service games but she doing just enough to stay with her opponent
just as the start of the last set kerber is not offering much resistance to the makarova serve
she gets a return in but slices into the net when advancing a really poor shot
break back
she got it again dominating radwanska from the baseline
aggy loves throwing up a high ball to challenge her opponent but again li is confident enough to the ball out of the air for a winner and we back on serve in the second
a baseline from bacsinszky tells williams that she has settled into this match but at she gets over ambitious with a drop shot and the world number one is back to she holds her nerve though as she crushes a forehand winner and an ace to take the game
li does throw it away and the slovakian breaks right back to take is into a breaker
this could go either way but the momentum i feel is with cibulkova
two stunning winners take muguruza to but she goes for too much on the next return which goes long
radwanska holds firm to take the next two points to hold and this is beginning to feel like a different match
how will muguruza cope with having to retreat for the first time in the match
they heavy hitters these two and we still on serve as clijsters holds
i get the impression that williams is slightly perturbed
she powers a backhand winner past azarenka before her opponets commits her fifth double fault
a second serve barely reaches williams and the american gives it the treatment to bring up three break points
azarenka survives a hawkeye challenge by a millimetre and she is soon back at after williams shanks a backhand
williams has the break though after azarenka disappointingly dumps a shot into the net
williams will return to serve for the championship for a second time
some big returns from li bring up three break points against azarenka serve
the sixth seed sends a backhand long before sealing the break with a superb backhand down the sideline which left azarenka rooted to the spot
another very very close wide call goes against sharapova
makarova holds serve but only because of those three near misses
sharapova will serve for the match
erakovic needs to take a step back and compose herself
she under a barrage from robson right now
she edges ahead but a forehand error and a double fault bring robson back to erakovic forehand has gone missing and another goes long for break point to robson
what a reply though a super ace out wide and we are at deuce
she ca hold off robson power though who forces erakovic into two more mistakes and she takes the initiative in the set
lisicki saves the first by tracking down radwanska volley before aggie manages to hold by hitting a first serve that lisicki returns long
radwanska now one game away from her wimbledon final
almost minutes that game took
serena comes through with two mighty serves and this match is on course to be a cracker
stephens replies in kind with two easy points to consolidate the break
she in front early in this match
game set match
serving for a place in the semis vinci starts strongly with a serve that forces a tame return from mladenovic
it soon when the frenchwoman crunches another into the net
some slight resistance is offered by the youngster at who follows it up with something bigger deep that does for vinci
mladenovic comes up short by pumping her next return wide only to respond with a massive forehand winner
a predictable error at the vital moment from mladenovic gives vinci another chance to close the game which eventually happens as the french player turns a return into the net
vinci is through azarenka comes into the net to try to get herself going in this set but double faults on the following point
she plays an excellent backhand on the next point which the stretching second seed gets her racquet to but ca get it back in play while halep misses her next return to give azarenka the game
the romanian will serve for the set next though
again the czech goes wide on break point but li does want to capitalise when she has her own advantage and skews a shot into the stands
however she finally finishes it with an ace
muguruza has started this final brilliantly but she is frustrated with herself having missed a return to move to serena fires back to reach before another huge serve earns her game point
the hold is complete when the spaniard goes for too much with a return
out of nowhere williams drops to after two unforced errors before she remains competitive with an ace down the middle
bacsinszky feels hard done by when she on the wrong end of a questionable line call but she shakes it over to drill a backhand winner down the line to earn a break point
williams saves it as well as denying bacsinszky on four more occasions but the swiss is unnerved and after middling a backhand return she benefits from a mistake from williams to break through
robson ca do anything about the first two points but a wild forehand from her opponent gives her an opening to get into the game
however the door is slammed firmly shut with an ace before robson puts too much fizz on a return
keys starts well with a well worked winner as she manoeuvres williams across the court before firing a forehand into the corner
the duo exchange errors on the next two points but williams ups the ante to take a game point with an outstanding lob to the back of the court
the shows her spirit with a powerful backhand down the line but a couple of loose strokes from keys hand the game to the world number one
she only needs one of them as an error from radwanska gives up her service game to love
the last time that happened she broke right back though
as it stands errani is racing to the semis
sharapova is looking really sharp on the return at the start of this game coming inside the baseline to take the ball early clinching the opening couple of points
a long forehand from vandeweghe gives the russian a break point and she takes the game when a lengthy exchange from the baseline results in the american firing her backhand into the net
sharapova excellent service game in the match continues with the first point as he nails her shot down the while she then works bouchard around the court to produce an error and then a winner with her backhand into the corner
the shows some fight as sharapova finds the net and finds a winner on her forehand
however the russian seals the set as bouchard commits an unforced error into the net
a very big hold here for williams
she fends off that break point to tie up this final set
more importantly she starting to find some power with her serve and net shots
pennetta shakes off the disappointment of the previous game with a winner but halep is relentless right now and crushes a forehand winner and serve out wide to reach two game points
the game is sealed with a stunning backhand winner down the line which is celebrated with a fist pump
she starting to look like the second best player in the world
watson is up but does attack the second serve well enough on the next point
watson gets a break point with a fine pass at the feet of her opponent that is returned into the net but goes wide returning a second serve
she had to to better there
after a series of deuces radwanska eventually manages to hold with an unbelievable forehand winner
after the opening two points are shared pennetta ups the ante off the ground but with mixed results with her forehand
at vinci crushes a forehand winner into the corner for game point and it taken when pennetta makes the unforced error
despite that the champion takes the game and requires just one more now for a place in the
the tide has certainly turned
muguruza is struggling to cause the same problems for williams who shows that her serve is improving by firing down a couple of aces
it a comfortable hold and that exactly what the american needs now
mladenovic opens up the second set only to be undone by great placement from the italian at the frenchwoman responds with a crunching forehand across the court that has vinci scrambling although a poor follow up wide down the line draws vinci back level
mladenovic holds her nerve however after a backhand winner and a cheap return from her opponent
vinci takes the opening point but a double fault and a winner from williams sees the american reach the world number one then steps into a return and vinci has no answer
it two break points to williams but she misses out on the first dumping a return into the net
should have made it
she converts the second though quite brilliantly

it more of the same from keys who eases into a lead with more venomous hitting
a forehand winner and huge first serve seals a love hold
you feel as though venus needs to hold in the next game or this match could run away from her
kirilenko breaks
the russian reminds us that this is not over yet as well as just why she is ranked in the world as she breaks to deuce to reduce her arrears to a single break of serve
four games in a row now for makarova what a dramatic turnaround from the russian after another composed game at the baseline
kvitova is just trying a little too hard to force those ferocious shots at the baseline and needs to regain touch by building points more slowly
when you have just been dominated for the last minutes of a set what is the best way to respond
by breaking your opponent serve at the start of a set

after working so hard to force deuce robson is unable to take advantage sending successive forehands well wide at the baseline
kanepi is playing effective defensive tennis and just forcing enough mistakes from her opponent to stay in charge of the match

do think anyone saw that coming
lovely tennis on show as muguruza sends a forehand into the corner before taking the point with a simple volley
the williams camp do look pleased when a double fault is followed by muguruza firing a backhand winner past the world number one
it three break points to the spaniard
ace
that one gone but muguruza does need all three
a superb forehand down the line hands her the breakthrough
to some extent keys has nothing to lose now and she comes out with that mentality and breaks to love

bouchard then hits the net as kvitova moves ahead and the czech holds when the canadian fires long once more
this is the williams you expect to see
she dictates the tempo of rallies much better in the game and a couple of ground strokes are too much for muguruza
the excellent defence is on show too as she chases down what appears to be a lost cause to force muguruza into a difficult volley which drifts long
a hold to love should give her confidence

a hold to to begin the set for lisicki
that her first game since the opening game of the match and just what the doctor ordered
perfect from halep
she returns with an ace to hold her serve
that much better from williams
the world number one is immediately looking to attack lim serve and gives herself two break points with some solid play at the net
a poor serve form lim allows williams to pounce at the net again and get a break early in this set

after restoring parity bouchard is unable to hold the russian back as he commits miscues on her backhand as sharapova takes the first set
break game and set
wow what an opening set
sharapova falls straight to a deficit with both shots creeping just out
a touch less power on her efforts and she may even be winning this contest
she comes back though with a nice stride towards the net after an obvious drop shot from jankovic but then hammers a shot into the net to give jankovic two set points
the leader is pegged back as she fails to deal with the spin on the champion shot but takes the set as sharapova puts another strike the wrong side of the line

muguruza eventually takes the break when she comes up with a stunner of backhand to hammer the ball down into the corner
a stroll for radwanska in that game to earn a break without having to get aggressive or force the play

that one too just the minute
break back

stunning

another short game but this time its ivanovic who finds some form mixing things up with a neat volley at the net to bring up a comfortable hold
a crucial confidence boost for the volatile serb
a hold
a hold of serve
it azarenka who opens up daylight by holding to in a game that included a delicious
looks like we be heading into a deciding third set
from serena claws her way back to in that game but azarenka comes through to hold
she just one game away from levelling this contest up
watson needs to capitalise on that game but she lets off the american with two clumsy shots and she is down however she responds in fine style driving a winner before peppering the american from the baseline to force the error
she ca continue the momentum though and keys breaks back when watson nets twice in succession
after the length of that last game that one just breezed by
radwanska was in control at least at times but there was a couple of really nice shots from keys too
azarenka goes just wide wide a deep backhand and hampton makes it three breaks in a row
she back ahead in this second set

that might be the most comfortable hold of serve we seen all match
venus goes long and it another break point for the german
a game strewn with radwanska errors sees the first break go to the italian
errani only had to be accurate there not excellent and that will delight her
a sixth successive break of serve means that this second set is now bordering on the ridiculous
a packed court one is clearly delighted with another superb response from stephens though as she uses swift movement to find a forehand winner inside the baseline
can she finally get a hold in the next service game that would boost her chances considerably
williams is looking so strong as she quickly takes a lead

azarenka misses a couple of early serves allowing halep to attack on the return
the second seed creates to break points before she watches a backhand from the seed go long before another mistake from azarenka hands her the game
this is turning into a really assured performance from keys
when she takes the initiative she is generally coming out on top
venus is doing a lot of running and stretching but so far her efforts are getting the reward
an forehand earns keys two game points before venus hits a return long
the first serve in the sixth sets up an intense rally that bacsinszky eventually takes thanks to some help from the net
the point is the start of an unchallenged push from the swiss player who moves unopposed to muguruza does get one point in but then loses out to a clever backhand down the line
radwanska takes her third game in a row and with a break here would pull level
it all going wrong for pironkova at the moment and really needs to hold now

that only intensifies when she catches the line with the backhand of the match before she lets out a shriek when vinci ca return a first serve
heavy hitting deep down the line gets the early hold for kvitova who had to recover quickly after a couple of sloppy points on serve
signs of confidence from the estonian now as she holds to love with minimum fuss

another poor forehand from watson and radwanska is now just one game away from being the first player into the fourth round
eight games in a row now for makarova with kvitova continuing to look tense at the baseline as she drills successive forehands well past the baseline
surely the rot must stop in the next for the eighth seed or it looks increasingly bleak for her chances of victory
tense times in this second set now
sharapova pulls off a magnificent drop shot to bring her back into the game at before flinging herself at the ball at full stretch to somehow play a backhand across court and level the game
jankovic then went back in front though in a cracking rally as she curves a forehand outwards to the tramlines before correctly calling a sharapova shot out to pile the nerves on the russian
break back
another return winner moves lisicki to she misses on the first break point but converts the second with a simple volley at the net
like in the final game of the first set kirilenko looks in control of the game but sharapova fights back with a forehand winner from the baseline to gain a break point
it a huge moment for kirilenko but she shows an incredible touch with a backhand drop shot that has sharapova sprawling at the net
that touch soon deserts her though and after a double fault she dumps a backhand into the net to give sharapova a clear advantage
wonderful from azarenka as she makes a rare wander to the net before putting away the volley to hold
radwanska really has had a chance on the keys serve so far and the american breezes through another game to level it
have to say it not great surprise that radwanska has made the breakthrough already

a wide forehand from the world number brings up two break points for cirstea but she needs just one to clinch the game
that six in a row for the romanian now
the of pennetta is relentless and after a backhand winner takes her to dominating a rally two points later takes her to two break points

williams shows some fight as she takes her first game in the second set having found herself down and facing three more break points

the break is inevitable and comes to williams breaks to with some mammoth striking

vesnina takes the early break or is given it rather
from down as well
williams begins the game with her second and third aces but is soon behind

you expect the world number one to rocket the backhand away but she fluffs her lines and amazingly it lisicki who breaks first
sharapova holds to the match is minutes old
awesome
that the best way to describe that game from stosur
any momentum robson had built up was trampled on there
the aussie is one game away
sharapova breaks
knapp reels off three straight points to level at deuce but sharapova quickly earns a fourth break point which she converts with a huge forehand volley
knapp complains to the umpire that the russian screamed come on before the point was complete
no action is taken though
finally stosur gets a game on the board
she may still be two breaks behind but it a start at least

tie break
a hold from robson sends this tense to a tie breaker which starts with a confident move from the brit at the net for an early lead
azarenka starts the game with a couple of big mistakes to open the door to halep who kicks it open by chasing down a poor drop shot to easily pass her rival with the passing forehand
three break points
azarenka saves one by going with a powerful forehand but her serve is broken when halep moves the seed out wide before beating her down the line with a backhand winner
key moment in the match
muguruza begins with two welcome points behind her first serve because she given a third successive free point when serena goes long with a return
a love hold is complete when another return is miscued
she be delighted with that
she finally converts a break point and we back on serve in this one
azarenka has turned it up over the last couple of games and is looking the more comfortable out there
and that could be curtains for jankovic
she hands radwanska two break points and the world number two does not pass up the opportunity
wozniacki moves ahead when williams fires a forehand wide but the american responds in the next point with a passing shot
williams then hits one down the line to move onto before wozniacki nets to hand williams williams hits wozniacki next serve long for but breaks when wozniacki nets
and that could be that
awesome attack from sharapova against bartoli who gave everything she had
it was enough though and sharapova is now serving for the match
stunning game from sharapova
i go as far as saying it was her best of the match
she had bartoli scampering all over the court
kvitova has already made errors and she throws in two more to hand doi she remains composed to get to but doi benefits from a for the second time in the match to earn break point
kvitova saves the first and she is forced to do so twice more to avoid falling behind before finally sealing the game
a pretty comfortable serve for the pole
we still yet to see a break and indeed it was radwanska on her previous serve that looked most likely to be broken
there nothing the pole can do against serves like that though
it another ace to end the set and it gone to a decider
who will come out on top
it could be a big upset here
it a great start for sharapova as azarenka double faults to hand the russian the break
make that successive point won on serve with bartoli quickly building a lead behind a wide backhand winner
an unforced error from the frenchwoman proves to be just a momentary blip with a strong first serve helping keep this first set firmly on serve in the early going
much of serena performance has been about her hitting from the back of the court but she ends two points in a row with a volley
cibulkova gets back to but another return winner brings up the chance of a double break

parity is drawn when bacsinszky fails on the forehand but her spanish opponent also comes up short with a forehand that flies beyond the baseline
the mistake does get to muguruza too much and she comes back with a powerful forehand winner
bacsinszky eventually holds strong though and closes the game out with an ace
what is going on here
an eighth double fault from williams is followed by a backhand passing shot from muguruza
this is getting interesting
the plot thickens when muguruza unleashes a magnificent backhand return winner for three break points before williams registers a ace
a big first serve reduces the score before another ace saves the third break point
this is brilliant
it gets better an ace registering takes serena to championship point before muguruza delivers the most impressive of replies as a forehand is drilled into the corner
the spaniard then hits one of the biggest returns you ever see to reach a fourth break point but she goes agonisingly long with a backhand
an epic rally ends with serena netting a forehand for a fifth break point for muguruza and this time she takes it with a crunching forehand winner
this is incredible
sharapova is playing beautifully
she holds to to level the second set at one game all
the fans seem to be on the side of the russian however the ease with which she is getting the job done has left them somewhat subdued
i tell you something serena is far from done in this match
at she makes plenty of ground to stretch to make a drop shot before catching the baseline to record the winner
it a remarkable shot
she then crushes a baseline winner for the love hold and bacsinszky has something to think about
a slightly robson allows kvitova a lead before fighting back to but the lead for too great for the czech and she sent robson out wide forcing the brit to send the ball in to the net from a tricky angle

the belarusian starts with a comfortable service game ending it with a big ace
perfect start
pennetta consolidates the break with ease as a drained kvitova makes mistake after mistake firing a backhand long before a forehand goes wide
on paper it should be pennetta who is struggling with the longer match having played two more sets than kvitova to get this far while also competing in the women doubles with compatriot sara errani but it the czech who is flagging
the intensity from serena has lowered in the last few minutes while cibulkova looks determined to make something happen
the seed hits a forehand winner for before connecting with an audacious volley at the net for two break points
huge response from serena though who rattles off four consecutive points two aces a unreturned first serve and a backhand winner to her margin

through gritted teeth wozniacki keeps the second set on serve doing just enough with precise ground strokes at the baseline

there an air of invincibility about williams now
azarenka is doing a lot wrong but two aces help take williams to the american throws up a second serve but after she connects with the return it point over
oh yes
a thunderous forehand volley makes it before azarenka double faults to give the russian another break
this is very one sided right now
sharapova serving for the set
that better from the champion who responds with three straight points to move to the brink of the game

keys goes wide with her backhand at to hand radwanska a game point but the american then produces one of the shots of the match as her forehand clips the corner of the baseline
the pole is forced to dig deep to fend off the challenge of the and manages to carve out an advantage which is taken when keys goes long with her attempted forehand winner
a good battle here
one break back
an extended rally ends with bartoli hitting long and that one break back for lisicki
she could do it could she
barty receives a big cheer from her home supporters after taking the opening point and she moves ahead when the american loops a return wide

keys makes two unforced errors to gift watson but the brit then misses with an ambitious lob on the
watson moves to game point when keys ca return a first serve but the nets twice to allow the american back to deuce

robson comes as close as but clijsters extinguishes any hope of a break with a classy forehand
the belgian now within a game of the first set
garcia her return catching the ball on the frame of her racquet but the ball remains in play deceiving williams
however the world number one finds a couple of big serves including on ace to keep her in control of the game
comfortable hold for radwanska
watson did get into a couple of rallies but once the points get like that you do fancy the pole
hampton flinches with the finishing line in sight
she misses four forehands in a row but will now serve to force a third set
can she hold her nerve
comfortable hold to love for azarenka
a big serve followed by a big forehand seals the deal
a couple of poor shots leave things at but there is no mistaking mladenovic next move as she rushes to plant over the net
a forehand volley winner sets up the hold but the the youngster fires long to give vinci another shot
the italian can not return the next one and mladenovic noses out in front
just as i thought radwanska drop shots could get any better she finds the line from deep to move ahead and holds with keys going long with a return
now the pressure is on the american to serve to take us to a breaker
the dane shows tremendous spirit to save two break points mixing things up to switch play at the baseline
her joy is shortlived though with the ninth seed sending two forehand long in quick succession to hand her opponent the vital break
it looks like the former world number one is helpless to prevent another early wimbledon exit at this stage
half an hour ago it looked like the number one seed would be on her way home but now she looks sure to reach the as expected
azarenka is showing plenty of guts
she commits another double fault for but she gets out of trouble with some monster hitting sealing the game with a forehand into the corner
this is over two break points
the first is saved
indeed she does take it at the first time of asking
that was a set of the highest quality you will see but sharapova did just about enough to take it

no remember
vinci gets the better of li in a rally but makes the first double fault of the match
a strong serve from the italian sees li return the ball to the net but vinci backhand does the same on the next point to bring up deuce

the chinese player will serve for the first set again next
safarova breezes into a lead but williams stays competitive when putting the czech under enough pressure to miss a passing shot
the american gets to with a crushing backhand winner down the line before she gets a look at a break point after a marvellous backhand return
that taken when safarova double faults and we are back on serve

a few big moments coming up for watson but a fine forehand winner from inside the court eases matters and take her to a weak drop shot hand the brit three game points and that terrific tennis from the who moves her opponent around the court before sending a backhand down the line
williams opens with a double fault before smashing the ball into the net
she responds in timely fashion and a forehand from inside the court take her to before azarenka frames a baseline shot
it worth remembering that azarenka was two breaks down in that second set
it was a remarkable turnaround
kerber saves the first with an impressive forehand but double faults on the second to gift lisicki one break back
bacsinszky is looking hold serve to stay in the first set and she obliges with a good first serve that muguruza comedically sends into the crowd
the spanish player hits one a little too long on the attack to draw the scores level before bacsinszky takes a lead by forcing a backhand error
the game is completed as muguruza is unable to put a return on a strong serve from muguruza
both players are mixing their serves well in this contest
the pressure is all on vinci at this stage and serena is aware of it
she on the attack at the start of each point and it pays off with a return off a second serve proving too hot to handle for the italian
there finally is the break and it following another atrocious line call
this time keys forehand was called in but it was some way out with it the pole takes the set without the need for a breaker
no problems at all for the italian who took control of that set from about the midway point and deservedly claims the first
this will be a big test of radwanska character
williams looks in the zone again and a takes her to both players tamely find the net to see the score progress to game point for williams but she is picked off by vinci after making her way to the net
the italian is pumped and she steals the break back when serena throws in a double fault
this match is incredibly tense
after a shaky start williams has really found a good rhythm with her serve and it an easy hold for her

an important hold from her there

lisicki has been just superb at the net today and she continues to be so in this game with a powerful smash to give her a lead before she takes the game with a drop shot which results in an from kanepi

serena is going through the motions on her serve and she records another ace on the way to three set points
safarova saves the first by forcing williams to net with a backhand on the stretch but she takes the second with a big serve out wide
there been no signs of the illness that plagued her against bacsinszky and that spells trouble for safarova
what that an easy service hold
this match just keeps on surprising
li fights back late in the game with a big forehand down the line then zakopalova nets but when li goes long we go back to parity
we at the business end now
more encouragement for watson who wins the opening point but again the power and accuracy that keys is finding with her serve is terrifying for someone who is and she eases through the game with a couple of quick points
watson will return to serve to remain in the match for the second time
more brutal hitting from williams takes her to but safarova responds with an outswinging serve to force the mistake from the american
it not enough to discourage williams though who hits through the ball two more times on a return to leave safarova with no answer
this is brutally good
watson recovers well to take the opening game of the match from behind
she did panic early on and it a good start
a gutsy effort from the serb as she forced radwanska to serve out the match at in the second set
the pole has looked unflappable at times and one more hold in that form and she is through to the last eight
makarova has really seized the initiative in this second set slamming a fierce return down the middle to take full advantage of an game on serve from kvitova
the russian will now serve to level this match with new balls aiding her cause
williams looks on course for a solid start to the decider but despite reaching she finds herself facing a break point which is taken by safarova when the american goes wide
a break of serve would hand stakhovsky the set but federer holds to love not offering the ukrainian the slighest glimpse
djokovic takes a lead but a missed forehand followed by a poor forehand allow dimitrov to edge ahead resulting in the top seed throwing him racquet into the air in frustration
he gets it back to deuce but misses a volley attempt while sliding into the net to return a drop shot before returning wide on the next point to allow dimitrov to keep the set level
in contrast to murray dip during service games federer is serving better now than at any point during the previous three sets
however a poor drop shot from the second seed followed by a stunning backhand from the scot brings up break point
he dictates the rally sending federer the full width of the baseline and it too much for the swiss
murray is right back in this set
it a fast start from djokovic who uses his forehand to force murray to attempt lobs which both fail
a huge serve down the middle brings up three game points before a love hold is completed in majestic style as the world number one dinks a drop shot over the net in response to murray heavy slice
the backhand falters for novak a little back on cilic serve but his opponent then fails with one of the worst chips i have ever seen in the history of tennis
cilic moves back in front when djokovic is forced into an error of his own but they do not call him the world number one for no reason
he comes straight on the attack with a wonderful forehand winner to tie the scores
more mistakes from cilic arise what that
another break
okay then novak completes the game when cilic double faults for the second time
very little resistance from almagro on the ferrer serve
he holds to love and is quickly level
it a matter of time for the ferrer break i think
what this
dimitrov cruises to this game
smart play from the bulgarian forces djokovic to do all the running as he picks his spots
he manages to hold his serve and narrow the deficit
djokovic is now serving for the first set
stan finally levels up the set at two games apiece but he been made to work so so so hard to win his own serve here
gasquet is threatening a major scalp and again it only a matter of time before he breaks the wawrinka serve
at the moment he showing more heart
this is beginning to look ominous for rosol
nadal is really imposing himself in every exchange and the czech is getting much of a look in
he holds to love
wowzers
i feel sorry for the ball in that rally
the pair trade huge blows before wawrinka directs a beautiful backhand down the line for a lead
however falla unfazed and a forehand winner brings up but wawrinka produces two serves that ca be returned to level the set at three apiece
there are some obvious nerves from the belgian as he misses two of his opening three first serves allowing murray to come in from the baseline an attack forcing a couple of errors from the world number goffin mistimes a forehand as he sends the ball into the net to give murray a chance to break but his forehand goes just wide as he tries to wrap up the game
however goffin nerves continue as he fires long on points to give murray the break
federer fires down his fifth ace of the match to reach before bringing up three set points after a matosevic error
the world number goes for broke on the next point but he goes long to fall two sets behind

can he hold his nerve this time
first set nadal sealed with an ace the spaniard holds to to take the opening set he takes it straight away as janowicz attempts a drop shot but ca get it over the net
superb start from the man who started as underdog remember
we have to remember that monfils is actually a very good player
he just being made to look ordinary by a superhuman nadal today
however he just about gets the better in that game with help from a ace
amazing
i do think there is any question now that nadal is struggling physically to chase down these darcis cannons across court with the belgian taking advantage to earn a hold
if the spaniard harbours any realistic hopes of a comeback he surely must hold in the next service game
murray takes the first point after a backhand slice makes berdych slip and he down again on the next
murray has but berdych successfully challenges an to register an ace and a net cord helps berdych get back to however it break point to murray after a backhand makes berdych volley into the net and it taken when berdych ca handle a backhand

the belgian slices his forehand wide to give tsonga another chance to break
he hands tsonga the break making another double fault
goffin heads back to his chair looking deflated
federer backhand has been a thing of beauty this evening and another passing shot off that wing takes him to it is enough to discourage matosevic though and he powers back to hold serve
despite that shot ferrer holds comfortably again finishing off with a forehand that almagro can not return
no chance of a break for almagro so far
another good second serve takes him to a love and a comfortable hold following some djokovic forced errors
it his first serve that rarely finding the target at the moment but no problems with his second serve so good for now
superb forehand down the line gets paire back in the game at and he works it back to deuce
both men make mistakes and federer edges a very game aside from a glorious forehand to glance it past paire to win it
federer goes millimetres wide with a passing backhand but it a comfortable opener in the second set for the frenchman
all too easy there for djokovic who mixed things up with aggression at the net to claim a advantage
that will probably prove enough to see the serb progress but he will want to maintain focus and end this match with minimum effort
whatever tsonga can do cilic can perhaps do better the croatian returns with an untouchable game of his own which is concluded with an ace
another quick service game and break points are becoming few and far between here
first point to murray who connects with a return but a perfect ace down the middle earns parity from dimitrov
he mixes it up with a serve out wide that murray ca return and a comfortable volley at the net sees him bring up two game points
super game from the who takes us into a with an ace out wide

wawrinka continues to mount a fightback and takes his first game of the set
very comfortable opening service game for murray as he loses just one point on his way to levelling the set
i wonder what the odds would have been on murray serving more aces than janowicz
he now has seven to the pole three after another
whoosh
petzschner slams an ace past almagro and holds
the spaniard will serve for the opening set
murray channels his disappointment from the last game to find a series of big serve giving murray a lead
federer gets the ball back in play engaging the brit in another lengthy rally but it the third seed who comes out on top this time to take the game
djokovic takes the first two points but he ca execute a drop shot from the back of the court and nadal easily makes the ground to hit the winner
however djokovic regains control of the game and easily levels things at the start of this second set
the opening two points are taken by kyrgios but murray is flummoxing him with his variety and we soon arrive at deuce after mistakes from the australian
he holds on though confidently enough to regain the lead
a double fault from the top seed gives muller the lead but djokovic levels it up with an ace before a long forehand puts the serb ahead and he fires another ace down the middle to see it out
this has been a set with both players surviving difficult service games and neither securing a break yet
untidy start from nadal as the spaniard gives up the first two points with two errors but klizan then clips wide to allow the spaniard onto the board at nadal hits another one long to hand klizan and he secures the hold when nadal nets
not the smooth start the number two seed would have been looking for but federer holds his serve
he founds himself down and had to rely on a couple of second serves but he wo be too concerned
there it is
djokovic nets a backhand which means that he loses a set for the first time in the tournament
it did not look likely at the end of the first but wawrinka has fought back and we have a game on our hands now
this man is a machine
shot after shot after shot from federer who grabs another easy hold with quality placement and some admirable gambling on the serve and volley
a sliced backhand gives murray the opening point of the second set but he finds the net with a forehand on the next rally

murray brings up break point when lu fires his forehand long and he takes the game when the chinese taipei player makes the same mistake on the next point
bautista agut plays a good drop shot but ferrer slips and loses his footing as he tries to reach the ball and make the return
the world number holds up his hand in apology but he does actually look that sorry
bautista agut clinches the game with a delicate volley from close into the net

however there no need as it turns out

the digs deep to force advantage and seals the game with a volley
he recovered well from a shaky start to this match
the scot has the chance to level things at but he rushes the net and smashes beyond the baseline poor tennis
murray is then following a long rally which allows kyrgios to lead murray grabs one back though as more rallying sees andy pull the cutter and the australian throws a return into the net

he saves another break point with an ace down the middle of the court
the errors return for muller though as he misses two backhands in a row to hand djokovic the break and leave the champions serving for a lead next
psychologically that was a hammer blow to nadal and he looks a little deflated as djokovic moves into a lead

federer manages just one return against the tsonga serve in the game which takes less than a minute
the world number eight has been deadly on serve in this second set
this is simply sublime from wawrinka
he crushes two absolutely marvellous winners past a floundering federer to earn a set point and it taken when federer frames a backhand
the world number two looks despondent and i do blame him
this is brilliant from his swiss rival
murray seems to have found another level in the last few moments as he quickly moves ahead following two net shots from golubev in quick succession
golubev does move onto the board after demonstrating delicate hands at the net but murray sets up two break points when his opponent fires wide
golubev refuses to be beaten however and levels it at deuce
eventually murray secures the break when golubev nets from close range
there a little bit of carelessness from murray as he sends a forehand stroke wide to allow djokovic to close the gap to however djokovic then returns the favour by sending a forehand of his own into the tramline
the next point goes the way of djokovic but a smart backhand down the line sees murray claim a much needed hold
as my colleague liam pointed out to me lopez has lost it mentally
he double faults to hand murray the break
this looks like it going only one way now
murray could do with a comfortable and he looks on course with a lead
however a sloppy backhand volley into the net lets wawrinka back into the game but he replies with an ace down the middle
wawrinka hits back for deuce partly thanks to another baseline winner but murray digs in to hold for a third time
groans from the crowd on ashe as roddick slams a forehand into the net
fognini has the break
the holds serve with another magnificent shot
this time it a backhand volley on the run that lands right in the corner
stakhovsky thinks about challenging but he knows it in and is just amazed
it an equally strong hold from djokovic who establishes a lead in next to no time
a love service hold is completed with a off his serve
but tsonga holds and he now just one game from taking a lead
ferrer looks empty and djokovic capitalises on this by sending his opponent all around the court eventually earning him three break points which takes the top seed to an easy lead in the third set

this is a point for murray and he takes it with a cute volley at the net
it another break point to dimitrov though and it taken when murray slices long

he misses his first chance to win the game when he fires a backhand wide but he creates another chance and manages to escape with his serve intact as stepanek hits the net with his forehand
that will be a bitter disappointment for the world number who surely must have thought he had the game in the bag at the top seed is forced to work hard but still earns a hold that edges him back ahead
reynolds continues to chase down every single point and that has to admired but i do expect him to tire if he continues to set that pace
djokovic has called for the trainer and will be seen in the next couple of minutes
meanwhile federer moves ahead when djokovic hits a forehand wide
federer then follows suit in the next point for before the swiss moves onto with another ace
eventually djokovic sets up advantage when federer and the serbian takes it with a brilliant passing forehand for the first break of the match
a comfortable hold for wawrinka this time thanks to a masterclass in serving under extreme pressure
the names isner and mahut spring to mind right now
oh dear
this gets worse for ferrer as djokovic gets the instant break
the longer these rallies go on the sooner murray will win
he took control of that point early on working the angle before whipping away a forehand
simple stuff from lopez to hold to love
he digging in now
surely this ca go to four sets djokovic breezes into a advantage after some fine serving and errors from murray and he holds to love after seemingly having the ball on a string as he draws murray to and from the net
djokovic radar is just slightly off in the early stages of the game as he fires long to hand nadal a lead but that quickly becomes as nadal nets from inside the court
the shot of the match follows as djokovic lobs nadal from behind the baseline but he nets moments later to leave the game level at a stunning move from the world number one hands him break point which he takes following the longest rally of the match thus far
it a much more comfortable service game from the sixth seed this time around as his first three serves are all returned to the net to give him a quick lead before a long backhand hands nadal an easy hold
that more the kind of game that had been expected from the defending champion last time
it imperative that sousa avoids falling an early break of serve behind in this second set and when he drops to it looks as though that could be the case
however out of nowhere he records four points in a row mainly down to murray mistakes and he should feel a lot more comfortable after that
almagro shots are all being played from a standing position
he not lively at all out there
ferrer holds and you sense one break would do it for him
some trademark stuff there as federer holds to love finishing the game off with a delicate drop shot
in contrast cilic is looking as alert as can be
he taking the fight to murray and the scot is yet to provide a riposte
cilic holds again
perfect start for djokovic who holds to love with minimum fuss
blake whacks another horrible forehand long to give raonic the break
this set is all but over
you would expect djokovic to have the better fitness of the two and be able to outlast del potro here
he now won eight out of eight points on serve in this set after another
the spaniard was facing a break point but comes back to hold impressively
robredo is playing bad at all but wawrinka is well on top
ever since he made his breakthrough on the major scene last year wawrinka has looked much more accomplished and it showing here
ludicrous return work from roger sees him assume dominance at off his opponent serve
stan falls to his own poor timing leaving federer to clinch a break with a return that sees wawrinka spoon a huge return into the stands
game over
this has been reletenless execution work from federer
wawrinka has not had a look in thus far at wawrinka throws in his second double fault of the match but he remains unnerved and holds easily enough to the aussie continues to show why he loved so much as he takes murray to love thirty off the scot serve
murray senses the danger and works on a rushed chip from the net that kyrgios ca get to
it soon after a forehand error from the
murray moves in front with a dash that kyrgios
another game for murray with a service that is returned into the foot of the net
kyrgios is looking perturbed
good start of his own from djokovic who moves ahead after forcing a couple of errors
he holds and we remain level
federer remains competitive in the game when nadal goes long for and although nadal achieves two game points his opponent fires back with a huge forehand from the baseline
it what a sensational rally on the next point
the duo go with shots from the baseline and it nadal who prevails when federer nets
best point of the match
murray breaks to love at the start of the third with a backhand down the line and the fight looks to have gone from haase
that might just be the quickest six points in history
falla holds to in a blink of an eye and he needed that after the end of that second set
tsonga holds to after federer loses his range off the ground
surely just a minor blip though
he gets between the tramlines this time but can not clear the net to give nadal three break points
nadal goes long then into the net and finally long again as the italian recovers to save all three
nadal edges ahead again with the advantage with fognini hitting long once more
double break for nadal who now needs just two more games
straightforward hold for murray after losing the first point and he well on top
getting the break back has given baghdatis a confidence boost as he levels the set
if both players continue playing as they are at the minute this could be a very close long match
too good from murray
a great forehand a crisp volley and a powerful smash
ferrer has the break following another close game
there little between these two at the moment
ferrer has the better range of movement but baghdatis loves playing to the crowd and has been pulling out some stunning winners early in this match
he need more if he to stay in this first set though
wawrinka gets on the board in the fourth with a hold to djokovic should have pulled it back to but he missed a sitter of a volley at the net
there been a definite drop in intensity in this set
nishikori does look interested
ferrer is his usual dependable self and consolidates the break with little fuss
the trainer is back on for the japanese
youzhny just hangs on to his serve and it be murray to serve to stay in the set again
he looks a little forlorn at his chair but i expect this to go to a
robredo continues to struggle as federer first serve proves difficult to handle before the spaniard fires long for robredo then fails to return once more for and the swiss holds with another ace
serve has been the dominant feature in the past minutes and another hold is brought up when djokovic makes two errors off his forehand
there is a strange atmosphere at the moment
the crowd seem to be already anticipating a win for djokovic but as long as kohlschreiber remains a break of serve behind he has a chance
make that four set points saved by tomic as he somehow checks back to meet a slice return at the net
superb stuff from the young aussie just as he appears to be feeling the heat on serve staying alive in the third set with a strong show of resistance
sousa battles to get ahead in the game but then throws it away by going long with a forehand
he tries a drop shot which is never a good idea against the rapid murray but an even worse idea if it going to bounce shoulder height for an easy winner
murray wraps up a close game after deuce
djokovic hits a fine volley to take the scores to before holding his nerve in a long rally to move ahead
the serb forces an error from his opponent to move to a set point opportunity and djokovic grabs it with a superb serve that forces lopez into hitting the return into the sky
it has taken just minutes for the world number one to see out the first set
bed before
do put it past him
raonic has a big serve opening with a smash
breaks will be at a premium in this match with both players being renowned for their serving federer for his action and accuracy and raonic for pace
it a good start by the canadian holding despite a couple of errors including a double fault
dimitrov nearly makes the perfect response by taking the first game of the second set but let a lead drop to force deuce after slamming a simple effort into the net
he does it again shortly after to award djokovic the advantage
he recovers to take it to deuce once more but sliced into the net to hand his opponent back the initiative after a rally
however djokovic failed to put the final nail in the coffin in an enthralling deuce battle and missed two easy shots to gift dimitrov the opening game after letting slip three break points in a game
well not that interesting
a miscued forehand and two unreturned first serves from rosol see nadal race to before the fires down an ace for the set
it an easy start to the third set for the frenchman
monfils races to a lead before a couple of brilliant returns from dolgopolov gets him back in the game
monfils finished the game with a superb backhand and is looking comfortable so far
tsonga still does look entirely comfortable with his racquet as he wildly the ball into the crowd following by a shot into the net gifting goffin an easy hold
mistakes on both sides push the scores to each where stan brings an end to a superb rally with a costly rush into the net to hand federer break point
the vital break is achieved when wawrinka sends his final response out of bounds
is that it
i lost track of the number of easy service games that federer has produced in this final
his ninth ace begins the game and his ace concludes it
djokovic responds with a comfortable hold of his own to edge ahead
both players are visibly tiring and we have reached a stage where one mistake could be curtains
you can feel the tension in this game but it wawrinka who has the better of the opening three points in opening up a lead
djokovic then nets to give the defender two set points and the first is taken with an forehand winner into the corner
we are going to a fifth and final set but we all knew that was going to happen right
deary me
ferrer commits his ninth double fault before missing with an overhead smash
on the flip side murray incredibly shouts out no to a ball that lands in and it enough for the umpire to hand the point to ferrer
correct decision
ferrer then executes a drop shot for before putting away a simple off a first serve
murray gets into the next rally but he sends a baseline shot long and ferrer holds
another clinical display from murray on serve he seems to have rediscovered his rhythm
federer makes some good returns but struggles to get on the attack
a smash from wawrinka sees him take the opening point but he gets too aggressive during the next rally and allows his opponent to level
it a momentarily lapse though as the swiss powers through the remainder of the game to regain the lead
nadal coasts the first point of the game as he capitalises on an error from berdych but the czezh responds with absolute power as he crashes two forehands past the spaniard
berdych does it again on nadal serve to earn two break points before the spaniard shows great awareness of the to read berdych at the net and telegraph his backhand past him for a winner
however he spoils his play with a loose backhand shot on the next point as he hands the game to the
klizan gambles with a deep forehand return and that risk does not pay off with the ball drifting long to gift berdych a second set he fully deserves
all too easy there on serve for seventh seed who is playing just about the perfect match this afternoon
klizan must move quickly or this match will be over in straight sets
a few early unforced errors from nadal continue to be outweighed by his class under pressure with a sublime backhand bouncing off the line to keep this tight first set on serve
darcis will serve next to stay in the set but has has shown no signs of buckling so far with a mix of power and guile
tsonga looks in control of the game at before federer caresses a forehand over the net
however tsonga blasts down the first ace of the match to stop federer in his tracks with another big first serve taking the game

that sublime from kohlschreiber who flights a drop shot from the back of the court just over the net but he goes long on the next return
the net cords are favouring kohlschreiber at the moment and he clips the net with a backhand down the line for a third break point but again djokovic stands firm
yet another break point for the german but he can do nothing as djokovic powers a forehand
a marathon game finally comes to a conclusion when kohlschreiber nets twice in succession
dimitrov takes the opening two points with ease but a double fault and a sharp return see murray get back to murray has an opening for a backhand winner but he is marginally off with his range and dimitrov takes the game with a smash
break point for berdych
much better from stan who cruises into a lead before ultimately serving out the game to level up at three apiece in the deciding set
are we going the distance
we thought we were in the previous set before gasquet pulled out a break in the game to win do be surprised if it similarly as tight here
djokovic is showing no signs of fatigue from that epic against kevin anderson nor any of the cobwebs that blighted his first two sets in that match
he takes the first two points which includes a failed challenge from cilic but the croat does well to haul himself back to with a delicate drop shot
he then has the world number one racing back and forth before finishing the point off with another drop shot and djokovic sends the next one into the net as cilic holds
istomin passes the first test the hold
now comes the much much tougher one of breaking the reigning champion
del potro hits a mighty forehand winner to save the first game point but does win the second as another forehand is called out
he should have challenged though as shows that it did catch the baseline

double break
the end is near for kukushkin as nadal breaks to the number two seed will now serve for the match on centre
it a promising start to the second from tsonga who again takes the game with a mishit federer forehand
that his unforced error so far not good enough really
stan the man gets off to an excellent start in the second set rattling off four points in quick succession to move one game ahead
there a rather subdued atmosphere from the crowd
there a sense that they just waiting for this one to explode into life

he then forced onto the back foot before netting a backhand and murray is and two down
murray attacks a second serve on the next point but he can only drill the return into the net and this set is quickly slipping away
murray secures one of the back after a long rally but he wastes a glaring opportunity to make it when he smashes a backhand wide
there not a whole lot of effort from murray to try to prevent djokovic easing into a advantage but at the serb double faults
murray then steps into a second serve to thrash a backhand winner past his opponent before dominating the next exchange to get to deuce
remarkable stuff
however djokovic responds with an ace out wide before murray just misses with a forehand return
murray has called for the trainer at the changeover
lu struggles with his ball toss early in the game causing him to miss a couple of first serves before he fires a forehand into the net

now then

djokovic can only stand there watch and admire
now he serves for the set janowicz holds but he made hard work of it
all the errors are coming from his racquet with in this set alone
devvarman count is substantially lower but that becuase he just is going for broke
how is nadal doing this
wawrinka appeared to be heading for a break when he opened up a lead but nadal battled back to win the next four points to take the game
he may not have served any quicker there but it did seem that the spaniard was moving a little more freely
let hope so
break back dolgopolov finds himself with the chance to break back and is gifted the game when monfils misses his first serve before putting a forehand in the net

that was a hold from nishikori
evans helps him out with two unforced errors but a fine was impressive from the world number evans is showing so much desire in this match and he records three points in a row to get back to deuce but he goes for too much on a return before slicing the ball into the net
it another easy hold for del potro
can he challenge the djokovic serve once again
again it a real battle of power as dimitrov races to a big lead forcing his opponent all over the place
the bulgarian gave the serb a chance of taking the game to deuce when he blasted an effort into the crowd
dimitrov held on though to take his first game
well that was emphatic
nadal has really improved his first serve in recent years and that was out in force just now
each one went wide and had plenty of kick which wawrinka could simply return straight to the spaniard who tucked away the next shot
one game apiece
he so dominant on his serve federer
i just can not see how paire can get back in this without having even a glimpse of a look at the swiss serve
will that help nishikori settle into this
he holds to love with minimal fuss
fantastic work especially off the forehand from muzza
he not going for too much here but just working robredo so so hard at the baseline
break back
djokovic appears to be in control of the game but simon levels the scores will a superb forehand down the line before following it up with a effort to bring up a break back point which he claims when the top seed taps his forehand into the net getting the set back on serve
far from convincing that from murray but he ahead at the start of the third
now we see how youzhny shoulder holds up when serving
break back
game on
petzschner fails to take his first break point but converts the second with a ferocious forehand down the line that whizzes past almagro

there life in the old dog yet
it pretty much on the nieminen serve before haas completely skies a backhand and puts a drop shot into the net for nieminen to level once more

another comfortable forehand following a powerful serve brings and djokovic holds when federer slices one high into the air
davydenko looks to have found something
his serve is too strong for federer as the russian easily holds serve for the first time in the match

but only just
important hold for gulbis after those two break points
i ca quite get over how subdued the crowd are
maybe they were expecting to see the richard gasquet match on philippe chatrier and they feel
there is a bit more energy about nishikori in this game hitting back to make it and he has break point when nadal goes wide but he disappointingly hits the ball into the net and loses the following two points to concede the game
right now it difficult to see how federer is going to break wawrinka
the eighth seed is not giving the champion a look in on his serve as he races to another hold to ferrer is looking to get in from the back of the court more but dolgopolov does the same delicately placing the ball past his opponent

dolgopolov tries too hard on the return to bring up deuce before ferrer claims advantage with an ace

a couple of neat forehand conversions help him to an easy hold but he needs to find a way to break the serbian serve something that he has done since the third game of the match
nadal first serve is return to the net while an ace puts the sixth seed up
almagro fights hard to try to keep himself in contention attacking at the net to force an error from the sixth seed but a couple of wayward backhands from the world number hand nadal the game
this set is a battle of wits and both are holding their own serve thus far but can it last
one mistake will be fatal i reckon
if there one cause for concern it gasquet service which has looked erratic
he conceded three double faults in this match and another one in that previous game after being up but he survived it
haas again with a strong service game
it does look likely to let him down again and nieminen serves to save the set once more
ferrer is just one game away from the final after holding to court philippe chatrier is flat as was the bounce on the baseline that bamboozled tsonga on game point
what a point
drop shots baseline hits and even a volleyed lob from rafa are what it took to take that one
set one it a quick start to the game from murray who never gives djokovic a moment to settle and pick his spot
the scot uses the court ever so well hitting three winners before sealing the third game with an ace

nadal attempts a passing shot at the net but rosol directs a sharp volley that nadal ca reach

however that more clinical from the czech who steps into court to put away a couple of forehands

he still a break down in this set but is out of it yet
goffin takes a rare lead in a murray service game when the brit sends his forehand just wide before the belgian beats him with a solid return
however murray ups his game firing the fastest serve of the match so far at past the world number wawrinka fights back to hold for the third consecutive service game nerves of steel under pressure from both players
goffin takes the game to move in front
there life in this one but you have to fancy verdasco
murray brilliantly converts a backhand volley at the net but a wild forehand sees djokovic back at the winner is struggling a little now and a double fault and a backhand into the net give djokovic two break points and despite murray improving during the next rally the top seed breaks after latching onto a murray drop shot
game three is all about dimitrov as he hits two aces an unreturnable serve and a double fault en route to holding to murray has struggled to read the sousa match throughout this contest but at down he picks one and puts it away
sousa then throws in a double fault before murray gets the better of the next exchange to earn a break point
he gets a look at a second serve and that enough for him to set the wheels in motion to his opponent
that could be a huge moment in this match
tsonga could do with an immediate response and he had a glimmer of a chance when forcing federer to net at however that as good as it gets for the number seed and a forehand winner and a helps seal the game
after just minutes federer is three service holds away from the last eight
more good defensive work from djokovic who is just so good at getting to shots he has no right to reach
a poor attempted lob allows cilic to take the first point however while the big man shows a deft touch to secure the next with a shot at the net
two more quick points follow for a love game
federer easily holds his serve again and now needs just one game to progress to the third round
gasquet saunters into a comfortable lead in this second set
tsonga needs to gather himself and quick
he can still do something in this one but at the very least ca let this rot last for two sets
the two players begin the game with undoubtedly the point of the match
the rally must have exceeded shots before murray whipped a forehand winner past mayer
the next two points are shared before the scot sends down his fifth ace following it up with a backhand winner
how frsutrating for murray not to mention those of us following
he slams a weak forehand into the net and lopez has a break back
yet another berdych winner as he crashes nadal back past before he knows it
nadal gets himself back on track with a well worked point but again he makes a poor mistake on double fault to give the czech control of the game
berdych wins two break points as he opens the court with a lovely backhand slice to force nadal out wide before crashing a forehand past him
nadal reduces the deficit but yet again another double fault from the spaniard gives the number seven seed the game
this is not the nadal we are used to seeing
it is a fairly simple hold for novak who has to revert to some adroit play on his second service at times
an ace and brutal forehand help him on his way to a lead before the game is capped off with the truest of backhands straight down the line to catch cilic cold
tsonga gets the first ace of the match followed by the second and third as he quickly wraps up another comfortable service game
aside from in the third game of this set goffin has shown little aggression against the frenchman serve
a wonderful defensive effort earn djokovic the break of serve and sixth successive game
the pendulum has swung in the serb favour and he lets out a huge roar of approval after winning that game
stan backhand is something else
if the whole tennis thing does work out he could probably be a very successful pimp
it that backhand which helps him into a break of serve with a few ferocious returns that has gasquet scrambling all around the court to reach the shots
he warming to the task now you feel
the key to federer getting back into this match is avoiding exchanges that advance past shots and that something that happened too much in the opener
despite losing a lengthy rally he reaches but a double fault gives djokovic deuce
federer gets back on the front foot though executing a off his first serve to get the job done
stepanek continues to look extremely solid on serve as he mixes up his shots with some efforts at the net as well as some groundstrokes preventing djokovic from picking up a single point
already it feels like this set could be heading to same way as the last ending with a tiebreak
is there a better backhand in the men game than the one that wawrinka possesses
the shot that he used to send a winner down the line to level up the score at apiece would suggest that there is
he even gets a break point but a wide serve from nadal forces deuce
the spaniard goes on to complete the job but it a real escape
break and set
murray wants this set done and dusted and he goes on the attack to move to but mayer strikes back with a big first serve for however the scot blazes a return winner past the german and he has set point which he converts when mayer ca handle a barrage of groundstrokes from inside the court
rosol looks a beaten man
nadal races into a lead courtesy of a smash before rosol lets out his frustration in blasting another forehand wide of the mark
first set nadal the world number two holds to and takes the opener courtesy of a solitary break of serve
federer opens up with the serve but is thwarted by a poor return that hits the net

he soon back in it though with a comical smash at the net and he quickly moves back level with a standout ace
another beast of a serve takes federer ahead and another service sees him close out the game
break for golubev as the secures his first game
golubev gets on the board at when murray hits the net before producing a volley to level at a fine forehand then hands golubev break point but he hits the net to leave another game at deuce
murray then double faults to leave golubev with another break point but deuce two occurs when golubev fires long
eventually golubev breaks following two unforced errors from murray
comfortable hold for sousa who has a couple in a row on his own serve
bit of frustration from murray in that one i ca see what for i think noise from the crowd
not sure how he heard anything the atmosphere has been appalling today
back on his own serve federer takes control at and closes the game out with a wonderful chip on the backhand that has simon all at sea
incredible dominance from the swiss in that service game
tsonga deserves plenty of credit for remaining competitive in this match
he confidently holds to love to force federer to serve for the match
he made inroads on the swiss serve in his last service game
can he go one better this time around
yet another easy hold this is starting to get a bit repetitive
this match needs a break point the crowd are that in to it either at the moment they need something to cheer
brilliant play from novak to win that
wawrinka got lucky with a net cord shot but the serb was in like a flash to dink it over the net and beyond the sprinting swiss
it a comprehensive win and already this looks like it might be over quickly
where has that come from
rola plays a superb point before sending an forehand flashing past murray
it but murray responds with a flashing backhand effort of his own to edge ahead
is murray beginning to lose focus
he concedes two points in a row to give a third break point to rola but again he comes up trumps with a off his first serve
the minor blip is over when rola nets a return and the is two games away
we go close to seeing wawrinka inflicted a broken service game as he leads with break point but gasquet battles back gamely to survive
tennis is a sport that takes a tonne of inner strength to negotiate the sternest of tests and both players are being asked to dig deep here
very deep
a third ace of the match gets murray back to but a net cord favours federer and he takes advantage to put away a forehand winner for murray replies with a powerful backhand before drilling another ace down the middle

some uncharacteristic errors from nadal get him into a hole at but he digs himself to safety with some much improved ball striking eventually holding to thanks to a trademark forehand topspin winner
kyrgios fires another two aces past his opponent on his way to another comfortable hold of serve as he does appear to be losing any intensity during his own service games
incidentally the players have now been on court for hours minutes
oh it game on now
that was a game with top five player in the world written all over it
he back on serve and picks up his first break at the very last time of asking
no jitters from verdasco at the start of the second as he holds to love with murray careless with a forehand to gift his opponent the game
not the best start to the game from murray as the scot double faults to leave golubev ahead
however golubev then nets to leave the score at golubev responds with a wonderful forehand to move ahead once more but then misses a murray forehand as the score moves onto the game heads for deuce when both exchange backhands and eventually golubev breaks with a powerful forehand
verdasco does hold forcing murray to serve the set out and send us into a decider
can he do it
it a much better service game from federer this time around
the world number two hits some fantastic shots to force errors from his opponent and also finds a brilliant overhead forehead winner to keep the fourth set with serve
can falla stop the rot
the colombian continues to battle hard but an immense backhand winner from wawrinka tells the world number that he is going to need something special to stay in this match
it and wawrinka comes up with another piece of magic blasting the ball down the line past a despondent falla
rather cheekily wawrinka challenges a call after already playing the shot but it goes against him and falla is back at deuce
the colombian is forced to save another break point but he comes through the game in superb fashion with a backhand into the corner that clipped the line
djokovic holds to following two cheap points
federer is definitely being tested far more in this second set but despite exerting pressure benneteau just can not make a dent in his opponent serve
another consummate performance on the backhand side draws the pair level at in the second set
subdued is even the word for this game right now with cilic in total control
tsonga does respond though by producing an unchallenged service game to open the third set
well if there is to be some rain murray is certainly trying to make sure he does get caught in it as he quickly notches up another hold of serve without goffin getting a single point on the board
another hold from djokovic
he looking fresher and more inventive than murray at the moment
murray got to be careful now
he can not afford to go two breaks down
there little resistance now on the federer serve but the swiss had to be alert at the net after paire reached what looked a certain winner
a good rally starts the game as berdch miscues slightly to hit the net to get nadal off the mark
the next rally is even better as both players produce stunning shots before berdych executes a delicate slice which enables him to open up the court to find a winner
a double fault gives berdych a his chance to apply pressure on the spaniard although he responds with a forehand winner across the court
both players trade winner again and nadal rescues a break point with an ace before hammering a winner to keep himself alive in the tournament
gasquet shows no nerves whatsoever in striking his way to a advantage and the game is won with an effortless off his serve
robredo will serve to remain in the set for a second time

however murray takes the next two points to earn another chance to break which he takes when djokovic miscues a backhand from the baseline
nadal gets his first ace of the match but a couple of clumsy errors allow klizan a lead
nadal is putting much more power into his ground strokes but gives it too much from behind the baseline to give klizan a chance to break back which he does when nadal fires another shot long
we are only six games in and it feels as though nishikori is already feeling a little deflated
maybe he is still thinking about those two break points chances that he missed
nadal cruises through the game and it looks ominous
this is as inconsistent as murray has performed since the start of the season
he coasting at but two mistakes allow sousa to get back to deuce

murray forces wawrinka into a mistake after a lengthy rally but an extremely sloppy backhand allows wawrinka back into the game
the swiss number two just looks too good at the moment but a net cord helps murray back in at wawrinka catches the line with a first serve and it set point to wawrinka which he takes when murray sends a return wide

a hold to love

delicious angle on federer forehand at and he again moves within a game of the fourth

djokovic then hits the net for and roger holds with yet another ace

out of nowhere he throws in a double fault and rola has the chance to break
guess what though
like last time murray delivers an ace out wide
during the next point which was being evenly contested a ball drops out of murray pocket and they replay the point but murray regains his composure to take the next two to hold serve
double break
this is really rather good from federer so early in the tournament
he makes it a double break in set two by putting away his winner with a calm forehand up the line with hanescu way out of position
you ca even get odds on a federer victory any more
verdasco with a much simpler hold to his big serving has returned to him in this set and murray has looked like breaking yet
oh how murray would take an easy service game right now
an eighth ace and a murray winner earn the number eight seed but djokovic reads a drop shot and fires his response
like earlier in the set a second serve is given the treatment by djokovic for before murray explodes into life with a crushing forehand to earn game point and he repeats the feat to force djokovic to have to serve to remain in the set
djokovic slump continues as he falls behind on his own serve
however he responds by digging in to finally put a game on the board in set three
djokovic breaks sousa is attempting to be as aggressive as possible
that decision is pleasing the fans as it is contributing to some attractive tennis
however it is pleasing djokovic even more
the serb is being played at his own game and this is allowing him to pick his opponent off with superb accuracy
he breaks to some early pressure from murray in the game ends with that outrageous diving point and the serb wraps up the game comfortable
again he came to the net in the final point he has done a few times so far today
a huge roar from janowicz as a deep forehand return at the baseline pays off earning a vital break at the fourth time of asking
the giant polish number one will now serve for the first set as kubot just gets a touch too predictable at the net
well murray seems to have forgotten about the match point

stakhovsky shows how to close it out with a pair of big serves
federer not bringing his here
we heading into a breaker
have to say that at this moment djokovic is forcing murray to do a lot of work but the world number four is holding on
that was the longest game of the match and another real test of wawrinka serve but once more he just about up to it
djokovic just can not get that break

berdych uses his first challenge of the match to question a call at the baseline with the czech player proved right to close out a hold he scarcely deserved
klizan is simply unable to step inside and catch a first serve with any conviction allowing berdych to earn cheap points and maintain his hold on the match
injured or not you got to take your chances against nadal and wawrinka is doing that right now
he had two break points at up but once again the unforced errors crept in as nadal clawed back to deuce
